<milestone unit="page" n="383"/><milestone n="383a" unit="section"/><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>Here is Socrates;  shall we take him as a partner in our discussion?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Cratylus</speaker><p>If you like.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>Cratylus, whom you see here, Socrates, says that everything has a right name of its own, which comes by nature, and that a name is not whatever people call a thing by agreement, just a piece of their own voice applied to the thing, but that there is a kind of inherent correctness in names, which is the same for all men,
<milestone n="383b" unit="section"/>both Greeks and barbarians.  So I ask him whether his name is in truth Cratylus, and he agrees that it is.  &ldquo;And what is Socrates' name?&rdquo; I said.  &ldquo;Socrates,&rdquo; said he.  &ldquo;Then that applies to all men, and the particular name by which we call each person is his name?&rdquo;  And he said, &ldquo;Well, your name is not Hermogenes,<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">i.e. you are no son of Hermes.  Hermes was the patron deity of traders, bankers, and the like, and Hermogenes, as is suggested below, was not successful as a moneymaker.</note> even if all mankind call you so.&rdquo;  Now, though I am asking him
<milestone unit="page" n="384"/><milestone n="384a" unit="section"/>and am exerting myself to find out what in the world he means, he does not explain himself at all;  he meets me with dissimulation, claiming to have some special knowledge of his own about it which would, if he chose to speak it out clearly, make me agree entirely with him.  Now if you could interpret Cratylus's oracular speech, I should like to hear you;  or rather, I should like still better to hear, if you please, what you yourself think about the correctness of names.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Hermogenes, son of Hipponicus, there is an ancient saying
<milestone n="384b" unit="section"/>that knowledge of high things is hard to gain;  and surely knowledge of names is no small matter.  Now if I had attended Prodicus's fifty-drachma course of lectures, after which, as he himself says, a man has a complete education on this subject, there would be nothing to hinder your learning the truth about the correctness of names at once;  but I have heard only the one-drachma course,
<milestone n="384c" unit="section"/>and so I do not know what the truth is about such matters.  However, I am ready to join you and Cratylus in looking for it.  But as for his saying that Hermogenes is not truly your name, I suspect he is making fun of you;  for perhaps he thinks that you want to make money and fail every time.  But, as I said, it is difficult to know such things.  We must join forces and try to find out whether you are right, or Cratylus.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>For my part, Socrates, I have often talked with Cratylus and many others,
<milestone n="384d" unit="section"/>and cannot come to the conclusion that there is any correctness of names other than convention and agreement.  For it seems to me that whatever name you give to a thing is its right name;  and if you give up that name and change it for another, the later name is no less correct than the earlier, just as we change the names of our servants;  for I think no name belongs to any particular thing by nature, but only by the habit and custom of those who employ it and who established the usage.
<milestone n="384e" unit="section"/>But if this is not the case, I am ready to hear and to learn from Cratylus or anyone else.
<milestone unit="page" n="385"/><milestone n="385a" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>It may be that you are right, Hermogenes;  but let us see.  Whatever name we decide to give each particular thing is its name?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Whether the giver be a private person or a state?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Well, then, suppose I give a name to some thing or other, designating, for instance, that which we now call &ldquo;man&rdquo; as &ldquo;horse&rdquo; and that which we now call &ldquo;horse&rdquo; as &ldquo;man,&rdquo; will the real name of the same thing be &ldquo;man&rdquo; for the public and &ldquo;horse&rdquo; for me individually, and in the other case &ldquo;horse&rdquo; for the public and &ldquo;man&rdquo; for me individually?  Is that your meaning?
<milestone n="385b" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>Yes, that is my opinion.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Now answer this question.  Is there anything which you call speaking the truth and speaking falsehood?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then there would be true speech and false speech?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>Certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then that speech which says things as they are is true, and that which says them as they are not is false?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>It is possible, then, to say in speech that which is and that which is not?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>Certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>But is true speech true only as a whole,
<milestone n="385c" unit="section"/>and are its parts untrue?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>No, its parts also are true.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Are the large parts true, but not the small ones, or are all true?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>All, in my opinion.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Is there, then, anything which you say is a smaller part of speech than a name?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>No, that is the smallest.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And the name is spoken as a part of the true speech?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then it is, according to you, true.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And a part of false speech is false, is it not?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>It is.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then it is possible to utter either a false or a true name, since one may utter speech that is either true or false?
<milestone n="385d" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>Yes, of course.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then whatever each particular person says is the name of anything, that is its name for that person?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And whatever the number of names anyone says a thing has, it will really have that number at the time when he says it?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>Yes, Socrates, for I cannot conceive of any other kind of correctness in names than this;  I may call a thing by one name, which I gave, and you by another, which you gave.  And in the same way, I see that states have their own different names for the same things,
<milestone n="385e" unit="section"/>and Greeks differ from other Greeks and from barbarians in their use of names.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Now, Hermogenes, let us see.  Do you think this is true of the real things, that their reality is a separate one for each person, as Protagoras said with his doctrine
<milestone unit="page" n="386"/><milestone n="386a" unit="section"/>that man is the measure of all things&mdash;that things are to me such as they seem to me, and to you such as they seem to you&mdash;or do you think things have some fixed reality of their own?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>It has sometimes happened to me, Socrates, to be so perplexed that I have been carried away even into this doctrine of Protagoras;  but I do not at all believe he is right.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Well, have you ever been carried away so far
<milestone n="386b" unit="section"/>as not to believe at all that any man is bad?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>Lord, no;  but I have often been carried away into the belief that certain men, and a good many of them, are very bad.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Well, did you never think any were very good?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>Very few.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>But you did think them so?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And what is your idea about that?  Are the very good very wise and the very bad very foolish?
<milestone n="386c" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>Yes, that is my opinion.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Now if Protagoras is right and the truth is as he says, that all things are to each person as they seem to him, is it possible for some of us to be wise and some foolish?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>No, it is not.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And you are, I imagine, strongly of the opinion that if wisdom and folly exist, it is quite impossible that Protagoras is right, for one man would not in reality be at all wiser than another
<milestone n="386d" unit="section"/>if whatever seems to each person is really true to him.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>Quite right.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>But neither do you believe with Euthydemus that all things belong equally to all men at the same time and perpetually,<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">The doctrine here attributed to Euthydemus is not expressly enunciated by him in the dialogue which bears his name, but it is little more than a comprehensive statement of the several doctrines there proclaimed by him and his brother Dionysodorus.</note> for on this assumption also some could not be good and others bad, if virtue and its opposite were always equally possessed by all.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>True.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then if neither all things belong equally to all men at the same time and perpetually nor each thing to each man individually, it is clear that things have some fixed reality of their own,
<milestone n="386e" unit="section"/>not in relation to us nor caused by us;  they do not vary, swaying one way and another in accordance with our fancy, but exist of themselves in relation to their own reality imposed by nature.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>I think, Socrates, that is the case.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Can things themselves, then, possess such a nature as this, and that of their actions be different?  Or are not actions also a class of realities?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>Certainly they are.
<milestone unit="page" n="387"/><milestone n="387a" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then actions also are performed according to their own nature, not according to our opinion.  For instance, if we undertake to cut anything, ought we to cut it as we wish, and with whatever instrument we wish, or shall we, if we are willing to cut each thing in accordance with the nature of cutting and being cut, and with the natural instrument, succeed in cutting it, and do it rightly, whereas if we try to do it contrary to nature we shall fail and accomplish nothing?
<milestone n="387b" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>I think the way is as you suggest.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then, too, if we undertake to burn anything, we must burn not according to every opinion, but according to the right one?  And that is as each thing naturally burns or is burned and with the natural instrument?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>True.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And all other actions are to be performed In like manner?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>Certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And speaking is an action, is it not?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then if a man speaks as he fancies he ought to speak,
<milestone n="387c" unit="section"/>will he speak rightly, or will he succeed in speaking if he speaks in the way and with the instrument in which and with which it is natural for us to speak and for things to be spoken, whereas otherwise he will fail and accomplish nothing?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>I think the way you suggest is the right one.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Now naming is a part of speaking, for in naming I suppose people utter speech.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>Certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then is not naming also a kind of action, if speaking is a kind of action concerned with things?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>Yes.
<milestone n="387d" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>But we saw that actions are not merely relative to us, but possess a separate nature of their own?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>True.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then in naming also, if we are to be consistent with our previous conclusions, we cannot follow our own will, but the way and the instrument which the nature of things prescribes must be employed, must they not?  And if we pursue this course we shall be successful in our naming, but otherwise we shall fail.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>I think you are right.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And again, what has to be cut, we said, has to be cut with something.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>Certainly.
<milestone n="387e" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And what has to be woven, has to be woven with something, and what has to be bored, has to be bored with something?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>Certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And then what has to be named, has to be named with something?
<milestone unit="page" n="388"/><milestone n="388a" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>True.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And what is that with which we have to bore?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>A borer.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And that with which we weave?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>A shuttle.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And that with which we must name?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>A name.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Right.  A name also, then, is a kind of instrument.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>Certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then if I were to ask &ldquo;What instrument is the shuttle?&rdquo;  Is it not that with which we weave?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>Yes.
<milestone n="388b" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And what do we do when we weave?  Do we not separate the mingled threads of warp and woof?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And you could give a similar answer about the borer and the rest, could you not?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>Certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And can you say something of the same kind about a name?  The name being an instrument, what do we do with it when we name?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>I cannot tell.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Do we not teach one another something, and separate things according to their natures?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>Certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>A name is, then, an instrument of teaching and of separating reality,
<milestone n="388c" unit="section"/>as a shuttle is an instrument of separating the web?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>But the shuttle is an instrument of weaving?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>Of course.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>The weaver, then, will use the shuttle well, and well means like a weaver;  and a teacher will use a name well, and well means like a teacher.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Whose work will the weaver use well when he uses the shuttle?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>The carpenter's.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Is every one a carpenter, or he who has the skill?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>He who has the skill.
<milestone n="388d" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And whose work will the hole-maker use when he uses the borer?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>The smith's.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And is every one a smith, or he who has the skill?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>He who has the skill.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And whose work will the teacher use when he uses the name?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>I cannot tell that, either.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And can you not tell this, either, who gives us the names we use?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>No.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Do you not think it is the law that gives them to us?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>Very likely.
<milestone n="388e" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then the teacher, when he uses a name, will be using the work of a lawgiver?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>I think so.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Do you think every man is a lawgiver, or only he who has the skill?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>He who has the skill.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then it is not for every man, Hermogenes,
<milestone unit="page" n="389"/><milestone n="389a" unit="section"/>to give names, but for him who may be called the name-maker;  and he, it appears, is the lawgiver, who is of all the artisans among men the rarest.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>So it appears.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>See now what the lawgiver has in view in giving names.  Look at it in the light of what has gone before.  What has the carpenter in view when he makes a shuttle?  Is it not something the nature of which is to weave?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>Certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Well, then, if the shuttle breaks while he making it,
<milestone n="389b" unit="section"/>will he make another with his mind fixed on that which is broken, or on that form with reference to which he was making the one which he broke?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>On that form, in my opinion.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then we should very properly call that the absolute or real shuttle?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>Yes, I think so.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then whenever he has to make a shuttle for a light or a thick garment, or for one of linen or of wool or of any kind whatsoever, all of them must contain the form or ideal of shuttle,
<milestone n="389c" unit="section"/>and in each of his products he must embody the nature which is naturally best for each?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And the same applies to all other instruments.  The artisan must discover the instrument naturally fitted for each purpose and must embody that in the material of which he makes the instrument, not in accordance with his own will, but in accordance with its nature.  He must, it appears, know how to embody in the iron the borer fitted by nature for each special use.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>Certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And he must embody in the wood the shuttle fitted by nature for each kind of weaving.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>True.
<milestone n="389d" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>For each kind of shuttle is, it appears, fitted by nature for its particular kind of weaving, and the like is true of other instruments.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then, my dear friend, must not the law-giver also know how to embody in the sounds and syllables that name which is fitted by nature for each object?  Must he not make and give all his names with his eye fixed upon the absolute or ideal name, if he is to be an authoritative giver of names?  And if different lawgivers do not embody it in the same syllables, we must not forget this ideal name on that account;  for different smiths do not embody the form in the same iron,
<milestone n="389e" unit="section"/>though making the same instrument for the same purpose, but so long as they reproduce the same ideal,
<milestone unit="page" n="390"/><milestone n="390a" unit="section"/>though it be in different iron, still the instrument is as it should be, whether it be made here or in foreign lands, is it not?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>Certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>On this basis, then, you will judge the law-giver, whether he be here or in a foreign land, so long as he gives to each thing the proper form of the name, in whatsoever syllables, to be no worse lawgiver, whether here or anywhere else, will you not?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>Certainly.
<milestone n="390b" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Now who is likely to know whether the proper form of shuttle is embodied in any piece of wood?  The carpenter who made it, or the weaver who is to use it ?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>Probably the one who is to use it, Socrates.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then who is to use the work of the lyre-maker?  Is not he the man who would know best how to superintend the making of the lyre and would also know whether it is well made or not when it is finished?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>Certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Who is he?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>The lyre-player.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And who would know best about the work of the ship-builder?
<milestone n="390c" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>The navigator.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And who can best superintend the work of the lawgiver and judge of it when it is finished, both here and in foreign countries?  The user, is it not?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And is not this he who knows how to ask questions?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>Certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And the same one knows also how to make replies?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And the man who knows how to ask and answer questions you call a dialectician?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>Yes, that is what I call him.
<milestone n="390d" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>The work of the carpenter, then, is to make a rudder under the supervision of the steersman, if he rudder is to be a good one.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>Evidently.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And the work of the lawgiver, as it seems, is to make a name, with the dialectician as his supervisor, if names are to be well given.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>True.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then, Hermogenes, the giving of names can hardly be, as you imagine, a trifling matter, or a task for trifling or casual persons:  and Cratylus is right in saying that names belong to things by nature
<milestone n="390e" unit="section"/>and that not every one is an artisan of names, but only he who keeps in view the name which belongs by nature to each particular thing and is able to embody its form in the letters and syllables.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>I do not know how to answer you, Socrates;  nevertheless it is not easy to change my conviction suddenly.
<milestone unit="page" n="391"/><milestone n="391a" unit="section"/>I think you would be more likely to convince me, if you were to show me just what it is that you say is the natural correctness of names.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>I, my dear Hermogenes, do not say that there is any.  You forget what I said a while ago, that I did not know, but would join you in looking for the truth.  And now, as we are looking, you and I, we already see one thing we did not know before, that names do possess a certain natural correctness, and that not every man knows
<milestone n="391b" unit="section"/>how to give a name well to anything whatsoever.  Is not that true?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>Certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then our next task is to try to find out, if you care to know about it, what kind of correctness that is which belongs to names.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>To be sure I care to know.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then investigate.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>How shall I investigate?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>The best way to investigate, my friend, is with the help of those who know;  and you make sure of their favour by paying them money.

<milestone n="392b" unit="section"/>But perhaps these matters are too high for us to understand;  it is, I think, more within human power to investigate the names Scamandrius and Astyanax, and understand what kind of correctness he ascribes to these, which he says are the names of Hector's son.  You recall, of course: the lines which contain the words to which I refer.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>Certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Which of the names of the boy do you imagine Homer thought was more correct, Astyanax or Scamandrius?
<milestone n="392c" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>I cannot say.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Look at it in this way:  suppose you were asked, &ldquo;Do the wise or the unwise give names more correctly?&rdquo;</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>&ldquo;The wise, obviously,&rdquo; I should say.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And do you think the women or the men of a city, regarded as a class in general, are the wiser?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>The men.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And do you not know that Homer says the child of Hector was called Astyanax by the men of <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>;<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb"><bibl n="Hom.

I do not yet understand about it myself, Hermogenes.  Do you?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>No, by Zeus, I do not.
<milestone unit="page" n="393"/><milestone n="393a" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>But, my good friend, did not Homer himself also give Hector his name?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>Why do you ask that?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Because that name seems to me similar to Astyanax, and both names seem to be Greek.  For lord (<foreign lang="greek">a)/nac</foreign>) and holder (<foreign lang="greek">e(/ktwr</foreign>) mean nearly the same thing, indicating that they are names of a king;  for surely a man is holder of that of which he is lord;  for it is clear that he rules it and possesses it and holds it.
<milestone n="393b" unit="section"/>Or does it seem to you that there is nothing in what I am saying, and am I wrong in imagining that I have found a clue to Homer's opinion about the correctness of names?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>No, by Zeus, you are not wrong, in my opinion;  I think perhaps you have found a clue.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>It is right, I think, to call a lion's offspring a lion and a horse's offspring a horse.  I am not speaking of prodigies, such as the birth of some other kind of creature from a horse,
<milestone n="393c" unit="section"/>but of the natural offspring of each species after its kind.  If a horse, contrary to nature, should bring forth a calf, the natural offspring of a cow, it should be called a calf, not a colt, nor if any offspring that is not human should be born from a human being, should that other offspring be called a human being;  and the same applies to trees and all the rest.  Do you not agree?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Good;  but keep watch of me, and do not let me trick you;  for by the same argument any offspring of a king should be called a king;
<milestone n="393d" unit="section"/>and whether the same meaning is expressed in one set of syllables or another makes no difference;  and if a letter is added or subtracted, that does not matter either, so long as the essence of the thing named remains in force and is made plain in the name.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>What do you mean?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Something quite simple.  For instance, when we speak of the letters of the alphabet, you know, we speak their names, not merely the letters themselves, except in the case of four, <foreign lang="greek">e, u, o, w</foreign>.<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">In Plato's time the names epsilon, ypsilon, omicron, and omega were not yet in vogue.  The names used were <foreign lang="greek">ei)=, u)=, ou)=,</foreign>and<foreign lang="greek">w)=</foreign>.</note>
<milestone n="393e" unit="section"/>We make names for all the other vowels and consonants by adding other letters to them;  and so long as we include the letter in question and make its force plain, we may properly call it by that name, and that will designate it for us.  Take beta, for instance, The addition of e(<foreign lang="greek">h</foreign>), t(<foreign lang="greek">t</foreign>), a(<foreign lang="greek">a</foreign>) does no harm and does not prevent the whole name from making clear the nature of that letter which the lawgiver wished to designate;  he knew so well how to give names to letters.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>I think you are right.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Does not the same reasoning apply to a king?
<milestone unit="page" n="394"/><milestone n="394a" unit="section"/>A king's son will probably be a king, a good man's good, a handsome man's handsome, and so forth;  the offspring of each class will be of the same class, unless some unnatural birth takes place;  so they should be called by the same names.  But variety in the syllables is admissible, so that names which are the same appear different to the uninitiated, just as the physicians' drugs, when prepared with various colors and perfumes, seem different to us, though they are the same, but to the physician,
<milestone n="394b" unit="section"/>who considers only their medicinal value, they seem the same, and he is not confused by the additions.  So perhaps the man who knows about names considers their value and is not confused if some letter is added, transposed, or subtracted, or even if the force of the name is expressed in entirely different letters.  So, for instance, in the names we were just discussing, Astyanax and Hector, none of the letters is the same, except T,
<milestone n="394c" unit="section"/>but nevertheless they have the same meaning.  And what letters has Archepolis (ruler of the city) in common with them?  Yet it means the same thing;  and there are many other names which mean simply &ldquo;king.&rdquo;  Others again mean &ldquo;general,&rdquo; such as Agis (leader), Polemarchus (war-lord), and Eupolemus (good warrior);  and others indicate physicians, as Iatrocles (famous physician) and  Acesimbrotus (healer of mortals);  and we might perhaps find many others which differ in syllables and letters, but express the same meaning.  Do you think that is true, or not?
<milestone n="394d" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>Certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>To those, then, who are born in accordance with nature the same names should be given.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And how about those who are born contrary to nature as prodigies?  For instance, when an  impious son is born to a good and pious man, ought he not, as in our former example when a mare brought forth a calf, to have the designation of the class to which he belongs, instead of that of his parent?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>Certainly.
<milestone n="394e" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then the impious son of a pious father ought to receive the name of his class.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>True.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Not Theophilus (beloved of God) or Mnesitheus (mindful of God) or anything of that sort;  but something of opposite meaning, if names are correct.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>Most assuredly, Socrates.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>As the name of Orestes (mountain man) is undoubtedly correct, Hermogenes, whether it was given him by chance or by some poet who indicated by the name the fierceness, rudeness, and mountain-wildness of his nature.
<milestone unit="page" n="395"/><milestone n="395a" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>So it seems, Socrates.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And his father's name also appears to be in accordance with nature.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>It seems so.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Yes, for Agamemnon (admirable for remaining) is one who would resolve to toil to the end and to endure, putting the finish upon his resolution by virtue.  And a proof of this is his long retention of the host at <placeName key="tgn,7014164">Troy</placeName> and his endurance.  So the name Agamemnon denotes that this man is admirable for remaining.
<milestone n="395b" unit="section"/>And so, too, the name of Atreus is likely to be correct;  for his murder of Chrysippus and the cruelty of his acts to Thyestes are all damaging and ruinous (<foreign lang="greek">a)thra/</foreign>) to his virtue.  Now the form of his name is slightly deflected and hidden, so that it does not make the man's nature plain to every one;  but to those who understand about names it makes the meaning of Atreus plain enough;  for indeed
<milestone n="395c" unit="section"/>in view of his stubbornness (<foreign lang="greek">a)teire/s</foreign>) and fearlessness (<foreign lang="greek">a)/treston</foreign>) and ruinous acts (<foreign lang="greek">a)thra/</foreign>) the name is correctly given to him on every ground.  And I think Pelops also has a fitting name;  for this name means that he who sees only what is near deserves this designation.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>How is that?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Why it is said of him that in murdering Myrtilus he was quite unable to forecast or foresee the ultimate effects upon his whole race, and all the misery with which it was overwhelmed,
<milestone n="395d" unit="section"/>because he saw only the near at hand and the immediate&mdash; that is to say, <foreign lang="greek">pe/las</foreign> (near)&mdash;in his eagerness to win by all means the hand of Hippodameia.  And any one would think the name of Tantalus was given rightly and in accordance with nature, if the stories about him are true.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>What are the stories?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>The many terrible misfortunes that happened to him both in his life, the last of which was the utter overthrow of his country, and in Hades, after his death,
<milestone n="395e" unit="section"/>the balancing (<foreign lang="greek">talantei/a</foreign>) of the stone above his head, in wonderful agreement with his name;  and it seems exactly as if someone who wished to call him most wretched (<foreign lang="greek">tala/ntaton</foreign>) disguised the name and said Tantalus instead;  in some such way as that chance seems to have affected his name in the legend.  And his father also, who is said to be Zeus, appears to have a very excellent name, but it is not easy to understand;
<milestone unit="page" n="396"/><milestone n="396a" unit="section"/>for the name of Zeus is exactly like a sentence;  we divide it into two parts, and some of us use one part, others the other;  for some call him <placeName key="tgn,2786838">Zena</placeName> (<foreign lang="greek">*zh=na</foreign>), and others Dia (<foreign lang="greek">*di/a</foreign>);  but the two in combination express the nature of the god, which is just what we said a name should be able to do.  For certainly no one is so much the author of life (<foreign lang="greek">zh=n</foreign>) for us and all others as the ruler and king of all.
<milestone n="396b" unit="section"/>Thus this god is correctly named, through whom (<foreign lang="greek">di' o(/n</foreign>) all living beings have the gift of life (<foreign lang="greek">zh=n</foreign>).  But, as I say, the name is divided, though it is one name, into the two parts, Dia and <placeName key="tgn,2786838">Zena</placeName>.  And it might seem, at first hearing, highly irreverent to call him the son of Cronus and reasonable to say that Zeus is the offspring of some great intellect;  and so he is, for <foreign lang="greek">ko/ros</foreign> (for <foreign lang="greek">*kro/nos</foreign>) signifies not child, but the purity (<foreign lang="greek">kaqaro/n</foreign>) and unblemished nature of his mind.  And Cronus, according to tradition, is the son of <placeName key="tgn,2741464">Uranus</placeName>;  but the upward gaze is rightly called by the name urania (<foreign lang="greek">ou)rani/a</foreign>),
<milestone n="396c" unit="section"/>looking at the things above (<foreign lang="greek">o(rw= ta\ a)/nw</foreign>), and the astronomers say, Hermogenes, that from this looking people acquire a pure mind, and <placeName key="tgn,2741464">Uranus</placeName> is correctly named.  If I remembered the genealogy of Hesiod and the still earlier ancestors of the gods he mentions, I would have gone on examining the correctness of their names until I had made a complete trial whether this wisdom which has suddenly come to me, I know not whence,
<milestone n="396d" unit="section"/>will fail or not.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>Indeed, Socrates, you do seem to me to be uttering oracles, exactly like an inspired prophet.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Yes, Hermogenes, and I am convinced that the inspiration came to me from Euthyphro the Prospaltian.  For I was with him and listening to him a long time early this morning.  So he must have been inspired, and he not only filled my ears but took possession of my soul with his superhuman wisdom.  So I think this is our duty:
<milestone n="396e" unit="section"/>we ought today to make use of this wisdom and finish the investigation of names, but tomorrow, if the rest of you agree, we will conjure it away and purify ourselves, when we have found some one, whether priest or sophist,
<milestone unit="page" n="397"/><milestone n="397a" unit="section"/>who is skilled in that kind of purifying.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>I agree, for I should be very glad to hear the rest of the talk about names.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Very well.  Then since we have outlined a general plan of investigation, where shall we begin, that we may discover whether the names themselves will bear witness that they are not at all distributed at haphazard, but have a certain correctness?
<milestone n="397b" unit="section"/>Now the names of heroes and men might perhaps prove deceptive;  for they are often given because they were names of ancestors, and in some cases, as we said in the beginning, they are quite inappropriate;  many, too, are given as the expression of a prayer, such as Eutychides (fortunate), Sosias (saviour), Theophilus (beloved of God), and many others.  I think we had better disregard such as these;  but we are most likely to find the correct names in the nature of the eternal and absolute;  for there the names ought to have been given with the greatest care,
<milestone n="397c" unit="section"/>and perhaps some of them were given by a power more divine than is that of men.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>I think you are right, Socrates.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then is it not proper to begin with the gods and see how the gods are rightly called by that name?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>That is reasonable.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Something of this sort, then, is what I suspect:  I think the earliest men in <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> believed only in those gods in whom many foreigners believe today&mdash;
<milestone n="397d" unit="section"/>sun, moon, earth, stars, and sky.  They saw that all these were always moving in their courses and running, and so they called them gods (<foreign lang="greek">qeou/s</foreign>) from this running (<foreign lang="greek">qei=n</foreign>) nature;  then afterwards, when they gained knowledge of the other gods, they called them all by the same name.  Is that likely to be true, or not?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>Yes, very likely.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>What shall we consider next?
<milestone n="397e" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>Spirits, obviously.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Hermogenes, what does the name &ldquo;spirits&rdquo; really mean?  See if you think there is anything in what I am going to say.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>Go on and say it.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Do you remember who Hesiod says the spirits are?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>I do not recall it.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Nor that he says a golden race was the first race of men to be born?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>Yes, I do know that.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Well, he says of it:<quote type="verse"><l met="dact">But since Fate has covered up this race,</l></quote>

WD 122 ff</bibl></cit></p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>What of that?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Why, I think he means that the golden race was not made of gold, but was good and beautiful.  And I regard it as a proof of this that he further says we are the iron race.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>True.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Don't you suppose that if anyone of our day is good,
<milestone n="398b" unit="section"/>Hesiod would say he was of that golden race?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>Quite likely.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>But the good are the wise, are they not?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>Yes, they are the wise.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>This, then, I think, is what he certainly means to say of the spirits:  because they were wise and knowing (<foreign lang="greek">dah/mones</foreign>) he called them spirits (<foreign lang="greek">dai/mones</foreign>) and in the old form of our language the two words are the same.  Now he and all the other poets are right, who say that when a good man dies
<milestone n="398c" unit="section"/>he has a great portion and honor among the dead, and becomes a spirit, a name which is in accordance with the other name of wisdom.  And so I assert that every good man, whether living or dead, is of spiritual nature, and is rightly called a spirit.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>And I, Socrates, believe I quite agree with you in that.  But what is the word &ldquo;hero&rdquo;?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>That is easy to understand;  for the name has been but slightly changed, and indicates their origin from love (<foreign lang="greek">e)/rws</foreign>).</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>What do you mean?
<milestone n="398d" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Why, they were all born because a god fell in love with a mortal woman, or a mortal man with a goddess.  Now if you consider the word &ldquo;hero&rdquo; also in the old Attic pronunciation,<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">The old Attic alphabet was officially given up in favour of the Ionic alphabet in 404 or 403 B.C.  The Attic for of the word &ldquo;hero&rdquo; is <foreign lang="greek">h(/ros</foreign>, that of &ldquo;Eros&rdquo; <foreign lang="greek">e)/rws</foreign>.  Plato seems to think there was a change in pronunciation, as well as in spelling, and indeed that is quite possible.  Or Plato may simply be confusing pronunciation with spelling, as he seems to do in several passages of this dialogue (cf. especially 410).</note> you will understand better;  for that will show you that it has been only slightly altered from the name of love (Eros), the source from which the heroes spring, to make a name for them.  And either this is the reason why they are called heroes, or it is because they were wise and clever orators and dialecticians, able to ask questions (<foreign lang="greek">e)rwta=n</foreign>), for <foreign lang="greek">ei)/rein</foreign> is the same as <foreign lang="greek">le/gein</foreign> (speak).  Therefore, when their name is spoken in the Attic dialect, which I was mentioning just now, the heroes turn out to be orators and askers of questions,
<milestone n="398e" unit="section"/>so that the heroic race proves to be a race of orators and sophists.  That is easy to understand, but the case of men, and the reason why they are called men (<foreign lang="greek">a)/nqrwpoi</foreign>), is more difficult. Can you tell me what it is?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>No, my friend, I cannot;  and even if I might perhaps find out, I shall not try, because I think you are more likely to find out than I am.
<milestone unit="page" n="399"/><milestone n="399a" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>You have faith in the inspiration of Euthyphro, it seems.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>Evidently.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And you are right in having it;  for just at this very moment I think I have had a clever thought, and if I am not careful, before the day is over I am likely to be wiser than I ought to be.  So pay attention.  First we must remember in regard to names that we often put in or take out letters, making the names different from the meaning we intend, and we change the accent.
<milestone n="399b" unit="section"/>Take, for instance, <foreign lang="greek">*dii\ fi/los</foreign>;  to change this from a phrase to a name, we took out the second iota and pronounced the middle syllable with the grave instead of the acute accent (Diphilus).  In other instances, on the contrary, we insert letters and pronounce grave accents as acute.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>True.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Now it appears to me that the name of men (<foreign lang="greek">a)/nqrwpos</foreign>) underwent a change of that sort.  It was a phrase, but became a noun when one letter, alpha, was removed and the accent of the last syllable was dropped.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>What do you mean?
<milestone n="399c" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>I will tell you.  The name &ldquo;man&rdquo; (<foreign lang="greek">a)/nqrwpos</foreign>) indicates that the other animals do not examine, or consider, or look up at (<foreign lang="greek">a)naqrei=</foreign>) any of the things that they see, but man has no sooner seen&mdash;that is, <foreign lang="greek">o)/pwpe</foreign>&mdash;than he looks up at and considers that which he has seen.  Therefore of all the animals man alone is rightly called man (<foreign lang="greek">a)/nqrwpos</foreign>), because he looks up at (<foreign lang="greek">a)naqrei=</foreign>) what he has seen (<foreign lang="greek">o)/pwpe</foreign>).</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>Of course.  May I ask you about the next word I should like to have explained?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Certainly.
<milestone n="399d" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>It seems to me to come naturally next after those you have discussed.  We speak of man's soul and body.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Yes, of course.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>Let us try to analyze these, as we did the previous words.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>You mean consider &ldquo;soul&rdquo; (<foreign lang="greek">yuxh/</foreign>) and see why it is properly called by that name, and likewise &ldquo;body&rdquo; (<foreign lang="greek">sw=ma</foreign>)?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>To speak on the spur of the moment, I think those who gave the soul its name had something of this sort in mind:  they thought when it was present in the body it was the cause of its living,

But&mdash;please keep still a moment.  I fancy I see something which will carry more conviction
<milestone unit="page" n="400"/><milestone n="400a" unit="section"/>to Euthyphro and his followers;  for I think they would despise this attempt and would consider it cheap talk.  Now see if you like the new one.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>I am listening.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Do you think there is anything which holds and carries the whole nature of the body, so that it lives and moves, except the soul?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>No;  nothing.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Well, and do you not believe the doctrine of Anaxagoras, that it is mind or soul which orders and holds the nature of all things?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>I do.
<milestone n="400b" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then there would be an admirable fitness in calling that power which carries and holds (<foreign lang="greek">e)/xei</foreign>) nature (<foreign lang="greek">fu/sin</foreign>) <foreign lang="greek">fuse/xh</foreign> and this may be refined and pronounced <foreign lang="greek">yuxh/</foreign>.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>Certainly;  and I think this is a more scientific explanation than the other.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Yes, it is.  But it seems actually absurd that the name was given with such truth.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>Now what shall we say about the next word?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>You mean &ldquo;body&rdquo; (<foreign lang="greek">sw=ma</foreign>)?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>I think this admits of many explanations, if a little, even very little, change is made;  for some say it is the tomb (<foreign lang="greek">sh=ma</foreign>) of the soul,
<milestone n="400c" unit="section"/>their notion being that the soul is buried in the present life;  and again, because by its means the soul gives any signs which it gives, it is for this reason also properly called &ldquo;sign&rdquo; (<foreign lang="greek">sh=ma</foreign>).  But I think it most likely that the Orphic poets gave this name, with the idea that the soul is undergoing punishment for something;  they think it has the body as an enclosure to keep it safe, like a prison, and this is, as the name itself denotes, the safe (<foreign lang="greek">sw=ma</foreign>) for the soul, until the penalty is paid, and not even a letter needs to be changed.
<milestone n="400d" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>I think, Socrates, enough has been said about these words;  but might we not consider the names of the gods in the same way in which you were speaking about that of Zeus a few minutes ago, and see what kind of correctness there is in them?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>By Zeus, Hermogenes, we, if we are sensible, must recognize that there is one most excellent kind, since of the gods we know nothing, neither of them nor of their names, whatever they may be, by which they call themselves, for it is clear that they use the true names.  But there is a second kind of correctness,
<milestone n="400e" unit="section"/>that we call them, as is customary in prayers, by whatever names and patronymics are pleasing to them, since we know no other.
<milestone unit="page" n="401"/><milestone n="401a" unit="section"/>Now I think that is an excellent custom.  So, if you like, let us first make a kind of announcement to the gods, saying that we are not going to investigate about them&mdash;for we do not claim to be able to do that&mdash;but about men, and let us inquire what thought men had in giving them their names;  for in that there is no impiety.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>I think, Socrates, you are right;  let us do as you say.
<milestone n="401b" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Shall we, then, begin with Hestia, according to custom?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>That is the proper thing.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then what would you say the man had in mind who gave Hestia her name?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>By Zeus, I think that is no more easy question than the other.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>At any rate, my dear Hermogenes, the first men who gave names were no ordinary persons, but high thinkers and great talkers.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>What then?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>I am sure the names were given by men of that kind;  and if foreign names are examined,
<milestone n="401c" unit="section"/>the meaning of each of them is equally evident.  Take, for instance, that which we call <foreign lang="greek">ou)si/a</foreign> (reality, essence);  some people call it <foreign lang="greek">e)ssi/a</foreign>, and still others <foreign lang="greek">w)si/a</foreign>.  First, then, in connection with the second of these forms, it is reasonable that the essence of things be called Hestia;  and moreover, because we ourselves say of that which partakes of reality &ldquo;it is&rdquo; (<foreign lang="greek">e)/stin</foreign>), the name Hestia would be correct in this connection also;  for apparently we also called <foreign lang="greek">ou)si/a</foreign> (reality) <foreign lang="greek">e)ssi/a</foreign> in ancient times.  And besides, if you consider it in connection with sacrifices,
<milestone n="401d" unit="section"/>you would come to the conclusion that those who established them understood the name in that way;  for those who called the essence of things <foreign lang="greek">e)ssi/a</foreign> would naturally sacrifice to Hestia first of all the gods.  Those on the other hand, who say <foreign lang="greek">w)si/a</foreign> would agree, well enough with Heracleitus that all things move and nothing remains still.  So they would say the cause and ruler of things was the pushing power (<foreign lang="greek">w)qou=n</foreign>), wherefore it had been rightly named <foreign lang="greek">w)si/a</foreign>.  But enough of this, considering that we know nothing.
<milestone n="401e" unit="section"/>After Hestia it is right to consider Rhea and Cronus.  The name of Cronus, however, has already been discussed.  But perhaps I am talking nonsense.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>Why, Socrates?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>My friend, I have thought of a swarm of wisdom.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>What is it?
<milestone unit="page" n="402"/><milestone n="402a" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>It sounds absurd, but I think there is some probability in it.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>What is this probability?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>I seem to have a vision of Heracleitus saying some ancient words of wisdom as old as the reign of Cronus and Rhea, which Homer said too.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>What do you mean by that?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Heracleitus says, you know, that all things move and nothing remains still, and he likens the universe to the current of a river, saying that you cannot step twice into the same stream.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>True.
    <milestone n="402b" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Well, don't you think he who gave to the ancestors of the other gods the names &ldquo;Rhea&rdquo; and &ldquo;Cronus&rdquo; had the same thought as Heracleitus?

Just so Homer, too, says&mdash;<quote type="verse"><l met="dactylic">Ocean the origin of the gods, and their mother Tethys;</l></quote><bibl n="Hom. Il. 14.201">Hom.

<milestone n="402d" unit="section"/>and filtered (<foreign lang="greek">h)qou/menon</foreign>) represents a spring, and the name Tethys is compounded of those two words.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>That is very neat, Socrates.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Of course it is.  But what comes next?  Zeus we discussed before.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Let us, then, speak of his brothers, Poseidon and <placeName key="tgn,2057261">Pluto</placeName>, including also the other name of the latter.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>By all means.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>I think Poseidon's name was given by him who first applied it,
<milestone n="402e" unit="section"/>because the power the sea restrained him as he was walking and hindered his advance;  it acted as a bond (<foreign lang="greek">desmo/s</foreign>) of his feet (<foreign lang="greek">podw=n</foreign>).  So he called the lord of this power Poseidon, regarding him as a foot-bond (<foreign lang="greek">posi/-desmon</foreign>). The e is inserted perhaps for euphony.  But possibly that may not be right;  possibly two lambdas were originally pronounced instead of the sigma, because the god knew (<foreign lang="greek">ei)do/tos</foreign>) many (<foreign lang="greek">polla/</foreign>) things.
<milestone unit="page" n="403"/><milestone n="403a" unit="section"/>Or it may be that from his shaking he was called the Shaker (<foreign lang="greek">o( sei/wn</foreign>), and the pi and delta are additions.  As for <placeName key="tgn,2119611">Pluto</placeName>, he was so named as the giver of wealth (<foreign lang="greek">plou=tos</foreign>), because wealth comes up from below out of the earth.  And Hades&mdash;I fancy most people think that this is a name of the Invisible (<foreign lang="greek">a)eidh/s</foreign>), so they are afraid and call him <placeName key="tgn,2119611">Pluto</placeName>.
<milestone n="403b" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>And what do you think yourself, Socrates?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>I think people have many false notions about the power of this god, and are unduly afraid of him.  They are afraid because when we are once dead we remain in his realm for ever, and they are also terrified because the soul goes to him without the covering of the body.  But I think all these facts, and the office and the name of the god, point in the same direction.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>How so?
<milestone n="403c" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>I will tell you my own view.  Please answer this question:  Which is the stronger bond upon any living being to keep him in any one place, desire, or compulsion?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>Desire, Socrates, is much stronger.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then do you not believe there would be many fugitives from Hades, if he did not bind with the strongest bond those who go to him there?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>Of course there would.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Apparently, then, if he binds them with the strongest bond, he binds them by some kind of desire, not by compulsion.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>Yes, that is plain.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>There are many desires, are there not?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>Yes.
<milestone n="403d" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then he binds with the desire which is the strongest of all, if he is to restrain them with the strongest bond.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And is there any desire stronger than the thought of being made a better man by association with some one?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>No, by Zeus, Socrates, there certainly is not.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then, Hermogenes, we must believe that this is the reason why no one has been willing to come away from that other world, not even the Sirens, but they and all others have been overcome by his enchantments,
<milestone n="403e" unit="section"/>so beautiful, as it appears, are the words which Hades has the power to speak;  and from this point of view this god is a perfect sophist and a great benefactor of those in his realm, he who also bestows such great blessings upon us who are on earth;  such abundance surrounds him there below, and for this reason he is called <placeName key="tgn,2119611">Pluto</placeName>.  Then, too, he refuses to consort with men while they have bodies, but only accepts their society
<milestone unit="page" n="404"/><milestone n="404a" unit="section"/>when the soul is pure of all the evils and desires of the body.  Do you not think this shows him to be a philosopher and to understand perfectly that under these conditions he could restrain them by binding them with the desire of virtue, but that so long as they are infected with the unrest and madness of the body, not even his father Cronus could hold them to himself, though he bound them with his famous chains?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>There seems to be something in that, Socrates.
<milestone n="404b" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And the name &ldquo;Hades&rdquo; is not in the least derived from the invisible (<foreign lang="greek">a)eide/s</foreign>), but far more probably from knowing (<foreign lang="greek">ei)de/nai</foreign>) all noble things, and for that reason he was called Hades by the lawgiver.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>Very well;  what shall we say of Demeter, Hera, Apollo, Athena, Hephaestus, Ares, and the other gods</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Demeter appears to have been called Demeter, because like a mother (<foreign lang="greek">mh/thr</foreign>) she gives the gift of food,
<milestone n="404c" unit="section"/>and Hera is a lovely one (<foreign lang="greek">e)rath/</foreign>), as indeed, Zeus is said to have married her for love.  But perhaps the lawgiver had natural phenomena in mind, and called her Hera (<foreign lang="greek">*(/hra</foreign>) as a disguise for <foreign lang="greek">a)h/r</foreign> (air), putting the beginning at the end.  You would understand, if you were to repeat the name Hera over and over.  And Pherephatta!&mdash;How many people fear this name, and also Apollo!  I imagine it is because they do not know about correctness of names.  You see they change the name to Phersephone and its aspect frightens them.  But really the name indicates that the goddess is wise;
<milestone n="404d" unit="section"/>for since things are in motion (<foreign lang="greek">fero/mena</foreign>), that which grasps (<foreign lang="greek">e)fapto/menon</foreign>) and touches (<foreign lang="greek">e)pafw=n</foreign>) and is able to follow them is wisdom.  Pherepapha, or something of that sort, would therefore be the correct name of the goddess, because she is wise and touches that which is in motion (<foreign lang="greek">e)pafh\ tou= ferome/nou</foreign>)&mdash;and this is the reason why Hades, who is wise, consorts with her, because she is wise&mdash;but people have altered her name, attaching more importance to euphony than to truth, and they call her Pherephatta.  Likewise in the case of Apollo,
<milestone n="404e" unit="section"/>as I say, many people are afraid because of the name of the god, thinking that it has some terrible meaning.  Have you not noticed that?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>Certainly;  what you say is true.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>But really the name is admirably appropriate to the power of the god.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>How is that?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>I will try to tell you what I think about it;
<milestone unit="page" n="405"/><milestone n="405a" unit="section"/>for no single name could more aptly indicate the four functions of the god, touching upon them all and in a manner declaring his power in music, prophecy, medicine, and archery.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>Go on;  you seem to imply that it is a remarkable name.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>His name and nature are in harmony;  you see he is a musical god.  For in the first place, purification and purgations used in medicine and in soothsaying, and fumigations with medicinal and magic drugs,
<milestone n="405b" unit="section"/>and the baths and sprinklings connected with that sort of thing all have the single function of making a man pure in body and soul, do they not?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>Certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>But this is the god who purifies and washes away (<foreign lang="greek">a)paloou/wn</foreign>) and delivers (<foreign lang="greek">a)polu/wn</foreign>) from such evils, is he not?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>Certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>With reference, then, to his acts of delivering and his washings,
<milestone n="405c" unit="section"/>as being the physician of such diseases, he might properly be called Apoluon (<foreign lang="greek">a)palou/wn</foreign>, the washer), and with reference to soothsaying and truth and simplicity&mdash;for the two are identical&mdash;he might most properly be called by the name the Thessalians use;  for all Thessalians call the god Aplun.  And because he is always by his archery controller of darts (<foreign lang="greek">bolw=n</foreign>) he is ever darting (<foreign lang="greek">a)ei\ ba/llwn</foreign>).  And with reference to music we have to understand that <term>alpha</term> often signifies &ldquo;together,&rdquo; and here it denotes moving together in the heavens about the poles, as we call them, and harmony in song,
<milestone n="405d" unit="section"/>which is called concord;  for, as the ingenious musicians and astronomers tell us, all these things move together by a kind of harmony.  And this god directs the harmony, making them all move together, among both gods and men;  and so, just as we call the <foreign lang="greek">o(moke/leuqon</foreign> (him who accompanies), and <foreign lang="greek">o(mo/koitin</foreign> (bedfellow), by changing the <foreign lang="greek">o(mo</foreign> to alpha, <foreign lang="greek">a)ko/louqon</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">a)/koitin</foreign>, so also we called him Apollo who was Homopolo,
<milestone n="405e" unit="section"/>and the second lambda was inserted, because without it the name sounded of disaster (<foreign lang="greek">a)polw=, a)po/lwla</foreign>, etc.).  Even as it is, some have a suspicion of this, because they do not properly regard the force of the name, and therefore they fear it, thinking that it denotes some kind of ruin.  But in fact, as was said,
<milestone unit="page" n="406"/><milestone n="406a" unit="section"/>the name touches upon all the qualities of the god, as simple, ever-darting, purifying, and accompanying. The Muses and music in general are named, apparently, from <foreign lang="greek">mw=sqai</foreign>, searching, and philosophy;  and Leto from her gentleness, because whatever is asked of her, she is willing (<foreign lang="greek">e)qelh/mwn</foreign>).  But perhaps her name is Letho, as she is called by many foreigners;  and those who call her by that name seem to do so
<milestone n="406b" unit="section"/>on account of the mild and gentle (<foreign lang="greek">lei=on, *lhqw/</foreign>) kindness of her character.  Artemis appears to get her name from her healthy (<foreign lang="greek">a)rteme/s</foreign>) and well-ordered nature, and her love of virginity;  or perhaps he who named her meant that she is learned in virtue (<foreign lang="greek">a)reth/</foreign>), or possibly, too, that she hates sexual intercourse (<foreign lang="greek">a)/roton misei=</foreign>) of man and woman;  or he who gave the goddess her name may have given it for any or all of these reasons.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>What of Dionysus and Aphrodite?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>You ask great things of me, son of Hipponicus.  You see there is both a serious and a facetious account of the form
<milestone n="406c" unit="section"/>of the name of these deities.  You will have to ask others for the serious one;  but there is nothing to hinder my giving you the facetious account, for the gods also have a sense of humor.  Dionysus, the giver (<foreign lang="greek">didou/s</foreign>) of wine (<foreign lang="greek">oi)=nos</foreign>), might be called in jest Didoinysus, and wine, because it makes most drinkers think (<foreign lang="greek">oi)/esqai</foreign>) they have wit (<foreign lang="greek">nou=s</foreign>) when they have not, might very justly be called Oeonus (<foreign lang="greek">oi)o/nous</foreign>).  As for Aphrodite, we need not oppose Hesiod;  we can accept his derivation of the name
<milestone n="406d" unit="section"/>from her birth out of the foam (<foreign lang="greek">a)frou=</foreign>).</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>But surely you, as an Athenian, will not forget Athena, nor Hephaestus and Ares.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>That is not likely.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>No.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>It is easy to tell the reason of one of her two names.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>What name?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>We call her <placeName key="tgn,2565867">Pallas</placeName>, you know.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>Yes, of course.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Those of us are right, I fancy,
<milestone n="406e" unit="section"/>who think this name is derived from armed dances, for lifting oneself or anything else from the ground or
<milestone unit="page" n="407"/><milestone n="407a" unit="section"/>in the hands is called shaking (<foreign lang="greek">pa/llein</foreign>) and being shaken, or dancing and being danced.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>Yes, certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>So that is the reason she is called <placeName key="tgn,2565867">Pallas</placeName>.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>And rightly called so.

The ancients seem to have had the same belief about Athena as the interpreters of Homer have now;
<milestone n="407b" unit="section"/>for most of these, in commenting on the poet, say that he represents Athena as mind (<foreign lang="greek">nou=s</foreign>) and intellect (<foreign lang="greek">dia/noia</foreign>);  and the maker of her name seems to have had a similar conception of her, but he gives her the still grander title of &ldquo;mind of God&rdquo; <foreign lang="greek">h( qeou= no/hsis</foreign>, seeming to say that she is a <foreign lang="greek">a( qeono/a</foreign>;  here he used the alpha in foreign fashion instead of eta, and dropped out the iota and sigma.  But perhaps that was not his reason;  he may have called her Theonoe because she has unequalled knowledge of divine things (<foreign lang="greek">ta\ qei=a noou=sa</foreign>).  Perhaps, too, he may have wished to identify the goddess with wisdom of character (<foreign lang="greek">e)n h)/qei no/hsis</foreign>)
<milestone n="407c" unit="section"/>by calling her Ethonoe;  and then he himself or others afterwards improved the name, as they thought, and called her Athenaa.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>And how do you explain Hephaestus?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>You ask about &ldquo;the noble master of light&rdquo;?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>To be sure.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Hephaestus is <placeName key="tgn,7010788">Phaestus</placeName>, with the eta added by attraction;  anyone could see that, I should think.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>Very likely, unless some other explanation occurs to you, as it probably will.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>To prevent that, ask about Ares.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>I do ask.

<milestone unit="page" n="410"/><milestone n="410a" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Well, this word <foreign lang="greek">pu=r</foreign> is probably foreign;  for it is difficult to connect it with the Greek language, and besides, the Phrygians have the same word, only slightly altered.

<milestone n="410b" unit="section"/>But is air called <foreign lang="greek">a)h/r</foreign> because it raises (<foreign lang="greek">ai)/rei</foreign>) things from the earth, or because it is always flowing (<foreign lang="greek">a)ei\ r(ei=</foreign>), or because wind arises from its flow?  The poets call the winds <foreign lang="greek">a)h/tas</foreign>, &ldquo;blasts.&rdquo;  Perhaps the poet means to say &ldquo;air-flow&rdquo; (<foreign lang="greek">a)hto/rroun</foreign>), as he might say &ldquo;wind-flow&rdquo; (<foreign lang="greek">pneumato/rroun</foreign>).  The word <foreign lang="greek">ai)/qhr</foreign> (ether) I understand in this way: because it always runs and flows about the air (<foreign lang="greek">a)ei\ qei= peri\ to\n a)e/ra r(e/on</foreign>), it may properly be called <foreign lang="greek">a)eiqeh/ra</foreign>.  The word <foreign lang="greek">gh=</foreign> (earth) shows the meaning better
<milestone n="410c" unit="section"/>in the form <foreign lang="greek">gai=a</foreign>;  for <foreign lang="greek">gai=a</foreign> is a correct word for &ldquo;mother,&rdquo; as Homer says, for he uses <foreign lang="greek">gega/asin</foreign> to mean <foreign lang="greek">gegenh=sqai</foreign> (be born).  Well, now what came next?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>The seasons, Socrates, and the two words for year.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>The word <foreign lang="greek">w(=rai</foreign> (seasons) should be pronounced in the old Attic fashion, <foreign lang="greek">o(/rai</foreign>, if you wish to know the probable meaning;  <foreign lang="greek">*h*o*r*a*i</foreign> exist to divide winters and summers and winds and the fruits of the earth;  and since they divide (<foreign lang="greek">o(ri/zousi</foreign>), they would rightly be called <foreign lang="greek">o(/rai</foreign>.
<milestone n="410d" unit="section"/>The two words for year, <foreign lang="greek">e)niauto/s</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">e)/tos</foreign>, are really one.

The whole phrase is &ldquo;that which examines within itself&rdquo; (<foreign lang="greek">to\ e)n a(utw=| e)ta/zon</foreign>), and this one phrase is divided in speech so that the two words <foreign lang="greek">e)niauto/s</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">e)/tos</foreign>

<milestone unit="page" n="411"/><milestone n="411a" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>Now after the class of words you, have explained, I should like to examine the correctness of the noble words that relate to virtue, such as wisdom, intelligence, justice, and all the others of that sort.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>You are stirring up a mighty tribe of words, my friend;  however, since I have put on the lion helmet, I must not play the coward, but must, it seems, examine wisdom, intelligence, thought, knowledge,
<milestone n="411b" unit="section"/>and all the other noble words of which you speak.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>Certainly we must not stop until that is done.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>By dog, I believe I have a fine intuition which has just come to me, that the very ancient men who invented names were quite like most of the present philosophers who always get dizzy as they turn round and round in their search for the nature of things, and then the things seem to them to turn round and round and be in motion.
<milestone n="411c" unit="section"/>They think the cause of this belief is not an affection within themselves, but that the nature of things really is such that nothing is at rest or stable, but everything is flowing and moving and always full of constant motion and generation.  I say this because I thought of it with reference to all these words we are now considering.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>How is that, Socrates?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Perhaps you did not observe that the names we just mentioned are given under the assumption that the things named are moving and flowing and being generated.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>No, I did not notice that at all.
<milestone n="411d" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Surely the first one we mentioned is subject to such assumptions.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>What is the word ?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Wisdom (<foreign lang="greek">fro/nhsis</foreign>);  for it is perception (<foreign lang="greek">no/hsis</foreign>) of motion (<foreign lang="greek">fora=s</foreign>) and flowing (<foreign lang="greek">r(ou=</foreign>);  or it might be understood as benefit (<foreign lang="greek">o)/nhsis</foreign>) of motion (<foreign lang="greek">fora=s</foreign>);  in either case it has to do with motion.  And <foreign lang="greek">gnw/mh</foreign> (thought), if you please, certainly denotes contemplation and consideration of generation (<foreign lang="greek">gonh=s nw/mhsis</foreign>);  for to consider is the same as to contemplate.  Or, if you please, <foreign lang="greek">no/hsis</foreign> (intelligence) is merely <foreign lang="greek">e(/sis</foreign> (desire) <foreign lang="greek">tou= neou=</foreign> (of the new);  but that things are new shows that they are always being generated;
<milestone n="411e" unit="section"/>therefore the soul's desire for generation is declared by the giver of the name <foreign lang="greek">neo/esis</foreign>;  for in antiquity the name was not <foreign lang="greek">no/hsis</foreign>, but two epsilons had to be spoken instead of the eta.  <foreign lang="greek">*swfrosu/nh</foreign> (self-restraint) is <foreign lang="greek">swthri/a</foreign> (salvation) of <foreign lang="greek">fro/nhsis</foreign> (wisdom), which we have just been discussing.
<milestone unit="page" n="412"/><milestone n="412a" unit="section"/>And <foreign lang="greek">e)pisth/mh</foreign> (knowledge) indicates that the soul which is of any account accompanies (<foreign lang="greek">e(/petai</foreign>) things in their motion, neither falling behind them nor running in front of them;  therefore we ought to insert an epsilon and call it <foreign lang="greek">e)pei+sth/mh</foreign>.  <foreign lang="greek">*su/nesis</foreign> (intelligence) in its turn is a kind of reckoning together;  when one says <foreign lang="greek">sunie/nai</foreign> (understand), the same thing as <foreign lang="greek">e)pi/stasqai</foreign> is said;
<milestone n="412b" unit="section"/>for <foreign lang="greek">sunie/nai</foreign> means that the soul goes with things.  Certainly <foreign lang="greek">sofi/a</foreign> (wisdom) denotes the touching of motion.  This word is very obscure and of foreign origin;  but we must remember that the poets often say of something which begins to advance <foreign lang="greek">e)su/qh</foreign> (it rushed).  There was a famous Laconian whose name was <foreign lang="greek">*sou=s</foreign> (Rush), for this is the Laconian word for rapid motion.  Now <foreign lang="greek">sofi/a</foreign> signifies the touching (<foreign lang="greek">e)pafh/</foreign>) of this rapid motion, the assumption being that things are in motion.  And the word <foreign lang="greek">a)gaqo/n</foreign> (good)
<milestone n="412c" unit="section"/>is intended to denote the admirable (<foreign lang="greek">a)gasto/n</foreign>) in all nature.  For since all things are in motion, they possess quickness and slowness;  now not all that is swift, but only part of it, is admirable;  this name <foreign lang="greek">a)gaqo/n</foreign> is therefore given to the admirable (<foreign lang="greek">a)gasto/n</foreign>) part of the swift (<foreign lang="greek">qoou=</foreign>).<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>It is easy to conjecture that the word <foreign lang="greek">dikaiasu/nh</foreign> applies to the understanding (<foreign lang="greek">su/nesis</foreign>) of the just (<foreign lang="greek">tou= diai/on</foreign>) but the word <foreign lang="greek">di/kaion</foreign> (just) is itself difficult.  Up to a certain point, you see, many men seem to agree about it, but beyond that they differ.
<milestone n="412d" unit="section"/>For those who think the universe is in motion believe that the greater part of it is of such a nature as to be a mere receptacle, and that there is some element which passes through all this, by means of which all created things are generated.  And this element must be very rapid and very subtle;  for it could not pass through all the universe unless it were very subtle, so that nothing could keep it out, and it must be very swift, so that all other things are relatively at rest.  Since, then, it superintends and passes through (<foreign lang="greek">diai+o/n</foreign>) all other things,
<milestone n="412e" unit="section"/>this is rightly called by the name <foreign lang="greek">di/kaion</foreign>, the sound of the kappa being added merely for the sake of euphony.  Up to this point, as I said just now, many men agree about justice (<foreign lang="greek">di/kaion</foreign>);
<milestone unit="page" n="413"/><milestone n="413a" unit="section"/>and I, Hermogenes, being very much in earnest about it, have persistently asked questions and have been told in secret teachings that this is justice, or the cause&mdash;for that through which creation takes place is a cause&mdash;and some one told me that it was for this reason rightly called Zeus (<foreign lang="greek">*di/a</foreign>).  But when, after hearing this, I nevertheless ask them quietly, &ldquo;What then, my most excellent friend, if this is true, is justice?&rdquo; they think I am asking too many questions and am leaping over the trenches.<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">A trench was the limit of the leap for the pentathletes.</note>
<milestone n="413b" unit="section"/>They say I have been told enough;  they try to satisfy me by saying all sorts of different things, and they no longer agree.  For one says the sun is justice, for the sun alone superintends all things, passing through and burning (<foreign lang="greek">diai+o/nta kai\ kai/onta</foreign>) them.  Then when I am pleased and tell this to some one, thinking it is a fine answer, he laughs at me and asks if I think there is no justice among men when the sun has set.  So I beg him to tell me what he thinks it is,
<milestone n="413c" unit="section"/>and he says &ldquo;Fire.&rdquo;  But this is not easy to understand.  He says it is not actual fire, but heat in the abstract that is in the fire.  Another man says he laughs at all these notions, and that justice is what Anaxagoras says it is, mind;  for mind, he says, is ruled only by itself, is mixed with nothing, orders all things, and passes through them.  Then, my friend, I am far more perplexed than before I undertook to learn about the nature of justice.
<milestone n="413d" unit="section"/>But I think the name&mdash;and that was the subject of our investigation&mdash;was given for the reasons I have mentioned.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>I think, Socrates, you must have heard this from some one and are not inventing it yourself.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And how about the rest of my talk?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>I do not at all think you had heard that.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Listen then;  perhaps I may deceive you into thinking that all I am going to say is my own. What remains to consider after justice?  I think we have not yet discussed courage.
<milestone n="413e" unit="section"/>It is plain enough that injustice (<foreign lang="greek">a)diki/a</foreign>) is really a mere hindrance of that which passes through (<foreign lang="greek">tou= diai+o/ntos</foreign>, but the word <foreign lang="greek">a)drei/a</foreign> (courage) implies that courage got its name in battle, and if the universe is flowing, a battle in the universe can be nothing else than an opposite current or flow (<foreign lang="greek">r(oh/</foreign>).  Now if we remove the delta from the word <foreign lang="greek">a)ndrei/a</foreign>, the word <foreign lang="greek">a)nrei/a</foreign> signifies exactly that activity.  Of course it is clear that not the current opposed to every current is courage, but only that opposed to the current which is contrary to justice;
<milestone unit="page" n="414"/><milestone n="414a" unit="section"/>for otherwise courage would not be praised.  The words <foreign lang="greek">a)/rren</foreign> (male) and <foreign lang="greek">a)nh/r</foreign> (man) refer, like <foreign lang="greek">a)ndrei/a</foreign>, to the upward (<foreign lang="greek">a)/nw</foreign>) current or flow.  The word <foreign lang="greek">gunh/</foreign> (woman) seems to me to be much the same as <foreign lang="greek">gonh/</foreign> (birth).  I think <foreign lang="greek">qh=lu</foreign> (female) is derived from <foreign lang="greek">qhlh/</foreign> (teat);  and is not <foreign lang="greek">qhlh/</foreign>, Hermogenes, so called because it makes things flourish (<foreign lang="greek">teqhle/nai</foreign>), like plants wet with showers?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>Very likely, Socrates.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And again, the word <foreign lang="greek">qa/llein</foreign> (flourish) seems to me to figure the rapid and sudden growth of the young.
<milestone n="414b" unit="section"/>Something of that sort the namegiver has reproduced in the name, which he compounded of <foreign lang="greek">qei=n</foreign> (run) and <foreign lang="greek">a(/llesqai</foreign> (jump).  You do not seem to notice how I rush along outside of the race-course, when I get on smooth ground.  But we still have plenty of subjects left which seem to be serious.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>True.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>One of which is to see what the word <foreign lang="greek">te/xnh</foreign> (art, science) means.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>Certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Does not this denote possession of mind, if you remove the tau and insert omicron between the chi and the nu
<milestone n="414c" unit="section"/>and the nu and the eta (making <foreign lang="greek">e)xono/h</foreign>)?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>It does it very poorly, Socrates.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>My friend, you do not bear in mind that the original words have before now been completely buried by those who wished to dress them up, for they have added and subtracted letters for the sake of euphony and have distorted the words in every way for ornamentation or merely in the lapse of time.  Do you not, for instance, think it absurd that the letter rho is inserted in the word <foreign lang="greek">ka/aptron</foreign> (mirror)?
<milestone n="414d" unit="section"/>I think that sort of thing is the work of people who care nothing for truth, but only for the shape of their mouths;  so they keep adding to the original words until finally no human being can understand what in the world the word means.  So the sphinx, for instance, is called sphinx, instead of phix, and there are many other examples.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>Yes, that is true, Socrates.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And if we are permitted to insert and remove any letters we please in words, it will be perfectly easy to fit any name to anything.
<milestone n="414e" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>True.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Yes, quite true.  But I think you, as a wise director, must observe the rule of moderation and probability.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>I should like to do so.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And I, too, Hermogenes.
<milestone unit="page" n="415"/><milestone n="415a" unit="section"/>But do not, my friend, demand too much precision, lest you 
    <quote type="Verse">&ldquo;enfeeble me of my sight.&rdquo;</quote><bibl n="Hom. Il. 6.265">Hom. Il. 6.265</bibl> For now that <foreign lang="greek">te/xnh</foreign> (art) is disposed of, I am nearing the loftiest height of my subject, when once we have investigated <foreign lang="greek">mhxanh/</foreign>(contrivance).  For I think <foreign lang="greek">mhxanh/</foreign> signifies <foreign lang="greek">a)/nein e)pi\ polu/</foreign> (much accomplishment);  for <foreign lang="greek">mh=kos</foreign> (length) has about the same meaning as <foreign lang="greek">to\ polu/</foreign> (much), and the name <foreign lang="greek">mhxanh/</foreign> is composed of these two, <foreign lang="greek">mh=kos</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">a)/nein</foreign>.  But, as I was just saying, we must go on to the loftiest height of our subject;  we must search for the meaning of the words <foreign lang="greek">a)reth/</foreign> (virtue) and <foreign lang="greek">kaki/a</foreign> (wickedness).  Now one of them I cannot yet see;
<milestone n="415b" unit="section"/>but the other seems to be quite clear, since it agrees with everything we have said before.  For inasmuch as all things are in motion, everything that moves badly (<foreign lang="greek">kakw=s i)o/n</foreign>) would be evil (<foreign lang="greek">kaki/a</foreign>);  and when this evil motion in relation to its environment exists in the soul, it receives the general name <foreign lang="greek">kaki/a</foreign> (evil) in the special sense of wickedness.  But the nature of evil motion (<foreign lang="greek">kakw=s i)e/nai</foreign>) is made clear, I think, also in the word <foreign lang="greek">deili/a</foreign> (cowardice), which we have not yet discussed.  We passed it by,
<milestone n="415c" unit="section"/>when we ought to have examined it after <foreign lang="greek">a)ndrei/a</foreign> (courage);  and I fancy we passed over a good many other words.  Now the meaning of <foreign lang="greek">deili/a</foreign> is &ldquo;a strong bond of the soul&rdquo;;  for <foreign lang="greek">li/an</foreign> (excessively) is, in a way, expressive of strength;  so <foreign lang="greek">deili/a</foreign> would be the excessive or greatest bond (<foreign lang="greek">desmo/s, dei=n</foreign>) of the soul;  and so, too, <foreign lang="greek">a)pori/a</foreign> (perplexity) is an evil, as is everything, apparently, which hinders motion and progress (<foreign lang="greek">poreu/esqai</foreign>).  This, then, seems to be the meaning of evil motion (<foreign lang="greek">kakw=s i)e/nai</foreign>), that advance is halting and impeded;  and the soul that is infected by it becomes filled with wickedness (<foreign lang="greek">kaki/a</foreign>).  If these are the reasons for the name of wickedness, virtue (<foreign lang="greek">a)reth/</foreign>) would be the opposite of this;  it would signify first ease of motion,
<milestone n="415d" unit="section"/>and secondly that the flow of the good soul is always unimpeded, and therefore it has received this name, which designates that which always flows (<foreign lang="greek">a)ei\ r(e/on</foreign>) without let or hindrance.  It is properly called <foreign lang="greek">a)eireith/</foreign>, or perhaps also <foreign lang="greek">ai(reth/</foreign>, indicating that this condition is especially to be chosen;  but it has been compressed and is pronounced <foreign lang="greek">a)reth/</foreign>.  Perhaps you will say this is another invention of mine;  but I say if what I said just now about <foreign lang="greek">kaki/a</foreign> is right,
<milestone n="415e" unit="section"/>this about the name of <foreign lang="greek">a)reth/</foreign> is right too.

For the giver of names appears to me throughout to denounce that which hinders and restrains things from flowing, and in this instance he gave to that which always restrains the flow (<foreign lang="greek">a)ei\ i)/sxei to\n r(ou=n</foreign>) this name <foreign lang="greek">a)eisxorou=n</foreign>, which is now compressed and pronounced <foreign lang="greek">ai)sxro/n</foreign>.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>What about <foreign lang="greek">kalo/n</foreign>?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>That is harder to understand, and yet it expresses its meaning:  it has been altered merely in accent and in the length of the O.
<milestone n="416c" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>How is that?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>I think this word denotes intellect.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>What do you mean?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Why, what do you think is the cause why anything is called by a name?  Is it not the power which gave the name?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>Why, certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And is not that power the intellect either of gods or of men or both?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Are not that which called things by name and that which calls them by name (<foreign lang="greek">to\ kalou=n</foreign>) the same thing, namely intellect?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>Yes, clearly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And are not all works which are done by mind and intelligence worthy of praise, and those that are not done by them worthy of blame?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>Certainly.
<milestone n="416d" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Does not the medical power perform medical works and the power of carpentry works of carpentry?  Do you agree to that?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>I agree.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And the beautiful performs beautiful works?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>It must do so.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And the beautiful is, we say, intellect?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>Certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then this name, the beautiful, is rightly given to mind, since it accomplishes the works which we call beautiful and in which we delight.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>Evidently.
<milestone n="416e" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>What further words of this sort are left for us?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>Those that are related to the good and the beautiful,
<milestone unit="page" n="417"/><milestone n="417a" unit="section"/>such as <foreign lang="greek">sumfe/ronta</foreign> (advantageous), <foreign lang="greek">lusitelou=nta</foreign> (profitable), <foreign lang="greek">w)fe/lima</foreign> (useful), <foreign lang="greek">kerdale/a</foreign> (gainful), and their opposites.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>You might by this time be able to find the meaning of <foreign lang="greek">sumfe/ronta</foreign> by yourself in the light of the previous explanations, for it appears to be own brother to <foreign lang="greek">e)pisth/mh</foreign>.  It means nothing else but the motion (<foreign lang="greek">fora/</foreign>) of the soul in company with the world, and naturally things which are done by such a power are called <foreign lang="greek">sumfe/ronta</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">su/mfora</foreign> because they are carried round with (<foreign lang="greek">sumperife/resqai</foreign>) the world.  But <foreign lang="greek">kerdale/on</foreign> is from <foreign lang="greek">ke/rdos</foreign> (gain).
<milestone n="417b" unit="section"/>If you restore nu in the word <foreign lang="greek">ke/rdos</foreign> in place of the delta, the meaning is plain;  it signifies good, but in another way.  Because it passes through and is mingled (<foreign lang="greek">kera/nnutai</foreign>) with all things, he who named it gave it this name which indicates that function;  but he inserted a delta instead of nu and said <foreign lang="greek">ke/rdos</foreign>.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>And what is <foreign lang="greek">lusitelou=n</foreign>?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>I do not think, Hermogenes, the name-giver gives the meaning to <foreign lang="greek">lusitelou=n</foreign> which it has in the language of tradesfolk, when profit sets free (<foreign lang="greek">a)polu/ei</foreign>) the sum invested,
<milestone n="417c" unit="section"/>but he means that because it is the swiftest thing in the world it does not allow things to remain at rest and does not allow the motion to come to any end (<foreign lang="greek">te/los</foreign>) of movement or to stop or pause, but always, if any end of the motion is attempted, it sets it free, making it unceasing and immortal.  It is in this sense, I think, that the good is dubbed <foreign lang="greek">lusitelou=n</foreign>, for it frees (<foreign lang="greek">lu/ei</foreign>) the end (<foreign lang="greek">te/los</foreign>) of the motion.  But the word <foreign lang="greek">w)fe/limon</foreign> is a foreign one, which Homer often uses in the verbal form <foreign lang="greek">o)fe/llein</foreign>.  This is a synonym of &ldquo;increase&rdquo; and &ldquo;create.&rdquo;

<milestone n="417e" unit="section"/>but <foreign lang="greek">bla/pton</foreign> means &ldquo;wishing to fasten&rdquo; (<foreign lang="greek">a(/ptein</foreign>), and <foreign lang="greek">a(/ptein</foreign> is the same thing as <foreign lang="greek">dei=n</foreign> (bind), which the name-giver constantly finds fault with.  Now <foreign lang="greek">to\ boulo/menon a(/ptein r(ou=n</foreign> (that which wishes to fasten the flow) would most correctly be called <foreign lang="greek">boulapterou=n</foreign>, but is called <foreign lang="greek">blabero/n</foreign> merely, as I think, to make it prettier.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>Elaborate names these are, Socrates, that result from your method.  Just now,
<milestone unit="page" n="418"/><milestone n="418a" unit="section"/>when you pronounced <foreign lang="greek">boulapterou=n</foreign>, you looked as if you had made up your mouth to whistle the flute-prelude of the hymn to Athena.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Not I, Hermogenes, am responsible, but those who gave the name.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>True.  Well, what is the origin of <foreign lang="greek">zhmiw=des</foreign>?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>What can the origin of <foreign lang="greek">zhmiw=des</foreign> be?  See, Hermogenes, how true my words are when I say that by adding and taking away letters people alter the sense of words so that even by very slight changes they sometimes make them mean the opposite of what they meant before;  as, for instance,
<milestone n="418b" unit="section"/>in the case of the word <foreign lang="greek">de/on</foreign> (obligation, right), for that just occurred to me and I was reminded of it by what I was going to say to you, that this fine modern language of ours has turned <foreign lang="greek">de/on</foreign> and also <foreign lang="greek">zhmiw=des</foreign> round, so that each has the opposite of its original meaning, whereas the ancient language shows clearly the real sense of both words.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>What do you mean?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>I will tell you.  You know that our ancestors made good use of the sounds of iota and delta,
<milestone n="418c" unit="section"/>and that is especially true of the women, who are most addicted to preserving old forms of speech.  But nowadays people change iota to eta or epsilon, and delta to zeta, thinking they have a grander sound.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>How is that?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>For instance, in the earliest times they called day <foreign lang="greek">i(me/ra</foreign>, others said <foreign lang="greek">e(me/ra</foreign>, and now they say <foreign lang="greek">h(me/ra</foreign>.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>That is true.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Only the ancient word discloses the intention of the name-giver, don't you know?  For day comes out of darkness to men;  they welcome it and long (<foreign lang="greek">i(mei/rousi</foreign>) for it,
<milestone n="418d" unit="section"/>and so they called it <foreign lang="greek">i(me/ra</foreign>.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>That is clear.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>But now <foreign lang="greek">h(me/ra</foreign> is masquerading so that you could not guess its meaning.  Why, some people think day is called <foreign lang="greek">h(me/ra</foreign> because it makes things gentle (<foreign lang="greek">h(/mera</foreign>).</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>I believe they do.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And you know the ancients called <foreign lang="greek">zugo/n</foreign> (yoke) <foreign lang="greek">duogo/n</foreign>.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>Certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And <foreign lang="greek">zugo/n</foreign> conveys no clear meaning,
<milestone n="418e" unit="section"/>but the name <foreign lang="greek">duogo/n</foreign> is quite properly given to that which binds two together for the purpose of draught; now, however, we say <foreign lang="greek">zugo/n</foreign>.  There are a great many other such instances.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>Yes, that is plain.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Similarly the word <foreign lang="greek">de/on</foreign> (obligation) at first, when spoken in this way, denotes the opposite of all words connected with the good;  for although it is a form of good, <foreign lang="greek">de/on</foreign> seems to be a bond (<foreign lang="greek">desmo/s</foreign>) and hindrance of motion, own brother, as it were, to<foreign lang="greek">blabero/n</foreign>.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>Yes, Socrates, it certainly does seem so.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>But it does not, if you employ the ancient word,
<milestone unit="page" n="419"/><milestone n="419a" unit="section"/>which is more likely to be right than the present one.  You will find that it agrees with the previous words for &ldquo;good,&rdquo; if instead of the epsilon you restore the iota, as it was in old times for <foreign lang="greek">dio/n</foreign> (going through), not <foreign lang="greek">de/on</foreign>, signifies good, which the name-giver praises.  And so the giver of names does not contradict himself, but <foreign lang="greek">de/on</foreign> (obligation, right), <foreign lang="greek">w)fe/limon</foreign> (useful), <foreign lang="greek">lusitelou=n</foreign> (profitable), <foreign lang="greek">kerdale/on</foreign> (gainful), <foreign lang="greek">a)gaqo/n</foreign> (good), <foreign lang="greek">cumfe/ron</foreign> (advantageous), and <foreign lang="greek">eu)/poron</foreign> (prosperous), are plainly identical, signifying under different names the principle of arrangement and motion which has constantly been praised,
<milestone n="419b" unit="section"/>whereas the principle of constraint and bondage is found fault with.  And likewise in the case of <foreign lang="greek">zhmiw=des</foreign>, if you restore the ancient delta in place of the zeta, you will see that the name, pronounced <foreign lang="greek">dhmiw=des</foreign>, was given to that which binds motion (<foreign lang="greek">dou=nti to\ i)o/n</foreign>).</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>What of <foreign lang="greek">h(donh/</foreign> (pleasure) and <foreign lang="greek">lu/ph</foreign> (pain) and <foreign lang="greek">e)piqumi/a</foreign> (desire), and the like, Socrates?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>I do not think they are at all difficult, Hermogenes, for <foreign lang="greek">h(donh/</foreign> appears to have this name because it is the action that tends towards advantage (<foreign lang="greek">h( pro\s th\n o)/nhsin tei/nousa</foreign>);  the delta is inserted, so that we say <foreign lang="greek">h(donh/</foreign> instead of <foreign lang="greek">h(onh/</foreign>.
<milestone n="419c" unit="section"/><foreign lang="greek">*lu/ph</foreign> appears to have received its name from the dissolution (<foreign lang="greek">dia/lusis</foreign>) of the body which takes place through pain.  <foreign lang="greek">*)ani/a</foreign> (sorrow) is that which hinders motion (<foreign lang="greek">i)e/nai</foreign>).  <foreign lang="greek">*)alghdw/n</foreign> (distress) is, I think, a foreign word, derived from <foreign lang="greek">a)lgeino/s</foreign> (distressing).  <foreign lang="greek">*)odu/nh</foreign> (grief) appears to be so called from the putting on of pain (<foreign lang="greek">th=s e)ndu/sews th=s lu/phs</foreign>).  <foreign lang="greek">*)axqhdw/n</foreign> (vexation) has a name, as anyone can see, made in the likeness of the weight (<foreign lang="greek">a)/xqos</foreign>, burden) which vexation imposes upon motion.  <foreign lang="greek">*xara/</foreign> (joy) seems to have its name from the plenteous diffusion (<foreign lang="greek">dia/xusis</foreign>) of the flow of the soul.
<milestone n="419d" unit="section"/><foreign lang="greek">*te/ryis</foreign> (delight) is from <foreign lang="greek">terpno/n</foreign> (delightful);  and <foreign lang="greek">terpno/n</foreign> is called from the creeping (<foreign lang="greek">e(/ryis</foreign>) of the soul, which is likened to a breath (<foreign lang="greek">pnoh/</foreign>), and would properly be called <foreign lang="greek">e(/rpnoun</foreign>, but the name has been changed in course of time to <foreign lang="greek">terpno/n</foreign>.  <foreign lang="greek">*eu)frosu/nh</foreign>(mirth) needs no explanation, for it is clear to anyone that from the motion of the soul in harmony (<foreign lang="greek">eu)=</foreign>) with the universe, it received the name <foreign lang="greek">eu)ferosu/nh</foreign>, as it rightfully is;  but we call it <foreign lang="greek">eufrosu/nh</foreign>.
<milestone n="419e" unit="section"/>Nor is there any difficulty about <foreign lang="greek">e)piqumi/a</foreign> (desire), for this name was evidently given to the power that goes (<foreign lang="greek">i)ou=sa</foreign>) into the soul (<foreign lang="greek">qumo/s</foreign>).  And <foreign lang="greek">qumo/s</foreign> has its name from the raging (<foreign lang="greek">qu/sis</foreign>) and boiling of the soul.  The name <foreign lang="greek">i(/meros</foreign> (longing) was given to the stream (<foreign lang="greek">r(ou=s</foreign>) which most draws the soul;
<milestone unit="page" n="420"/><milestone n="420a" unit="section"/>for because it flows with a rush (<foreign lang="greek">i(e/menos</foreign>) and with a desire for things and thus draws the soul on through the impulse of its flowing, all this power gives it the name of <foreign lang="greek">i(/meros</foreign>.  And the word <foreign lang="greek">po/qos</foreign> (yearning) signifies that it pertains not to that which is present, but to that which is elsewhere (<foreign lang="greek">a)/lloqi/ pou</foreign>) or absent, and therefore the same feeling which is called <foreign lang="greek">i(/meros</foreign> when its object is present, is called <foreign lang="greek">po/qos</foreign> when it is absent.  And <foreign lang="greek">e)/rws</foreign> (love) is so called because it flows in (<foreign lang="greek">e)srei=</foreign>) from without, and this flowing is not inherent in him who has it,
<milestone n="420b" unit="section"/>but is introduced through the eyes;  for this reason it was in ancient times called <foreign lang="greek">e)/sros</foreign>, from <foreign lang="greek">e)srei=n</foreign>&mdash;for we used to employ omicron instead of omega&mdash;but now it is called <foreign lang="greek">e)/rws</foreign> through the change of omicron to omega.  Well, what more is there that you want to examine?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>What is your view about <foreign lang="greek">do/ca</foreign> (opinion) and the like?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p><foreign lang="greek">*do/ca</foreign> is derived either from the pursuit (<foreign lang="greek">di/wcis</foreign>) which the soul carries on as it pursues the knowledge of the nature of things, or from the shooting of the bow (<foreign lang="greek">to/con</foreign>);  the latter is more likely;  at any rate <foreign lang="greek">oi)/hsis</foreign> (belief) supports this view,
<milestone n="420c" unit="section"/>for it appears to mean the motion (<foreign lang="greek">oi)=sis</foreign>) of the soul towards the essential nature of every individual thing, just as <foreign lang="greek">boulh/</foreign> (intention) denotes shooting (<foreign lang="greek">bolh/</foreign>) and <foreign lang="greek">bou/lesqai</foreign> (wish), as well as <foreign lang="greek">bouleu/esqai</foreign> (plan), denotes aiming at something.  All these words seem to follow <foreign lang="greek">do/ca</foreign> and to express the idea of shooting, just as <foreign lang="greek">a)bouli/a</foreign> (ill-advisedness), on the other hand, appears to be a failure to hit, as if a person did not shoot or hit that which he shot at or wished or planned or desired.
<milestone n="420d" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>I think you are hurrying things a bit, Socrates.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Yes, for I am running the last lap now. But I think I must still explain <foreign lang="greek">a)na/gkh</foreign> (compulsion) and <foreign lang="greek">e(kou/sion</foreign> (voluntary) because they naturally come next.  Now by the word <foreign lang="greek">e(kou/sion</foreign> is expressed the yielding (<foreign lang="greek">ei)=kon</foreign>) and not opposing, but, as I say, yielding to the motion which is in accordance with the will;  but the compulsory (<foreign lang="greek">to\ a)nagkai=on</foreign>) and resistant, being contrary to the will, is associated with error and ignorance;  so it is likened to walking through ravines (<foreign lang="greek">a)/gkh</foreign>),
<milestone n="420e" unit="section"/>because they are hard to traverse, rough, and rugged, and retard motion; the word <foreign lang="greek">a)nagkai=on</foreign> may, then, originate in a comparison with progress through a ravine.  But let us not cease to use my strength, so long as it lasts and do not you cease from asking questions.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>I ask, then, about the greatest and noblest words,
<milestone unit="page" n="421"/><milestone n="421a" unit="section"/>truth (<foreign lang="greek">a)lh/qeia</foreign>), falsehood (<foreign lang="greek">yeu=dos</foreign>), being (<foreign lang="greek">to\ o)/n</foreign>), and why name, the subject of our whole discourse, has the name <foreign lang="greek">o)/noma</foreign>.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Does the word <foreign lang="greek">mai/sqai</foreign> (search) mean anything to you?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>Yes, it means &ldquo;seek.&rdquo;</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>The word <foreign lang="greek">o)/noma</foreign> seems to be a word composed from a sentence signifying &ldquo;this is a being about which our search is.&rdquo; You can recognize that more readily in the adjective <foreign lang="greek">o)nomasto/n</foreign>, for that says clearly that this is
<milestone n="421b" unit="section"/><foreign lang="greek">o)/n ou(= ma/sma e)sti/n</foreign> (being of which the search is).  And <foreign lang="greek">a)lh/qeia</foreign> (truth) is like the others;  for the divine motion of the universe is, I think, called by this name, <foreign lang="greek">a)lh/qeia</foreign>, because it is a divine wandering <foreign lang="greek">qei/a a)/lh</foreign>.  But <foreign lang="greek">yeu=dos</foreign> (falsehood) is the opposite of motion;  for once more that which is held back and forced to be quiet is found fault with, and it is compared to slumberers (<foreign lang="greek">eu(/ousi</foreign>);  but the addition of the psi conceals the meaning of the word.  The words <foreign lang="greek">to\ o)/n</foreign> (being) and <foreign lang="greek">ou)si/a</foreign> (existence) agree with <foreign lang="greek">a)lhqh/s</foreign> with the loss of iota, for they mean &ldquo;going&rdquo; (<foreign lang="greek">i)o/n</foreign>).  And <foreign lang="greek">ou)k o)/n</foreign> (not being) means <foreign lang="greek">ou)k i)o/n</foreign> (not going),
<milestone n="421c" unit="section"/>and indeed some people pronounce it so.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>I think you have knocked these words to pieces manfully, Socrates;  but if anyone should ask you what propriety or correctness there was in these words that you have employed&mdash;<foreign lang="greek">i)o/n</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">re(/on</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">dou=n</foreign>&mdash;</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>What answer should I make?  Is that your meaning?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>Yes, exactly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>We acquired just now one way of making an answer with a semblance of sense in it.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>What way was that?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Saying, if there is a word we do not know about, that it is of foreign origin.
<milestone n="421d" unit="section"/>Now this may be true of some of them, and also on account of the lapse of time it may be impossible to find out about the earliest words;  for since words get twisted in all sorts of ways, it would not be in the least wonderful if the ancient Greek word should be identical with the modern foreign one.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>That is not unlikely.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>It is indeed quite probable.  However, we must play the game<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">A proverbial expression.</note> and investigate these questions vigorously.  But let us bear in mind that if a person asks
<milestone n="421e" unit="section"/>about the words by means of which names are formed, and again about those by means of which those words were formed, and keeps on doing this indefinitely, he who answers his questions will at last give up;  will he not?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>Yes, I think so.
<milestone unit="page" n="422"/><milestone n="422a" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Now at what point will he be right in giving up and stopping?  Will it not be when he reaches the names which are the elements of the other names and words?  For these, if they are the elements, can no longer rightly appear to be composed of other names.  For instance, we said just now that <foreign lang="greek">a)gaqo/n</foreign> was composed of <foreign lang="greek">a)gasto/n</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">qoo/n</foreign>;  and perhaps we might say that <foreign lang="greek">qoo/n</foreign> was composed of other words, and those of still others;
<milestone n="422b" unit="section"/>but if we ever get hold of a word which is no longer composed of other words, we should be right ill saying that we had at last reached an element, and that we must no longer refer to other words for its derivation.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>I think you are right.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Are, then, these words about which you are now asking elements, and must we henceforth investigate their correctness by some other method?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>Probably.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Yes, probably, Hermogenes;  at any rate, all the previous words were traced back to these.
<milestone n="422c" unit="section"/>But if this be true, as I think it is, come to my aid again and help me in the investigation, that I may not say anything foolish in declaring what principle must underlie the correctness of the earliest names.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>Go on, and I will help you to the best of my ability.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>I think you agree with me that there is but one principle of correctness in all names, the earliest as well as the latest, and that none of them is any more a name than the rest.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>Certainly.
<milestone n="422d" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Now the correctness of all the names we have discussed was based upon the intention of showing the nature of the things named.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>Yes, of course.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And this principle of correctness must be present in all names, the earliest as well as the later ones, if they are really to be names.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>Certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>But the later ones, apparently, were able to accomplish this by means of the earlier ones.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>Evidently.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Well, then, how can the earliest names, which are not as yet based upon any others, make clear to us the nature of things, so far as that is possible,
<milestone n="422e" unit="section"/>which they must do if they are to be names at all?  Answer me this question:  If we had no voice or tongue, and wished to make things clear to one another, should we not try, as dumb people actually do, to make signs with our hands and head and person generally?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>Yes.  What other method is there, Socrates?

<milestone n="423b" unit="section"/>would be accomplished by bodily imitation of that which was to be expressed.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And when we wish to express anything by voice or tongue or mouth, will not our expression by these means be accomplished in any given instance when an imitation of something is accomplished by them?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>I think that is inevitable.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>A name, then, it appears, is a vocal imitation of that which is imitated, and he who imitates with his voice names that which he imitates.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>I think that is correct.
<milestone n="423c" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>By Zeus, I do not think it is quite correct, yet, my friend.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>Why not?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>We should be obliged to agree that people who imitate sheep and cocks and other animals were naming those which they imitate.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>Yes, so we should.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And do you think that is correct?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>No, I do not;  but, Socrates, what sort of an imitation is a name?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>In the first place we shall not, in my opinion, be making names, if we imitate things as we do in music,
<milestone n="423d" unit="section"/>although musical imitation also is vocal;  and secondly we shall make no names by imitating that which music imitates.  What I mean is this:  all objects have sound and shape, and many have color, have they not?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>Certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Well then, the art of naming is not employed in the imitation of those qualities, and has nothing to do with them.  The arts which are concerned with them are music and design, are they not?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>Yes.
<milestone n="423e" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Here is another point.  Has not each thing an essential nature, just as it has a color and the other qualities we just mentioned?  Indeed, in the first place, have not color and sound and all other things which may properly be said to exist, each and all an essential nature?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>I think so.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Well, then, if anyone could imitate this essential nature of each thing by means of letters and syllables, he would show what each thing really is, would he not?
<milestone unit="page" n="424"/><milestone n="424a" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>Certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And what will you call him who can do this, as you called the others musician and painter?  What will you call this man?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>I think, Socrates, he is what we have been looking for all along, the name-maker.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>If that is the case, is it our next duty to consider whether in these names about which you were asking&mdash;flow, motion, and restraint&mdash;the namemaker grasps with his letters and syllables the reality
<milestone n="424b" unit="section"/>of the things named and imitates their essential nature, or not?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>Certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Well now, let us see whether those are the only primary names, or there are others.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>I think there are others.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Yes, most likely there are.  Now what is the method of division with which the imitator begins his imitation?  Since the imitation of the essential nature is made with letters and syllables, would not the most correct way be for us to separate the letters first,
<milestone n="424c" unit="section"/>just as those who undertake the practice of rhythms separate first the qualities of the letters, then those of the syllables, and then, but not till then, come to the study of rhythms?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Must not we, too, separate first the vowels, then in their several classes the consonants or mutes, as they are called by those who specialize in phonetics, and also the letters which are neither vowels nor mutes, as well as the various classes that exist among the vowels themselves?
<milestone n="424d" unit="section"/>And when we have made all these divisions properly, we must in turn give names to the things which ought to have them, if there are any names to which they can all, like the letters, be referred, from which it is possible to see what their nature is and whether there are any classes among them, as there are among letters. When we have properly examined all these points, we must know how to apply each letter with reference to its fitness, whether one letter is to be applied to one thing or many are to be combined;  just as painters, when they wish to produce an imitation, sometimes use only red,
<milestone n="424e" unit="section"/>sometimes some other color, and sometimes mix many colors, as when they are making a picture of a man or something of that sort, employing each color, I suppose, as they think the particular picture demands it.  In just this way we, too, shall apply letters to things, using one letter for one thing, when that seems to be required, or many letters together, forming syllables, as they are called, and in turn combining syllables,
<milestone unit="page" n="425"/><milestone n="425a" unit="section"/>and by their combination forming nouns and verbs.  And from nouns and verbs again we shall finally construct something great and fair and complete.  Just as in our comparison we made the picture by the art of painting, so now we shall make language by the art of naming, or of rhetoric, or whatever it be.  No, not we;  I said that too hastily.  For the ancients gave language its existing composite character;  and we, if we are to examine all these matters with scientific ability,
<milestone n="425b" unit="section"/>must take it to pieces as they put it together and see whether the words, both the earliest and the later, are given systematically or not;  for if they are strung together at haphazard, it is a poor, unmethodical performance, my dear Hermogenes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>By Zeus, Socrates, may be it is.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Well, do you believe you could take them to pieces in that way?  I do not believe I could.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>Then I am sure I could not.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Shall we give up then?  Or shall we do the best we can and try to see if we are able to understand even a little about them,
<milestone n="425c" unit="section"/>and, just as we said to the gods a while ago that we knew nothing about the truth but were guessing at human opinion about them, so now, before we proceed, shall we say to ourselves that if anyone, whether we or someone else, is to make any analysis of names, he will have to analyze them in the way we have described, and we shall have to study them, as the saying is, with all our might?  Do you agree, or not?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>Yes, I agree most heartily.
<milestone n="425d" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>It will, I imagine, seem ridiculous that things are made manifest through imitation in letters and syllables;  nevertheless it cannot be otherwise.  For there is no better theory upon which we can base the truth of the earliest names, unless you think we had better follow the example of the tragic poets, who, when they are in a dilemma, have recourse to the introduction of gods on machines.  So we may get out of trouble by saying that the gods gave the earliest names, and therefore they are right.
<milestone n="425e" unit="section"/>Is that the best theory for us?  Or perhaps this one, that we got the earliest names from some foreign folk and the foreigners are more ancient than we are?  Or that it is impossible to investigate them because of their antiquity, as is also the case with the foreign words?
<milestone unit="page" n="426"/><milestone n="426a" unit="section"/>All these are merely very clever evasions on the part of those who refuse to offer any rational theory of the correctness of the earliest names.  And yet if anyone is, no matter why, ignorant of the correctness of the earliest names, he cannot know about that of the later, since they can be explained only by means of the earliest, about which he is ignorant.  No, it is clear that anyone who claims to have scientific knowledge of names must be able first of all to explain the earliest names perfectly,
<milestone n="426b" unit="section"/>or he can be sure that what he says about the later will be nonsense.  Or do you disagree?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>No, Socrates, not in the least.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Now I think my notions about the earliest names are quite outrageous and ridiculous.  I will impart them to you, if you like; if you can find anything better, please try to impart it to me.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>I will do so.  Go on, and do not be afraid.
<milestone n="426c" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>First, then, the letter rho seems to me to be an instrument expressing all motion.  We have not as yet said why motion has the name <foreign lang="greek">ki/nhsis</foreign>;  but it evidently should be <foreign lang="greek">i)/esis</foreign>, for in old times we did not employ eta, but epsilon.  And the beginning of <foreign lang="greek">ki/nhsis</foreign> is from <foreign lang="greek">ki/ein</foreign>, a foreign word equivalent to <foreign lang="greek">i)e/nai</foreign> (go).  So we should find that the ancient word corresponding to our modern form would be <foreign lang="greek">i)/esis</foreign>; but now by the employment of the foreign word <foreign lang="greek">ki/ein</foreign>, change of epsilon to eta, and the insertion of nu it has become <foreign lang="greek">ki/nhsis</foreign>, though it ought to be <foreign lang="greek">kiei/nesis</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">ei)=sis</foreign>.
<milestone n="426d" unit="section"/>And <foreign lang="greek">sta/sis</foreign> (rest) signifies the negation of motion, but is called <foreign lang="greek">sta/sis</foreign> for euphony.  Well, the letter rho, as I was saying, appeared to be a fine instrument expressive of motion to the name-giver who wished to imitate rapidity, and he often applies it to motion.  In the first place, in the words <foreign lang="greek">r(ei=n</foreign> (flow) and <foreign lang="greek">r(oh/</foreign> (current) he imitates their rapidity by this letter,
<milestone n="426e" unit="section"/>then in <foreign lang="greek">tro/mos</foreign> (trembling) and in <foreign lang="greek">tre/xein</foreign> (run), and also in such words as <foreign lang="greek">krou/ein</foreign> (strike), <foreign lang="greek">qrau/ein</foreign> (break), <foreign lang="greek">e)rei/kein</foreign> (rend), <foreign lang="greek">qru/ptein</foreign> (crush),<foreign lang="greek">kermati/zein</foreign> (crumble), <foreign lang="greek">r(umbei=n</foreign> (whirl), he expresses the action of them all chiefly by means of the letter rho;  for he observed, I suppose, that the tongue is least at rest and most agitated in pronouncing this letter, and that is probably the reason why he employed it for these words.  Iota again, he employs for everything subtle, which can most readily pass through all things.
<milestone unit="page" n="427"/><milestone n="427a" unit="section"/>Therefore he imitates the nature of <foreign lang="greek">i)e/nai</foreign> (go) and <foreign lang="greek">i(/esqai</foreign> (hasten) by means of iota, just as he has imitated all such notions as <foreign lang="greek">yuxro/n</foreign> (cold, shivering), <foreign lang="greek">ze/on</foreign> (seething), <foreign lang="greek">sei/esqai</foreign> (shake), and <foreign lang="greek">seismo/s</foreign> (shock) by means of phi, psi, sigma, and zeta, because those letters are pronounced with much breath.  Whenever he imitates that which resembles blowing, the giver of names always appears to use for the most part such letters.  And again he appears to have thought that the compression and pressure of the tongue in the pronunciation of delta and tau was naturally fitted
<milestone n="427b" unit="section"/>to imitate the notion of binding and rest.  And perceiving that the tongue has a gliding movement most in the pronunciation of lambda, he made the words <foreign lang="greek">lei=a</foreign> (level), <foreign lang="greek">o)lisqa/nain</foreign> (glide) itself, <foreign lang="greek">liparo/n</foreign> (sleek), <foreign lang="greek">kollw=des</foreign> (glutinous), and the like to conform to it.  Where the gliding of the tongue is stopped by the sound of gamma he reproduced the nature of <foreign lang="greek">glisxro/n</foreign> (glutinous), <foreign lang="greek">gluku/</foreign> (sweet), and <foreign lang="greek">gloiw=des</foreign> (gluey).
<milestone n="427c" unit="section"/>And again, perceiving that nu is an internal sound, he made the words <foreign lang="greek">e)/ndon</foreign> (inside) and <foreign lang="greek">e)nto/s</foreign> (within), assimilating the meanings to the letters, and alpha again he assigned to greatness, and eta to length, because the letters are large.  He needed the sign <foreign lang="greek">*o</foreign> for the expression of <foreign lang="greek">go/ggulon</foreign> (round), and made it the chief element of the word.  And in this way the lawgiver appears to apply the other letters, making by letters and syllables a name for each and every thing, and from these names he compounds all the rest by imitation.
<milestone n="427d" unit="section"/>This, Hermogenes, appears to me to be the theory of the correctness of names, unless, indeed, Cratylus has some other view.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>Truly, Socrates, as I said in the beginning, Cratylus often troubles me a good deal;  he declares that there is such a thing as correctness of names, but does not say clearly what it is;  and so I cannot tell whether he speaks so obscurely about it on any given occasion intentionally or unintentionally.
<milestone n="427e" unit="section"/>So now, Cratylus, tell me, in the presence of Socrates, do you like what Socrates says about names, or have you a better theory to propose?  And if you have, tell us about it;  then you will either learn from Socrates or instruct both him and me.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Cratylus</speaker><p>But, Hermogenes, do you think it is an easy matter to learn or teach any subject so quickly, especially so important an one as this, which appears to me to be one of the most important?
    <milestone unit="page" n="428"/><milestone n="428a" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Hermogenes</speaker><p>No, by Zeus, I do not.  But I think Hesiod is right in saying:<quote type="verse"><l met="dactylic">If you can only add little to little, it is worth while.</l></quote><bibl n="Hes. WD 359">Hes. WD 359</bibl> So now if you can make even a little progress, do not shirk the trouble, but oblige Socrates&mdash;you owe it to him&mdash;and me.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>For that matter, Cratylus, I would not positively affirm any of the things I have said.  I merely expressed the opinions which I reached with the help of Hermogenes.  So far as I am concerned, you need not hesitate,
<milestone n="428b" unit="section"/>and if your view is better than mine, I will accept it.  And I should not be at all surprised if it were better;  for I think you have not only investigated such matters yourself but have been taught about them by others.  So if you have any better theory to propound, put me down as one of your pupils in the course on the correctness of names.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Cratylus</speaker><p>Yes, Socrates, I have, as you say, paid attention to these matters, and perhaps I might make you my pupil.  However, I am afraid the opposite is the case,
    <milestone n="428c" unit="section"/>and I am impelled to say to you what Achilles says in the &ldquo;Prayers&rdquo; to Ajax.  He says:<quote type="verse"><l met="dactylic">Ajax, descendant of Zeus, son of Telamon, chief of thy people,</l><l>All thou hast uttered is good in my sight and pleases my spirit.</l></quote><bibl n="Hom. Il. 9.644">Hom. Il. 9.644 f</bibl> And so, Socrates, your oracular utterances seem to me to be much to my mind, whether you are inspired by Euthyphro or some other Muse has dwelt within you all along without our knowing it.
    <milestone n="428d" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>My excellent Cratylus, I myself have been marvelling at my own wisdom all along, and I cannot believe in it.  So I think we ought to reexamine my utterances.  For the worst of all deceptions is self-deception.  How can it help being terrible, when the deceiver is always present and never stirs from the spot?  So I think we must turn back repeatedly to what we have said and must try, as the poet says, to look <quote type="verse"><l met="dactylic">both forwards and backwards.</l></quote><bibl n="Hom. Il. 1.343">Hom. Il. 1.343; 3.109</bibl>
<milestone n="428e" unit="section"/>Then let us now see what we have said.  Correctness of a name, we say, is the quality of showing the nature of the thing named.  Shall we call that a satisfactory statement?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Cratylus</speaker><p>I am perfectly satisfied with it, Socrates.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Names, then, are given with a view to instruction?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Cratylus</speaker><p>Certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Shall we, then;  say that this instruction is an art and has its artisans?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Cratylus</speaker><p>Certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Who are they?
<milestone unit="page" n="429"/><milestone n="429a" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Cratylus</speaker><p>The lawgivers, as you said in the beginning.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Shall we declare that this art arises in men like the other arts, or not?  What I mean is this:  Some painters are better, and others worse, are they not?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Cratylus</speaker><p>Certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And the better produce better works&mdash;that is, their paintings&mdash;and the others worse works?  And likewise some builders build better houses and others worse?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Cratylus</speaker><p>Yes.
<milestone n="429b" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then do some lawgivers produce better, and others worse works?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Cratylus</speaker><p>No;  at that point I cease to agree.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then you do not think that some laws are better, and some worse?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Cratylus</speaker><p>No, I do not.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And you do not, it appears, think that one name is better, and another worse?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Cratylus</speaker><p>No, I do not.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then all names are correct?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Cratylus</speaker><p>All that are really names.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>How about the name of our friend Hermogenes,
<milestone n="429c" unit="section"/>which was mentioned a while ago?  Shall we say that it is not his name at all, unless he belongs to the race of Hermes, or that it is his name, but is incorrect?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Cratylus</speaker><p>I think, Socrates, that it is not his name at all;  it appears to be his, but is really the name of some one else who possesses the nature that makes the name clear.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And when anyone says that our friend is Hermogenes, is he not even speaking falsely?  For perhaps it is not even possible to say that he is Hermogenes, if he is not.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Cratylus</speaker><p>What do you mean?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Do you mean to say that it is impossible to speak falsehood at all?
<milestone n="429d" unit="section"/>For there are, my dear Cratylus, many who do so, and who have done so in the past.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Cratylus</speaker><p>Why, Socrates, how could anyone who says that which he says, say that which is not?  Is not falsehood saying that which is not?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Your reasoning is too clever for me at my age, my friend.  However, tell me this:  Do you think it is possible to speak falsehood,
<milestone n="429e" unit="section"/>but not to say it?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Cratylus</speaker><p>Neither to speak nor to say it.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Nor utter it or use it as a form of address?  For instance, if some one should meet you in hospitable fashion, should grasp your hand and say, &ldquo;Well met, my friend from <placeName key="tgn,7001393">Athens</placeName>, son of Smicrion, Hermogenes,&rdquo; would he be saying or speaking or uttering or addressing these words not to you, but to Hermogenes&mdash;or to nobody?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Cratylus</speaker><p>I think, Socrates, the man would be producing sounds without sense.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Even that reply is welcome;
<milestone unit="page" n="430"/><milestone n="430a" unit="section"/>for I can ask whether the words he produced would be true, or false, or partly true and partly false.  Even that would suffice.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Cratylus</speaker><p>I should say that the man in such a case was merely making a noise, going through purposeless motions, as if he were beating a bronze pot.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Let us see, Cratylus, if we cannot come to terms somehow.  You would agree, would you not, that the name is one thing and the thing of which it is the name is another?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Cratylus</speaker><p>Yes, I should.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And you agree that the name is an imitation
<milestone n="430b" unit="section"/>of the thing named?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Cratylus</speaker><p>Most assuredly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And you agree that paintings also are imitations, though in a different way, of things?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Cratylus</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Well then&mdash;for perhaps I do not understand, and you may be right&mdash;can both of these imitations, the paintings and the names, be assigned and applied to the things which they imitate, or not?
<milestone n="430c" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Cratylus</speaker><p>They can.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>First, then, consider this question:  Can we assign the likeness of the man to the man and that of the woman to the woman, and so forth?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Cratylus</speaker><p>Certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And can we conversely attribute that of the man to the woman, and the woman's to the man?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Cratylus</speaker><p>That is also possible.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And are these assignments both correct, or only the former?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Cratylus</speaker><p>The former.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>The assignment, in short, which attributes to each that which belongs to it and is like it.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Cratylus</speaker><p>That is my view.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>To put an end to contentious argument between you and me,
<milestone n="430d" unit="section"/>since we are friends, let me state my position.  I call that kind of assignment in the case of both imitations paintings and names&mdash;correct, and in the case of names not only correct, but true;  and the other kind, which gives and applies the unlike imitation, I call incorrect and, in the case of names, false.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Cratylus</speaker><p>But it may be, Socrates, that this incorrect assignment is possible in the case of paintings, and not in the case of names,
<milestone n="430e" unit="section"/>which must be always correctly assigned.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>What do you mean?  What difference is there between the two?  Can I not step up to a man and say to him, &ldquo;This is your portrait,&rdquo; and show him perhaps his own likeness or, perhaps, that of a woman?  And by &ldquo;show&rdquo; I mean bring before the sense of sight.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Cratylus</speaker><p>Certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Well, then, can I not step up to the same man again and say, &ldquo;This is your name&rdquo;?  A name is an imitation, just as a picture is.
<milestone unit="page" n="431"/><milestone n="431a" unit="section"/>Very well;  can I not say to him, &ldquo;This is your name,&rdquo; and then bring before his sense of hearing perhaps the imitation of himself, saying that it is a man, or perhaps the imitation of the female of the human species, saying that it is a woman?  Do you not believe that this is possible and sometimes happens?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Cratylus</speaker><p>I am willing to concede it, Socrates, and grant that you are right.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>That is a good thing for you to do, my friend, if I am right;  for now we need no longer argue about the matter.
<milestone n="431b" unit="section"/>If, then, some such assignment of names takes place, we will call one kind speaking truth, and the other speaking falsehood.  But if this is accepted, and if it is possible to assign names incorrectly and to give to objects not the names that befit them, but sometimes those that are unfitting, it would be possible to treat verbs in the same way.  And if verbs and nouns can be assigned in this way, the same must be true of sentences;  for sentences are, I conceive, a combination of verbs and nouns.
<milestone n="431c" unit="section"/>What do you say to that, Cratylus?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Cratylus</speaker><p>I agree; I think you are right.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>If, then, we compare the earliest words to sketches, it is possible in them, as in pictures, to reproduce all the colors and shapes, or not all; some may be wanting, and some may be added, and they may be too many or too large.  Is not that true?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Cratylus</speaker><p>Yes, it is.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then he who reproduces all, produces good sketches and pictures, and he who adds or takes away produces also sketches and pictures, but bad ones?
<milestone n="431d" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Cratylus</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And how about him who imitates the nature of things by means of letters and syllables?  By the same principle, if he gives all that is appropriate, the image&mdash;that is to say, the name&mdash;will be good, and if he sometimes omits a little, it will be an image, but not a good one;  and therefore some names are well and others badly made.  Is that not true?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Cratylus</speaker><p>Perhaps.
<milestone n="431e" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Perhaps, then, one artisan of names will be good, and another bad?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Cratylus</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>The name of such an artisan was lawgiver?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Cratylus</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Perhaps, then, by Zeus, as is the case in the other arts, one lawgiver may be good and another bad, if we accept our previous conclusions.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Cratylus</speaker><p>That is true.  But you see, Socrates, when by the science of grammar we assign these letters&mdash;alpha, beta, and the rest&mdash;to names,
<milestone unit="page" n="432"/><milestone n="432a" unit="section"/>if we take away or add or transpose any letter, it is not true that the name is written, but written incorrectly;  it is not written at all, but immediately becomes a different word, if any such thing happens to it.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Perhaps we are not considering the matter in the right way.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Cratylus</speaker><p>Why not?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>It may be that what you say would be true of those things which must necessarily consist of a certain number or cease to exist at all, as ten, for instance, or any number you like,
<milestone n="432b" unit="section"/>if you add or subtract anything is immediately another number;  but this is not the kind of correctness which applies to quality or to images in general;  on the contrary, the image must not by any means reproduce all the qualities of that which it imitates, if it is to be an image.  See if I am not right.  Would there be two things, Cratylus and the image of Cratylus, if some god should not merely imitate your color and form, as painters do, but should also make all the inner parts like yours, should reproduce
<milestone n="432c" unit="section"/>the same flexibility and warmth, should put into them motion, life, and intellect, such as exist in you, and in short, should place beside you a duplicate of all your qualities?  Would there be in such an event Cratylus and an image of Cratylus, or two Cratyluses?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Cratylus</speaker><p>I should say, Socrates, two Cratyluses.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then don't you see, my friend, that we must look for some other principle of correctness in images and in names, of which we were speaking, and must not insist that they are no longer images
<milestone n="432d" unit="section"/>if anything be wanting or be added?  Do you not perceive how far images are from possessing the same qualities as the originals which they imitate?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Cratylus</speaker><p>Yes, I do.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Surely, Cratylus, the effect produced by the names upon the things of which they are the names would be ridiculous, if they were to be entirely like them in every respect.  For everything would be duplicated, and no one could tell in any case which was the real thing and which the name.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Cratylus</speaker><p>Quite true.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then do not be faint-hearted, but have the courage to admit that one name may be correctly and another incorrectly given;
<milestone n="432e" unit="section"/>do not insist that it must have all the letters and be exactly the same as the thing named, but grant that an inappropriate letter may be employed.  But if a letter, then grant that also a noun in a clause, and if a noun, then also a clause in a sentence may be employed which is not appropriate to the things in question, and the thing may none the less be named and described, so long as the intrinsic quality of the thing named is retained,
<milestone unit="page" n="433"/><milestone n="433a" unit="section"/>as is the case in the names of the letters of the alphabet, if you remember what Hermogenes and I were saying a while ago.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Cratylus</speaker><p>Yes, I remember.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Very well, then.  So long as this intrinsic quality is present, even though the name have not all the proper letters, the thing will still be named;  well, when it has all the proper letters;  badly, when it has only a few of them.  Let us, then, grant this, my friend, or we shall get into trouble, like the belated night wanderers in the road at <placeName key="tgn,7011087">Aegina</placeName>,<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">This seems to refer to some story unknown to us.</note> and in very truth we shall be found to have arrived too late;
<milestone n="433b" unit="section"/>otherwise you must look for some other principle of correctness in names, and must not admit that a name is the representation of a thing in syllables and letters.  For if you maintain both positions, you cannot help contradicting yourself.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Cratylus</speaker><p>Well, Socrates, I think what you say is reasonable, and I accept it.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then since we are agreed about this, let us consider the next point.  If a name, we say, is to be a good one, it must have the proper letters?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Cratylus</speaker><p>Yes.
<milestone n="433c" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And the proper letters are those which are like the things named?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Cratylus</speaker><p>Yes, certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>That is, then, the method by which wellgiven names are given.  But if any name is not well given, the greater part of it may perhaps, if it is to be an image at all, be made up of proper and like letters, but it may contain some inappropriate element, and is on that account not good or well made.  Is that our view?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Cratylus</speaker><p>I suppose, Socrates, there is no use in keeping up my contention;  but I am not satisfied that it can be a name and not be well given.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Are you not satisfied that the name is
<milestone n="433d" unit="section"/>the representation of a thing?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Cratylus</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And do you not think it is true that some names are composed of earlier ones and others are primary?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Cratylus</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>But if the primary names are to be representations of any things, can you suggest any better way of making them representations than by making them as much as possible like the things which they are to represent?
<milestone n="433e" unit="section"/>Or do you prefer the theory advanced by Hermogenes and many others, who claim that names are conventional and represent things to those who established the convention and knew the things beforehand, and that convention is the sole principle of correctness in names, and it makes no difference whether we accept the existing convention or adopt an opposite one according to which small would be called great and great small? Which of these two theories do you prefer?
<milestone unit="page" n="434"/><milestone n="434a" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Cratylus</speaker><p>Representing by likeness the thing represented is absolutely and entirely superior to representation by chance signs.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>You are right.  Then if the name is like the thing, the letters of which the primary names are to be formed must be by their very nature like the things, must they not?  Let me explain.  Could a painting, to revert to our previous comparison, ever be made like any real thing, if there were no pigments out of which the painting is composed,
<milestone n="434b" unit="section"/>which were by their nature like the objects which the painter's art imitates?  Is not that impossible?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Cratylus</speaker><p>Yes, it is impossible.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>In the same way, names can never be like anything unless those elements of which the names are composed exist in the first place and possess some kind of likeness to the things which the names imitate;  and the elements of which they are composed are the letters, are they not?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Cratylus</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then I must now ask you to consider with me the subject which Hermogenes and I discussed a while ago.
<milestone n="434c" unit="section"/>Do you think I am right in saying that rho is expressive of speed, motion, and hardness, or not?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Cratylus</speaker><p>You are right.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And lambda is like smoothness, softness, and the other qualities we mentioned?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Cratylus</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>You know, of course, that we call the same thing <foreign lang="greek">sklhro/ths</foreign> (hardness) which the Eretrians call <foreign lang="greek">sklhro/thr</foreign>?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Cratylus</speaker><p>Certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Have rho and sigma both a likeness to the same thing, and does the final rho mean to them just what the sigma means to us, or is there to one of us no meaning?
<milestone n="434d" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Cratylus</speaker><p>They mean the same to both.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>In so far as rho and sigma are alike, or in so far as they are not?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Cratylus</speaker><p>In so far as they are alike.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And are they alike in all respects?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Cratylus</speaker><p>Yes;  at least for the purpose of expressing motion equally.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>But how about the lambda in <foreign lang="greek">sklhro/ths</foreign>? Does it not express the opposite of hardness?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Cratylus</speaker><p>Well, perhaps it has no right to be there, Socrates;  it may be like the cases that came up in your talk with Hermogenes, when you removed or inserted letters where that was necessary.  I think you did right;  and in this case perhaps we ought to put a rho in place of the lambda.
<milestone n="434e" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Excellent.  However, do we not understand one another when anyone says <foreign lang="greek">sklhro/n</foreign>, using the present pronunciation, and do you not now know what I mean?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Cratylus</speaker><p>Yes, but that is by custom, my friend.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>In saying &ldquo;custom&rdquo; do you think you are saying anything different from convention?  Do you not mean by &ldquo;convention&rdquo; that when I speak I have a definite meaning and you recognize that I have that meaning?  Is not that what you mean?
<milestone unit="page" n="435"/><milestone n="435a" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Cratylus</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then if you recognize my meaning when I speak, that is an indication given to you by me.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Cratylus</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>The indication comes from something which is unlike my meaning when I speak, if in your example <foreign lang="greek">sklhro/ths</foreign> the lambda is unlike hardness;  and if this is true, did you not make a convention with yourself, since both like and unlike letters, by the influence of custom and convention, produce indication?  And even if custom is entirely distinct from convention,
<milestone n="435b" unit="section"/>we should henceforth be obliged to say that custom, not likeness, is the principle of indication, since custom, it appears, indicates both by the like and by the unlike.  And since we grant this, Cratylus&mdash;for I take it that your silence gives consent&mdash;both convention and custom must contribute something towards the indication of our meaning when we speak.  For, my friend, if you will just turn your attention to numbers, where do you think you can possibly get names to apply to each individual number on the principle of likeness,
<milestone n="435c" unit="section"/>unless you allow agreement and convention on your part to control the correctness of names?  I myself prefer the theory that names are, so far as is possible, like the things named;  but really this attractive force of likeness is, as Hermogenes says, a poor thing, and we are compelled to employ in addition this commonplace expedient, convention, to establish the correctness of names.  Probably language would be, within the bounds of possibility, most excellent when all its terms, or as many as possible, were based on likeness, that is to say, were appropriate, and most deficient under opposite conditions.
<milestone n="435d" unit="section"/>But now answer the next question.  What is the function of names, and what good do they accomplish?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Cratylus</speaker><p>I think, Socrates, their function is to instruct, and this is the simple truth, that he who knows the names knows also the things named.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>I suppose, Cratylus, you mean that when anyone knows the nature of the name&mdash;and its nature is that of the thing&mdash;he will know the thing also,
<milestone n="435e" unit="section"/>since it is like the name, and the science of all things which are like each other is one and the same.  It is, I fancy, on this ground that you say whoever knows names will know things also.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Cratylus</speaker><p>You are perfectly right.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Now let us see what this manner of giving instruction is, to which you refer, and whether there is another method, but inferior to this, or there is no other at all.  What do you think?
<milestone unit="page" n="436"/><milestone n="436a" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Cratylus</speaker><p>I think there is no other at all;  this is both the best and the only method.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Do you think this is also the method of discovering realities, and that he who has discovered the names has discovered also the things named;  or do you think inquiry and discovery demand another method, and this belongs to instruction?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Cratylus</speaker><p>I most certainly think inquiry and discovery follow this same method and in the same way.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Let us consider the matter, Cratylus.  Do you not see that he who in his inquiry after things follows names
<milestone n="436b" unit="section"/>and examines into the meaning of each one runs great risks of being deceived?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Cratylus</speaker><p>How so?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Clearly he who first gave names, gave such names as agreed with his conception of the nature of things.  That is our view, is it not?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Cratylus</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then if his conception was incorrect, and he gave the names according to his conception, what do you suppose will happen to us who follow him?  Can we help being deceived?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Cratylus</speaker><p>But, Socrates, surely that is not the case.
<milestone n="436c" unit="section"/>He who gave the names must necessarily have known;  otherwise, as I have been saying all along, they would not be names at all.  And there is a decisive proof that the name-giver did not miss the truth, one which you must accept;  for otherwise his names would not be so universally consistent.  Have you not yourself noticed in speaking that all names were formed by the same method and with the same end in view?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>But that, Cratylus, is no counter argument.  For if the giver of names erred in the beginning
<milestone n="436d" unit="section"/>and thenceforth forced all other names into agreement with his own initial error, there is nothing strange about that.  It is just so sometimes in geometrical diagrams;  the initial error is small and unnoticed, but all the numerous deductions are wrong, though consistent.  Every one must therefore give great care and great attention to the beginning of any undertaking, to see whether his foundation is right or not.  If that has been considered with proper care, everything else will follow.
<milestone n="436e" unit="section"/>However, I should be surprised if names are really consistent.  Let us review our previous discussion. Names, we said, indicate nature to us, assuming that all things are in motion and flux.  Do you not think they do so?
<milestone unit="page" n="437"/><milestone n="437a" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Cratylus</speaker><p>Yes, and they indicate it correctly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Let us first take up again the word <foreign lang="greek">e)pisth/mh</foreign> (knowledge) and see how ambiguous it is, seeming to indicate that it makes our soul stand still (<foreign lang="greek">i(/sthsin</foreign>) at things, rather than that it is carried round with them, so it is better to speak the beginning of it as we now do than to insert the epsilon and say <foreign lang="greek">e)pei+sth/m</foreign>;  we should insert an iota rather than an epsilon.  Then take <foreign lang="greek">be/baion</foreign> (firm), which expresses position and rest, not motion.
<milestone n="437b" unit="section"/>And <foreign lang="greek">i(stori/a</foreign> (inquiry) means much the same, that it stops (<foreign lang="greek">i(/sthsin</foreign>) the flow.  And <foreign lang="greek">pisto/n</foreign> (faithful) most certainly means that which stops (<foreign lang="greek">i(sto/n</foreign>) motion.  Then again, anyone can see that <foreign lang="greek">mnh/mh</foreign> (memory) expresses rest (<foreign lang="greek">monh/</foreign>) in the soul, not motion.  On the other hand, <foreign lang="greek">a(marti/a</foreign> (error) and <foreign lang="greek">cumfora/</foreign> (misfortune), if you consider merely the form of the names, will appear to be the same as <foreign lang="greek">su/nesis</foreign> (intellect) and <foreign lang="greek">e)pisth/mh</foreign> and all the other names of good significance.  Moreover, <foreign lang="greek">a)maqi/a</foreign> (ignorance) and <foreign lang="greek">a)kolasi/a</foreign> (unrestraint) also appear to be like them;  for the former, <foreign lang="greek">a)maqi/a</foreign>,
<milestone n="437c" unit="section"/>seems to be <foreign lang="greek">tou= a(/ma qew=| i)o/ntos porei/a</foreign> (the progress of one who goes with God), and <foreign lang="greek">a)kolasi/a</foreign> seems to be exactly <foreign lang="greek">a)kolouqi/a toi=s pra/gmasin</foreign> (movement in company with things).  And so names which we believe have the very worst meanings appear to be very like those which have the best.  And I think we could, if we took pains, find many other words which would lead us to reverse our judgement and believe that the giver of names meant that things were not in progress or in motion, but were at rest.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Cratylus</speaker><p>But, Socrates, you see that most of the names
<milestone n="437d" unit="section"/>indicate motion.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>What of that, Cratylus?  Are we to count names like votes, and shall correctness rest with the majority?  Are those to be the true names which are found to have that one of the two meanings which is expressed by the greater number?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Cratylus</speaker><p>That is not reasonable.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>No, not in the least, my friend.
<milestone unit="page" n="438"/><milestone n="438a" unit="section"/>Now let us drop this and return to the point at which we digressed.  A little while ago, you may remember, you said he who gave names must have known the things to which he gave them.  Do you still hold that opinion, or not?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Cratylus</speaker><p>I do.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And you say that he who gave the first names also knew the things which he named?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Cratylus</speaker><p>Yes, he knew them.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>But from what names had he learned or discovered the things,
<milestone n="438b" unit="section"/>if the first names had not yet been given, and if we declare that it is impossible to learn or discover things except by learning or ourselves discovering the names?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Cratylus</speaker><p>I think there is something in what you say, Socrates.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>How can we assert that they gave names or were lawgivers with knowledge, before any name whatsoever had been given, and before they knew any names, if things cannot be learned except through their names?
<milestone n="438c" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Cratylus</speaker><p>I think the truest theory of the matter, Socrates, is that the power which gave the first names to things is more than human, and therefore the names must necessarily be correct.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then, in your opinion, he who gave the names, though he was a spirit or a god, would have given names which made him contradict himself? Or do you think there is no sense in what we were saying just now?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Cratylus</speaker><p>But, Socrates, those that make up one of the two classes are not really names.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Which of the two, my excellent friend;  the class of those which point towards rest or of those that point towards motion?  We agreed just now that the matter is not to be determined by mere numbers.
<milestone n="438d" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Cratylus</speaker><p>No;  that would not be right, Socrates.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then since the names are in conflict, and some of them claim that they are like the truth, and others that they are, how can we decide, and upon what shall we base our decision?  Certainly not upon other names differing from these, for there are none.  No, it is plain that we must look for something else, not names, which shall show us which of these two kinds are the true names, which of them, that is to say,
<milestone n="438e" unit="section"/>show the truth of things.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Cratylus</speaker><p>That is my opinion.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then if that is true, Cratylus, it seems that things may be learned without names.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Cratylus</speaker><p>So it appears.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>What other way is left by which you could expect to know them?  What other than the natural and the straightest way, through each other, if they are akin, and through themselves?  For that which is other and different from them would signify not them, but something other and different.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Cratylus</speaker><p>I think that is true.
<milestone unit="page" n="439"/><milestone n="439a" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Stop for Heaven's sake!  Did we not more than once agree that names which are rightly given are like the things named and are images of them?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Cratylus</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then if it be really true that things can be learned either through names or through themselves which would be the better and surer way of learning?  To learn from the image whether it is itself a good imitation and also to learn the truth which it imitates,
<milestone n="439b" unit="section"/>or to learn from the truth both the truth itself and whether the image is properly made?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Cratylus</speaker><p>I think it is certainly better to learn from the truth.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>How realities are to be learned or discovered is perhaps too great a question for you or me to determine;  but it is worth while to have reached even this conclusion, that they are to be learned and sought for, not from names but much better through themselves than through names.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Cratylus</speaker><p>That is clear, Socrates.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then let us examine one further point to avoid being deceived by the fact that most of these names tend in the same direction.
<milestone n="439c" unit="section"/>Suppose it should prove that although those who gave the names gave them in the belief that all things are in motion and flux&mdash;I myself think they did have that belief&mdash; still in reality that is not the case, and the namegivers themselves, having fallen into a kind of vortex, are whirled about, dragging us along with them.  Consider, my worthy Cratylus, a question about which I often dream.  Shall we assert that there is any absolute beauty, or good, or any other absolute existence,
<milestone n="439d" unit="section"/>or not?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Cratylus</speaker><p>I think there is, Socrates.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then let us consider the absolute, not whether a particular face, or something of that sort, is beautiful, or whether all these things are in flux.  Is not, in our opinion, absolute beauty always such as it is?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Cratylus</speaker><p>That is inevitable.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Can we, then, if it is always passing away, correctly say that it is this, then that it is that, or must it inevitably, in the very instant while we are speaking, become something else and pass away and no longer be what it is?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Cratylus</speaker><p>That is inevitable.
<milestone n="439e" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>How, then, can that which is never in the same state be anything?  For if it is ever in the same state, then obviously at that time it is not changing;  and if it is always in the same state and is always the same, how can it ever change or move without relinquishing its own form?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Cratylus</speaker><p>It cannot do so at all.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>No, nor can it be known by anyone.
<milestone unit="page" n="440"/><milestone n="440a" unit="section"/>For at the moment when he who seeks to know it approaches, it becomes something else and different, so that its nature and state can no longer be known;  and surely there is no knowledge which knows that which is in no state.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Cratylus</speaker><p>It is as you say.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>But we cannot even say that there is any knowledge, if all things are changing and nothing remains fixed;  for if knowledge itself does not change and cease to be knowledge, then knowledge would remain, and there would be knowledge;  but if the very essence of knowledge changes,
<milestone n="440b" unit="section"/>at the moment of the change to another essence of knowledge there would be no knowledge, and if it is always changing, there will always be no knowledge, and by this reasoning there will be neither anyone to know nor anything to be known.  But if there is always that which knows and that which is known&mdash;if the beautiful, the good, and all the other verities exist&mdash;I do not see how there is any likeness between these conditions of which I am now speaking and flux or motion.
<milestone n="440c" unit="section"/>Now whether this is the nature of things, or the doctrine of Heracleitus and many others is true, is another question;  but surely no man of sense can put himself and his soul under the control of names, and trust in names and their makers to the point of affirming that he knows anything;  nor will he condemn himself and all things and say that there is no health in them, but that all things are flowing like leaky pots,
<milestone n="440d" unit="section"/>or believe that all things are just like people afflicted with catarrh, flowing and running all the time.  Perhaps, Cratylus, this theory is true, but perhaps it is not.  Therefore you must consider courageously and thoroughly and not accept anything carelessly&mdash;for you are still young and in your prime;  then, if after investigation you find the truth, impart it to me.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Cratylus</speaker><p>I will do so.  However, I assure you, Socrates, that I have already considered the matter, and after toilsome consideration
<milestone n="440e" unit="section"/>I think the doctrine of Heracleitus is much more likely to be true.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Some other time, then, my friend, you will teach me, when you come back;  but now go into the country as you have made ready to do;  and Hermogenes here will go with you a bit.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Cratylus</speaker><p>Very well, Socrates, and I hope you also will continue to think of these matters.</p></sp></body></text>

So I went along with him, and as I was coming back I thought of Socrates and wondered at his prophetic gift, especially in what he said about him.  For I think he met him a little before his own death, when Theaetetus was a mere boy, and as a result of acquaintance and conversation with him, he greatly admired his qualities.  When I went to <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> he related to me the conversation
<milestone n="142d" unit="section"/>he had with him, which was well worth hearing, and he said he would surely become a notable man if he lived.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Terpsion</speaker><p>And he was right, apparently.

<milestone unit="page" n="143"/><milestone n="143a" unit="section"/>But I made notes at the time as soon as I reached home, then afterwards at my leisure, as I recalled things, I wrote them down, and whenever I went to <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> I used to ask Socrates about what I could not remember, and then I came here and made corrections;  so that I have pretty much the whole talk written down.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Terpsion</speaker><p>That is true.  I heard you say so before;  and really I have been waiting about here all along intending to ask you to show it to me.  What hinders us from reading it now?  Certainly I need to rest, since I have come from the country.
<milestone n="143b" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Eucleides</speaker><p>And I myself went with Theaetetus as far as Erineum,<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">Erineum was between <placeName key="perseus,Eleusis">Eleusis</placeName> and <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, near the Cephissus.

Come, let us go, and while we are resting, the boy shall read to us.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Terpsion</speaker><p>Very well.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Eucleides</speaker><p>Here is the book, Terpsion.  Now this is the way I wrote the conversation:  I did not represent Socrates relating it to me, as he did, but conversing with those with whom he told me he conversed.  And he told me they were the geometrician Theodorus and Theaetetus.  Now in order that
<milestone n="143c" unit="section"/>the explanatory words between the speeches might not be annoying in the written account, such as &ldquo;and I said&rdquo; or &ldquo;and I remarked,&rdquo; whenever Socrates spoke, or &ldquo;he agreed or he did not agree,&rdquo; in the case of the interlocutor, I omitted all that sort of thing and represented Socrates himself as talking with them.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Terpsion</speaker><p>That is quite fitting, Eucleides.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Eucleides</speaker><p>Come, boy, take the book and read.
<milestone n="0" unit="embedded dialog"/><milestone n="143d" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>If I cared more for <placeName key="tgn,7000639">Cyrene</placeName> and its affairs, Theodorus, I should ask you about things there and about the people, whether any of the young men there are devoting themselves to geometry or any other form of philosophy;  but as it is, since I care less for those people than for the people here, I am more eager to know which of our own young men are likely to gain reputation.  These are the things I myself investigate, so far as I can, and about which I question those others with whom I see that the young men like to associate.  Now a great many of them come to you, and rightly,
<milestone n="143e" unit="section"/>for you deserve it on account of your geometry, not to speak of other reasons.  So if you have met with any young man who is worth mentioning, I should like to hear about him.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theodorus</speaker><p>Truly, Socrates, it is well worth while for me to talk and for you to hear about a splendid young fellow, one of your fellow-citizens, whom I have met.  Now if he were handsome, I should be very much afraid to speak, lest someone should think I was in love with him.  But the fact is&mdash;now don't be angry with me&mdash;he is not handsome, but is like you in his snub nose and protruding eyes, only those features are less marked in him than in you. 
<milestone unit="page" n="144"/><milestone n="144a" unit="section"/>You see I speak fearlessly.  But I assure you that among all the young men I have ever met&mdash;and I have had to do with a great many&mdash;I never yet found one of such marvelously fine qualities.  He is quick to learn, beyond almost anyone else, yet exceptionally gentle, and moreover brave beyond any other;  I should not have supposed such a combination existed, and I do not see it elsewhere.  On the contrary, those who, like him, have quick, sharp minds and good memories, have usually also quick tempers;  they dart off and are swept away,
<milestone n="144b" unit="section"/>like ships without ballast;  they are excitable rather than courageous;  those, on the other hand, who are steadier are somewhat dull when brought face to face with learning, and are very forgetful.  But this boy advances toward learning and investigation smoothly and surely and successfully, with perfect gentleness, like a stream of oil that flows without a sound, so that one marvels how he accomplishes all this at his age.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>That is good news;  but which of our citizens is his father?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theodorus</speaker><p>I have heard the name, but do not remember it. 
<milestone n="144c" unit="section"/>However, it does not matter, for the youth is the middle one of those who are now coming toward us.  He and those friends of his were anointing themselves in the outer course,<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">The scene is evidently laid in a gymnasium;  the young men have been exercising.</note> and now they seem to have finished and to be coming here.  See if you recognize him.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Yes, I do.  He is the son of Euphronius of Sunium, who is a man of just the sort you describe, and of good repute in other respects;  moreover he left a very large property.  But the youth's name I do not know.
<milestone n="144d" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Theodorus</speaker><p>Theaetetus is his name, Socrates;  but I believe the property was squandered by trustees.  Nevertheless, Socrates, he is remarkably liberal with his money, too.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>It is a noble man that you describe.  Now please tell him to come here and sit by us.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theodorus</speaker><p>I will.  Theaetetus, come here to Socrates.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Yes, do so, Theaetetus, that I may look at myself and see what sort of a face I have; 
<milestone n="144e" unit="section"/>for Theodorus says it is like yours.  Now if we each had a lyre, and he said we had tuned them to the same key, should we take his word for it without more ado, or should we inquire first whether he who said it was a musician?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>We should inquire.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then if we found that he was a musician, we should believe him, but if not, we should refuse to take his word?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>But now, if we are concerned about the likeness of our faces,
<milestone unit="page" n="145"/><milestone n="145a" unit="section"/>we must consider whether he who speaks is a painter, or not.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>I think we must.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Well, is Theodorus a painter?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Not so far as I know.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Nor a geometrician, either?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Oh yes, decidedly, Socrates.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And an astronomer, and an arithmetician, and a musician, and in general an educated man?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>I think so.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Well then, if he says, either in praise or blame, that we have some physical resemblance, it is not especially worth while to pay attention to him.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Perhaps not.
<milestone n="145b" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>But what if he should praise the soul of one of us for virtue and wisdom?  Is it not worth while for the one who hears to examine eagerly the one who is praised, and for that one to exhibit his qualities with eagerness?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Certainly, Socrates.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then, my dear Theaetetus, this is just the time for you to exhibit your qualities and for me to examine them;  for I assure you that Theodorus, though he has praised many foreigners and citizens to me, never praised anyone as he praised you just now.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>A good idea, Socrates;  but make sure
<milestone n="145c" unit="section"/>that he was not speaking in jest.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>That is not Theodorus's way.  But do not seek to draw back from your agreement on the pretext that he is jesting, or he will be forced to testify under oath;  for certainly no one will accuse him of perjury.  Come, be courageous and hold to the agreement.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>I suppose I must, if you say so.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Now tell me;  I suppose you learn some geometry from Theodorus?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes.
<milestone n="145d" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And astronomy and harmony and arithmetic?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>I try hard to do so.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And so do I, my boy, from him and from any others who I think know anything about these things.  But nevertheless, although in other respects I get on fairly well in them, yet I am in doubt about one little matter, which should be investigated with your help and that of these others.  Tell me, is not learning growing wiser about that which one learns?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Of course.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And the wise, I suppose, are wise by wisdom.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes.
<milestone n="145e" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And does this differ at all from knowledge?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Does what differ?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Wisdom.  Or are not people wise in that of which they have knowledge?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Of course.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then knowledge and wisdom are the same thing?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Well, it is just this that I am in doubt about and cannot fully grasp by my own efforts&mdash;what knowledge really is. 
<milestone unit="page" n="146"/><milestone n="146a" unit="section"/>Can we tell that?  What do you say?  Who of us will speak first?  And he who fails, and whoever fails in turn, shall go and sit down and be donkey, as the children say when they play ball;  and whoever gets through without failing shall be our king and shall order us to answer any questions he pleases.  Why are you silent?  I hope, Theodorus, I am not rude, through my love of discussion and my eagerness to make us converse and show ourselves friends and ready to talk to one another.
<milestone n="146b" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Theodorus</speaker><p>That sort of thing would not be at all rude, Socrates;  but tell one of the youths to answer your questions;  for I am unused to such conversation and, moreover, I am not of an age to accustom myself to it.  But that would be fitting for these young men, and they would improve much more than I;  for the fact is, youth admits of improvement in every way.  Come, question Theaetetus as you began to do, and do not let him off.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Well, Theaetetus, you hear what Theodorus says,
<milestone n="146c" unit="section"/>and I think you will not wish to disobey him, nor is it right for a young person to disobey a wise man when he gives instructions about such matters.  Come, speak up well and nobly.  What do you think knowledge is?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Well, Socrates, I must, since you bid me.  For, if I make a mistake, you are sure to set me right.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Certainly, if we can.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Well then, I think the things one might learn from Theodorus are knowledge&mdash;geometry and all the things you spoke of just now&mdash;and also cobblery and
<milestone n="146d" unit="section"/>the other craftsmen's arts;  each and all of these are nothing else but knowledge.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>You are noble and generous, my friend, for when you are asked for one thing you give many, and a variety of things instead of a simple answer.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>What do you mean by that, Socrates?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Nothing, perhaps;  but I will tell you what I think I mean.  When you say &ldquo;cobblery&rdquo; you speak of nothing else than the art of making shoes, do you?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Nothing else.
<milestone n="146e" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And when you say &ldquo;carpentry&rdquo;?  Do you mean anything else than the art of making wooden furnishings?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Nothing else by that, either.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then in both cases you define that to which each form of knowledge belongs?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>But the question, Theaetetus, was not to what knowledge belongs, nor how many the forms of knowledge are;  for we did not wish to number them, but to find out what knowledge itself really is.  Or is there nothing in what I say?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Nay, you are quite right.
<milestone unit="page" n="147"/><milestone n="147a" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Take this example.  If anyone should ask us about some common everyday thing, for instance, what clay is, and we should reply that it is the potters' clay and the oven makers' clay and the brickmakers' clay, should we not be ridiculous?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Perhaps.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Yes in the first place for assuming that the questioner can understand from our answer what clay is, when we say &ldquo;clay,&rdquo; no matter whether we add &ldquo;the image-makers'&rdquo;
<milestone n="147b" unit="section"/>or any other craftsmen's.  Or does anyone, do you think, understand the name of anything when he does not know what the thing is?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>By no means.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then he does not understand knowledge of shoes if he does not know knowledge.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>No.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then he who is ignorant of knowledge does not understand cobblery or any other art.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>That is true.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then it is a ridiculous answer to the question &ldquo;what is knowledge?&rdquo; when we give the name of some art; 
<milestone n="147c" unit="section"/>for we give in our answer something that knowledge belongs to, when that was not what we were asked.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>So it seems.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Secondly, when we might have given a short, everyday answer, we go an interminable distance round;  for instance, in the question about clay, the everyday, simple thing would be to say &ldquo;clay is earth mixed with moisture&rdquo; without regard to whose clay it is.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>It seems easy just now, Socrates, as you put it;  but you are probably asking the kind of thing that came up among us lately when
<milestone n="147d" unit="section"/>your namesake, Socrates here, and I were talking together.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>What kind of thing was that, Theaetetus?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Theodorus here was drawing some figures for us in illustration of roots, showing that squares containing three square feet and five square feet are not commensurable in length with the unit of the foot, and so, selecting each one in its turn up to the square containing seventeen square feet and at that he stopped.  Now it occurred to us, since the number of roots appeared to be infinite, to try to collect them under one name,
<milestone n="147e" unit="section"/>by which we could henceforth call all the roots.<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">A simple form of the first statement would be:  the square roots of 3, 5, etc., are irrational numbers or surds.  The word <foreign lang="greek">DU/NAMIS</foreign> has not the meaning which we give in English to &ldquo;power,&rdquo; namely the result of multiplication of a number by itself, but that which we give to &ldquo;root,&rdquo; i.e. the number which, when multiplied by itself, produces a given result.  Here Theaetetus is speaking of square roots only;  and when he speaks of numbers and of equal factors he evidently thinks of rational whole numbers only, not of irrational numbers or fractions.  He is not giving an exhaustive presentation of his investigation, but merely a brief sketch of it to illustrate his understanding of the purpose of Socrates.  Toward the end of this sketch the word <foreign lang="greek">DU/NAMIS</foreign> is limited to the square roots of &ldquo;oblong&rdquo; numbers, i.e. to surds.  The modern reader may be somewhat confused because Theaetetus seems to speak of arithmetical facts in geometrical terms.  (Cf. Gow,  <title>Short History of Greek Mathematics</title>, p. 85.)</note></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And did you find such a name?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>I think we did.  But see if you agree.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Speak on.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>We divided all number into two classes.  The one, the numbers which can be formed by multiplying equal factors, we represented by the shape of the square and called square or equilateral numbers.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Well done!</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>The numbers between these, such as three
<milestone unit="page" n="148"/><milestone n="148a" unit="section"/>and five and all numbers which cannot be formed by multiplying equal factors, but only by multiplying a greater by a less or a less by a greater, and are therefore always contained in unequal sides, we represented by the shape of the oblong rectangle and called oblong numbers.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Very good;  and what next?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>All the lines which form the four sides of the equilateral or square numbers we called lengths, and those which form the oblong numbers we called surds, because they are not commensurable with the others
<milestone n="148b" unit="section"/>in length, but only in the areas of the planes which they have the power to form.  And similarly in the case of solids.<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">That is, cubes and cube roots.</note></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Most excellent, my boys!  I think Theodorus will not be found liable to an action for false witness.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>But really, Socrates, I cannot answer that question of yours about knowledge, as we answered the question about length and square roots.  And yet you seem to me to want something of that kind.  So Theodorus appears to be a false witness after all.
<milestone n="148c" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Nonsense!  If he were praising your running and said he had never met any young man who was so good a runner, and then you were beaten in a race by a full grown man who held the record, do you think his praise would be any less truthful?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Why, no.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And do you think that the discovery of knowledge, as I was just now saying, is a small matter and not a task for the very ablest men?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>By Zeus, I think it is a task for the very ablest.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then you must have confidence in yourself, and believe that Theodorus is right,
<milestone n="148d" unit="section"/>and try earnestly in every way to gain an understanding of the nature of knowledge as well as of other things.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>If it is a question of earnestness, Socrates, the truth will come to light.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Well then&mdash;for you pointed out the way admirably just now&mdash;take your answer about the roots as a model, and just as you embraced them all in one class, though they were many, try to designate the many forms of knowledge by one definition.
<milestone n="148e" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>But I assure you, Socrates, I have often tried to work that out, when I heard reports of the questions that you asked, but I can neither persuade myself that I have any satisfactory answer, nor can I find anyone else who gives the kind of answer you insist upon;  and yet, on the other hand, I cannot get rid of a feeling of concern about the matter.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Yes, you are suffering the pangs of labor, Theaetetus, because you are not empty, but pregnant.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>I do not know, Socrates;  I merely tell you what I feel.
<milestone unit="page" n="149"/><milestone n="149a" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Have you then not heard, you absurd boy, that I am the son of a noble and burly midwife, Phaenarete?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes, I have heard that.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And have you also heard that I practise the same art?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>No, never.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>But I assure you it is true;  only do not tell on me to the others;  for it is not known that I possess this art.  But other people, since they do not know it, do not say this of me, but say that I am a most eccentric person and drive men to distraction.  Have you heard that also?
<milestone n="149b" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes, I have.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Shall I tell you the reason then?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Oh yes, do.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Just take into consideration the whole business of the midwives, and you will understand more easily what I mean.  For you know, I suppose, that no one of them attends other women while she is still capable of conceiving and bearing but only those do so who have become too old to bear.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes, certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>They say the cause of this is Artemis, because she, a childless goddess, has had childbirth allotted to her as her special province.  Now it would seem she did not allow
<milestone n="149c" unit="section"/>barren women to be midwives, because human nature is too weak to acquire an art which deals with matters of which it has no experience, but she gave the office to those who on account of age were not bearing children, honoring them for their likeness to herself.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Very likely.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Is it not, then, also likely and even necessary, that midwives should know better than anyone else who are pregnant and who are not?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And furthermore, the midwives, by means of drugs
<milestone n="149d" unit="section"/>and incantations, are able to arouse the pangs of labor and, if they wish, to make them milder, and to cause those to bear who have difficulty in bearing;  and they cause miscarriages if they think them desirable.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>That is true.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Well, have you noticed this also about them, that they are the most skillful of matchmakers, since they are very wise in knowing what union of man and woman will produce the best possible children?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>I do not know that at all.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>But be assured that they are prouder of this
<milestone n="149e" unit="section"/>than of their skill in cutting the umbilical cord.  Just consider.  Do you think the knowledge of what soil is best for each plant or seed belongs to the same art as the tending and harvesting of the fruits of the earth, or to another?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>To the same art.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And in the case of a woman, do you think, my friend, that there is one art for the sowing and another for the harvesting?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>It is not likely.
<milestone unit="page" n="150"/><milestone n="150a" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>No;  but because there is a wrongful and unscientific way of bringing men and women together, which is called pandering, the midwives, since they are women of dignity and worth, avoid matchmaking, through fear of falling under the charge of pandering.  And yet the true midwife is the only proper match-maker.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>It seems so.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>So great, then, is the importance of midwives;  but their function is less important than mine.  For women do not, like my patients, bring forth
<milestone n="150b" unit="section"/>at one time real children and at another mere images which it is difficult to distinguish from the real.  For if they did, the greatest and noblest part of the work of the midwives would be in distinguishing between the real and the false.  Do you not think so?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes, I do.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>All that is true of their art of midwifery is true also of mine, but mine differs from theirs in being practised upon men, not women, and in tending their souls in labor, not their bodies.  But the greatest thing about my art is this,
<milestone n="150c" unit="section"/>that it can test in every way whether the mind of the young man is bringing forth a mere image, an imposture, or a real and genuine offspring.  For I have this in common with the midwives:  I am sterile in point of wisdom, and the reproach which has often been brought against me, that I question others but make no reply myself about anything, because I have no wisdom in me, is a true reproach;  and the reason of it is this:  the god compels me to act as midwife, but has never allowed me to bring forth.  I am, then, not at all a wise person myself,
<milestone n="150d" unit="section"/>nor have I any wise invention, the offspring born of my own soul;  but those who associate with me, although at first some of them seem very ignorant, yet, as our acquaintance advances, all of them to whom the god is gracious make wonderful progress, not only in their own opinion, but in that of others as well.  And it is clear that they do this, not because they have ever learned anything from me, but because they have found in themselves many fair things and have brought them forth.  But the delivery is due to the god and me.  And the proof of it is this:  many before now,
<milestone n="150e" unit="section"/>being ignorant of this fact and thinking that they were themselves the cause of their success, but despising me, have gone away from me sooner than they ought, whether of their own accord or because others persuaded them to do so.  Then, after they have gone away, they have miscarried thenceforth on account of evil companionship, and the offspring which they had brought forth through my assistance they have reared so badly that they have lost it;  they have considered impostures and images of more importance than the truth, and at last it was evident to themselves, as well as to others, that they were ignorant.  One of these was
<milestone unit="page" n="151"/><milestone n="151a" unit="section"/>Aristeides, the son of Lysimachus, and there are very many more.  When such men come back and beg me, as they do, with wonderful eagerness to let them join me again, the spiritual monitor that comes to me forbids me to associate with some of them, but allows me to converse with others, and these again make progress.  Now those who associate with me are in this matter also like women in childbirth;  they are in pain and are full of trouble night and day, much more than are the women;  and my art can arouse this pain and cause it to cease.  Well, that is what happens to them. 
<milestone n="151b" unit="section"/>But in some cases, Theaetetus, when they do not seem to me to be exactly pregnant, since I see that they have no need of me, I act with perfect goodwill as match-maker and, under God, I guess very successfully with whom they can associate profitably, and I have handed over many of them to Prodicus, and many to other wise and inspired men. Now I have said all this to you at such length, my dear boy, because I suspect that you, as you yourself believe, are in pain because you are pregnant with something within you.  Apply, then, to me, remembering that I am the son of a midwife
<milestone n="151c" unit="section"/>and have myself a midwife's gifts, and do your best to answer the questions I ask as I ask them.  And if, when I have examined any of the things you say, it should prove that I think it is a mere image and not real, and therefore quietly take it from you and throw it away, do not be angry as women are when they are deprived of their first offspring.  For many, my dear friend, before this have got into such a state of mind towards me that they are actually ready to bite me, if I take some foolish notion away from them, and they do not believe that I do this in kindness,
<milestone n="151d" unit="section"/>since they are far from knowing that no god is unkind to mortals, and that I do nothing of this sort from unkindness, either, and that it is quite out of the question for me to allow an imposture or to destroy the true.  And so, Theaetetus, begin again and try to tell us what knowledge is.  And never say that you are unable to do so;  for if God wills it and gives you courage, you will be able.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Well then, Socrates, since you are so urgent it would be disgraceful for anyone not to exert himself in every way
<milestone n="151e" unit="section"/>to say what he can.  I think, then, that he who knows anything perceives that which he knows, and, as it appears at present, knowledge is nothing else than perception.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Good!  Excellent, my boy!  That is the way one ought to speak out.  But come now, let us examine your utterance together, and see whether it is a real offspring or a mere wind-egg.  Perception, you say, is knowledge?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And, indeed, if I may venture to say so, it is not a bad description of knowledge
<milestone unit="page" n="152"/><milestone n="152a" unit="section"/>that you have given, but one which Protagoras also used to give.  Only, he has said the same thing in a different way.  For he says somewhere that man is &ldquo;the measure of all things, of the existence of the things that are and the non-existence of the things that are not.&rdquo;  You have read that, I suppose?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes, I have read it often.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Well, is not this about what he means, that individual things are for me such as they appear to me, and for you in turn such as they appear to you &mdash;you and I being &ldquo;man&rdquo;?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes, that is what he says.
<milestone n="152b" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>It is likely that a wise man is not talking nonsense;  so let us follow after him.  Is it not true that sometimes, when the same wind blows, one of us feels cold, and the other does not?  or one feels slightly and the other exceedingly cold?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then in that case, shall we say that the wind is in itself cold or not cold or shall we accept Protagoras's saying that it is cold for him who feels cold and not for him who does not?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Apparently we shall accept that.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then it also seems cold, or not, to each of the two?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>But &ldquo;seems&rdquo; denotes perceiving?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>It does.
<milestone n="152c" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then seeming and perception are the same thing in matters of warmth and everything of that sort.  For as each person perceives things, such they are to each person.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Apparently.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Perception, then, is always of that which exists and, since it is knowledge, cannot be false.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>So it seems.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>By the Graces!  I wonder if Protagoras, who was a very wise man, did not utter this dark saying to the common herd like ourselves, and tell the truth<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">An allusion to the title of Protagoras's book, <title>Truth</title>.</note> in secret to his pupils.
<milestone n="152d" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Why, Socrates, what do you mean by that?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>I will tell you and it is not a bad description, either, that nothing is one and invariable, and you could not rightly ascribe any quality whatsoever to anything, but if you call it large it will also appear to be small, and light if you call it heavy, and everything else in the same way, since nothing whatever is one, either a particular thing or of a particular quality;  but it is out of movement and motion and mixture with one another that all those things become which we wrongly say &ldquo;are&rdquo;&mdash;wrongly, because nothing ever is, but is always becoming. 
    <milestone n="152e" unit="section"/>And on this subject all the philosophers, except Parmenides, may be marshalled in one line&mdash;Protagoras and Heracleitus and Empedocles&mdash;and the chief poets in the two kinds of poetry, Epicharmus, in comedy, and in tragedy, Homer, who, in the line<quote type="verse"><l met="dactylic">0ceanus the origin of the gods, and Tethys their mother,</l></quote><bibl n="Hom. Il. 14.201">Hom. Il. 14.201, 302</bibl>has said that all things are the offspring of flow and motion;  or don't you think he means that?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>I think he does.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then who could still contend with such a great host,
<milestone unit="page" n="153"/><milestone n="153a" unit="section"/>led by Homer as general, and not make himself ridiculous?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>It is not easy, Socrates.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>No, Theaetetus, it is not.  For the doctrine is amply proved by this, namely, that motion is the cause of that which passes for existence, that is, of becoming, whereas rest is the cause of non-existence and destruction;  for warmth or fire, which, you know, is the parent and preserver of all other things, is itself the offspring of movement and friction, and these two are forms of motion.  Or are not these the source of fire?
<milestone n="153b" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes, they are.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And furthermore, the animal kingdom is sprung from these same sources.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Of course.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Well, then, is not the bodily habit destroyed by rest and idleness, and preserved, generally speaking, by gymnastic exercises and motions?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And what of the habit of the soul?  Does not the soul acquire information and is it not preserved and made better through learning and practice, which are motions, whereas through rest, which is want of practice and of study,
<milestone n="153c" unit="section"/>it learns nothing and forgets what it has learned?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then the good, both for the soul and for the body, is motion, and rest is the opposite?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Apparently.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Now shall I go on and mention to you also windless air, calm sea, and all that sort of thing, and say that stillness causes decay and destruction and that the opposite brings preservation?  And shall I add to this the all-compelling and crowning argument that Homer by &ldquo;the golden chain&rdquo;<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb"><bibl n="Hom. Il. 8.18">Hom. Il. 8.18 ff.</bibl> especially 26.  In this passage Zeus declares that all the gods and goddesses together could not, with a golden chain, drag him from on high, but that if he pulled, he would drag them, with earth and sea, would then bind the chain round the summit of <placeName key="tgn,7011019">Olympus</placeName>, and all the rest would hang aloft.  This &ldquo;crowning argument&rdquo; is a <title>reductio ad absurdum</title>of the habit of using texts from Homer in support of all kinds of doctrine.</note> refers to nothing else than the sun,
<milestone n="153d" unit="section"/>and means that so long as the heavens and the sun go round everything exists and is preserved, among both gods and men, but if the motion should stop, as if bound fast, everything would be destroyed and would, as the saying is, be turned upside down?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes, Socrates, I think he means what you say he does.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then, my friend, you must apply the doctrine in this way:  first as concerns vision, the color that you call white is not to be taken as something separate outside of your eyes, nor yet as something inside of them;  and you must not assign any place to it,
<milestone n="153e" unit="section"/>for then it would at once be in a definite position and stationary and would have no part in the process of becoming.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>But what do you mean?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Let us stick close to the statement we made a moment ago, and assume that nothing exists by itself as invariably one:  then it will be apparent that black or white or any other color whatsoever is the result of the impact of the eye upon the appropriate motion, and therefore that which we call color
<milestone unit="page" n="154"/><milestone n="154a" unit="section"/>will be in each instance neither that which impinges nor that which is impinged upon, but something between, which has occurred, peculiar to each individual.  Or would you maintain that each color appears to a dog, or any other animal you please, just as it does to you?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>No, by Zeus, I wouldn't.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Well, does anything whatsoever appear the same to any other man as to you?  Are you sure of this?  Or are you not much more convinced that nothing appears the same even to you, because you yourself are never exactly the same?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes, I am much more convinced of the last.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then, if that with which I compare myself in size, or which I touch,
<milestone n="154b" unit="section"/>were really large or white or hot, it would never have become different by coming in contact with something different, without itself changing;  and if, on the other hand, that which did the comparing or the touching were really large or white or hot, it would not have become different when something different approached it or was affected in some way by it, without being affected in some way itself.  For nowadays, my friend, we find ourselves rather easily forced to make extraordinary and absurd statements, as Protagoras and everyone who undertakes to agree with him would say.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>What do you mean?  What statements?
<milestone n="154c" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Take a little example and you will know all I have in mind.  Given six dice, for instance, if you compare four with them, we say that they are more than the four, half as many again, but if you compare twelve with them, we say they are less, half as many;  and any other statement would be inadmissible;  or would you admit any other?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Not I.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Well then, if Protagoras, or anyone else, ask you, &ldquo;Theaetetus, can anything become greater or more in any other way than by being increased?&rdquo; what reply will you make?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>If I am to say what I think, Socrates, with reference to
<milestone n="154d" unit="section"/>the present question, I should say &ldquo;no,&rdquo; but if I consider the earlier question, I should say &ldquo;yes,&rdquo; for fear of contradicting myself.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Good, by Hera!

<milestone n="154e" unit="section"/>rushing together like sophists in a sophistical combat, battering each other's arguments with counter arguments.  But, as it is, since we are ordinary people, we shall wish in the first place to look into the real essence of our thoughts and see whether they harmonize with one another or not at all.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Certainly that is what I should like.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And so should I.  But since this is the case, and we have plenty of time, shall we not quietly, without any impatience, but truly examining ourselves,
<milestone unit="page" n="155"/><milestone n="155a" unit="section"/>consider again the nature of these appearances within us?  And as we consider them, I shall say, I think, first, that nothing can ever become more or less in size or number, so long as it remains equal to itself.  Is it not so?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And secondly, that anything to which nothing is added and from which nothing is subtracted, is neither increased nor diminished, but is always equal.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Certainly.
<milestone n="155b" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And should we not say thirdly, that what was not previously could not afterwards be without becoming and having become?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes, I agree.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>These three assumptions contend with one another in our minds when we talk about the dice, or when we say that I, who do not, at my age, either increase in size or diminish, am in the course of a year first larger than you, who are young, and afterwards smaller, when nothing has been taken from my size,
<milestone n="155c" unit="section"/>but you have grown.  For I am, it seems, afterwards what I was not before, and I have not become so;  for it is impossible to have become without becoming, and without losing anything of my size I could not become smaller.  And there are countless myriads of such contradictions, if we are to accept these that I have mentioned.  You follow me, I take it, Theaetetus, for I think you are not new at such things.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>By the gods, Socrates, I am lost in wonder when I think of all these things, and sometimes when I regard them it really makes my head swim.
<milestone n="155d" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Theodorus seems to be a pretty good guesser about your nature.  For this feeling of wonder shows that you are a philosopher, since wonder is the only beginning of philosophy, and he who said that Iris was the child of Thaumas<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb"><bibl n="Hes. Th. 750.">Hes. Theog. 750</bibl>  Iris is the messenger of heaven, and Plato interprets the name of her father as &ldquo;Wonder&rdquo; (<foreign lang="greek">QAU=MA</foreign>).</note> made a good genealogy.  But do you begin to understand why these things are so, according to the doctrine we attribute to Protagoras, or do you not as yet?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Not yet, I think.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And will you be grateful to me if I help you
<milestone n="155e" unit="section"/>to search out the hidden truth of the thought of a famous man or, I should say, of famous men?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Of course I shall be grateful, very grateful.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Look round and see that none of the uninitiated is listening.  The uninitiated are those who think nothing is except what they can grasp firmly with their hands, and who deny the existence of actions and generation and all that is invisible.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Truly, Socrates, those you speak of are very stubborn
<milestone unit="page" n="156"/><milestone n="156a" unit="section"/>and perverse mortals.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>So they are, my boy, quite without culture.  But others are more clever, whose secret doctrines I am going to disclose to you.  For them the beginning, upon which all the things we were just now speaking of depend, is the assumption that everything is real motion and that there is nothing besides this, but that there are two kinds of motion, each infinite in the number of its manifestations, and of these kinds one has an active, the other a passive force.  From the union and friction of these two are born offspring, infinite in number, but always twins, the object of sense
<milestone n="156b" unit="section"/>and the sense which is always born and brought forth together with the object of sense.  Now we give the senses names like these:  sight and hearing and smell, and the sense of cold and of heat, and pleasures and pains and desires and fears and so forth.  Those that have names are very numerous, and those that are unnamed are innumerable.  Now the class of objects of sense is akin to each of these;  all sorts of colors are akin to all sorts of acts of vision, and in the same way sounds to acts of hearing,
<milestone n="156c" unit="section"/>and the other objects of sense spring forth akin to the other senses.  What does this tale mean for us, Theaetetus, with reference to what was said before?  Do you see?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Not quite, Socrates.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Just listen;  perhaps we can finish the tale.  It means, of course, that all these things are, as we were saying, in motion, and their motion has in it either swiftness or slowness.  Now the slow element keeps its motion in the same place and directed towards such things as draw near it, and indeed it is in this way that it begets. 
<milestone n="156d" unit="section"/>But the things begotten in this way are quicker;  for they move from one place to another, and their motion is naturally from one place to another.  Now when the eye and some appropriate object which approaches beget whiteness and the corresponding perception&mdash;which could never have been produced by either of them going to anything else&mdash;then, while sight from the eye and
<milestone n="156e" unit="section"/>whiteness from that which helps to produce the color are moving from one to the other, the eye becomes full of sight and so begins at that moment to see, and becomes, certainly not sight, but a seeing eye, and the object which joined in begetting the color is filled with whiteness and becomes in its turn, not whiteness, but white, whether it be a stick or a stone, or whatever it be the hue of which is so colored.  And all the rest&mdash;hard and hot and so forth&mdash;must be regarded in the same way:  we must assume,
<milestone unit="page" n="157"/><milestone n="157a" unit="section"/>we said before, that nothing exists in itself, but all things of all sorts arise out of motion by intercourse with each other;  for it is, as they say, impossible to form a firm conception of the active or the passive element as being anything separately;  for there is no active element until there is a union with the passive element, nor is there a passive element until there is a union with the active;  and that which unites with one thing is active and appears again as passive when it comes in contact with something else.  And so it results from all this, as we said in the beginning, that nothing exists as invariably one, itself by itself, but everything is always becoming in relation to something, and &ldquo;being&rdquo; should be altogether abolished,
<milestone n="157b" unit="section"/>though we have often&mdash;and even just now&mdash;been compelled by custom and ignorance to use the word.  But we ought not, the wise men say, to permit the use of &ldquo;something&rdquo; or &ldquo;somebody's&rdquo; or &ldquo;mine&rdquo; or &ldquo;this&rdquo; or &ldquo;that&rdquo; or any other word that implies making things stand still, but in accordance with nature we should speak of things as &ldquo;becoming&rdquo; and &ldquo;being made&rdquo; and &ldquo;being destroyed&rdquo; and &ldquo;changing&rdquo;;  for anyone who by his mode of speech makes things stand still is easily refuted.  And we must use such expressions in relation both to particular objects and collective designations, among which are
<milestone n="157c" unit="section"/>&ldquo;mankind&rdquo; and &ldquo;stone&rdquo; and the names of every animal and class.  Do these doctrines seem pleasant to you, Theaetetus, and do you find their taste agreeable?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>I don't know, Socrates;  besides, I can't tell about you, either, whether you are preaching them because you believe them or to test me.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>You forget, my friend, that I myself know nothing about such things, and claim none of them as mine, but am incapable of bearing them and am merely acting as a midwife to you, and for that reason am uttering incantations and giving you a taste of each of the philosophical theories,
<milestone n="157d" unit="section"/>until I may help to bring your own opinion to light.  And when it is brought to light, I will examine it and see whether it is a mere wind-egg or a real offspring.  So be brave and patient, and in good and manly fashion tell what you think in reply to my questions.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Very well;  ask them.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then say once more whether the doctrine pleases you that nothing is, but is always becoming&mdash;good or beautiful or any of the other qualities we were just enumerating.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Why, when I hear you telling about it as you did, it seems to me that it is wonderfully reasonable and ought to be accepted as you have presented it.
<milestone n="157e" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Let us, then, not neglect a point in which it is defective.  The defect is found in connection with dreams and diseases, including insanity, and everything else that is said to cause illusions of sight and hearing and the other senses.  For of course you know that in all these the doctrine we were just presenting seems admittedly to be refuted, because
<milestone unit="page" n="158"/><milestone n="158a" unit="section"/>in them we certainly have false perceptions, and it is by no means true that everything is to each man which appears to him;  on the contrary, nothing is which appears.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>What you say is very true, Socrates.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>What argument is left, then, my boy, for the man who says that perception is knowledge and that in each case the things which appear are to the one to whom they appear?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>I hesitate to say, Socrates, that I have no reply to make, because you scolded me just now when I said that. 
<milestone n="158b" unit="section"/>But really I cannot dispute that those who are insane or dreaming have false opinions, when some of them think they are gods and others fancy in their sleep that they have wings and are flying.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Don't you remember, either, the similar dispute about these errors, especially about sleeping and waking?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>What dispute?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>One which I fancy you have often heard.  The question is asked, what proof you could give if anyone should ask us now, at the present moment, whether we are asleep and our thoughts are a dream, or whether we are awake
<milestone n="158c" unit="section"/>and talking with each other in a waking condition.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Really, Socrates, I don't see what proof can be given;  for there is an exact correspondence in all particulars, as between the strophe and antistrophe of a choral song.  Take, for instance, the conversation we have just had:  there is nothing to prevent us from imagining in our sleep also that we are carrying on this conversation with each other, and when in a dream we imagine that we are relating dreams, the likeness between the one talk and the other is remarkable.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>So you see it is not hard to dispute the point, since it is even open to dispute whether we are awake or in a dream. 
<milestone n="158d" unit="section"/>Now since the time during which we are asleep is equal to that during which we are awake, in each state our spirit contends that the semblances that appear to it at any time are certainly true, so that for half the time we say that this is true, and for half the time the other, and we maintain each with equal confidence.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And may not, then, the same be said about insanity and the other diseases, except that the time is not equal?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Well, then, shall truth be determined by the length or shortness of time?
<milestone n="158e" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>That would be absurd in many ways.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>But can you show clearly in any other way which of the two sets of opinions is true?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>I do not think I can.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Listen, then, while I tell you what would be said about them by those who maintain that what appears at any time is true for him to whom it appears.  They begin, I imagine, by asking this question:  &ldquo;Theaetetus, can that which is wholly other have in any way the same quality as its alternative?  And we must not assume that the thing in question is partially the same and partially other, but wholly other.&rdquo;</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>It is impossible for it to be the same in anything, either in quality

<milestone n="159b" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Well, then, let us take me, or you, or anything else at hand, and apply the same principle&mdash;say Socrates in health and Socrates in illness.  Shall we say the one is like the other, or unlike?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>When you say &ldquo;Socrates in illness&rdquo; do you mean to compare that Socrates as a whole with Socrates in health as a whole?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>You understand perfectly;  that is just what I mean.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Unlike, I imagine.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And therefore other, inasmuch as unlike?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Necessarily.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And you would say the same of Socrates asleep or in any of the other states
<milestone n="159c" unit="section"/>we enumerated just now?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then each of those elements which by the law of their nature act upon something else, will, when it gets hold of Socrates in health, find me one object to act upon, and when it gets hold of me in illness, another?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>How can it help it?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And so, in the two cases, that active element and I, who am the passive element, shall each produce a different object?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Of course.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>So, then, when I am in health and drink wine, it seems pleasant and sweet to me?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>The reason is, in fact, that according to the principles we accepted a while ago,
<milestone n="159d" unit="section"/>the active and passive elements produce sweetness and perception, both of which are simultaneously moving from one place to another, and the perception, which comes from the passive element, makes the tongue perceptive, and the sweetness, which comes from the wine and pervades it, passes over and makes the wine both to be and to seem sweet to the tongue that is in health.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Certainly, such are the principles we accepted a while ago.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>But when it gets hold of me in illness, in the first place, it really doesn't get hold of the same man, does it?  For he to whom it comes is certainly unlike.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>True.
<milestone n="159e" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Therefore the union of the Socrates who is ill and the draught of wine produces other results:  in the tongue the sensation or perception of bitterness, and in the wine&mdash;a bitterness which is engendered there and passes over into the other;  the wine is made, not bitterness, but bitter, and I am made, not perception, but perceptive.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then I shall never have this perception of any other thing;  for a perception of another thing is another perception,
<milestone unit="page" n="160"/><milestone n="160a" unit="section"/>and makes the percipient different and other:  nor can that which acts on me ever by union with another produce the same result or become the same in kind;  for by producing another result from another passive element it will become different in kind.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>That is true.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And neither shall I, furthermore, ever again become the same as I am, nor will that ever become the same as it is.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>No.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And yet, when I become percipient, I must necessarily become percipient of something, for it is impossible to become percipient and perceive nothing;  and that which is perceived must become so to someone,
<milestone n="160b" unit="section"/>when it becomes sweet or bitter or the like;  for to become sweet, but sweet to no one, is impossible.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Perfectly true.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>The result, then, I think, is that we (the active and the passive elements) are or become, whichever is the case, in relation to one another, since we are bound to one another by the inevitable law of our being, but to nothing else, not even to ourselves.  The result, then, is that we are bound to one another;  and so if a man says anything &ldquo;is,&rdquo; he must say it is to or of or in relation to something, and similarly if he says it &ldquo;becomes&rdquo;;  but he must not say
<milestone n="160c" unit="section"/>it is or becomes absolutely, nor can he accept such a statement from anyone else.  That is the meaning of the doctrine we have been describing.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes, quite so, Socrates.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then, since that which acts on me is to me and to me only, it is also the case that I perceive it, and I only?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Of course.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then to me my perception is true;  for in each case it is always part of my being;  and I am, as Protagoras says, the judge of the existence of the things that are to me and of the non-existence of those that are not to me.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>So it seems.
<milestone n="160d" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>How, then, if I am an infallible judge and my mind never stumbles in regard to the things that are or that become, can I fail to know that which I perceive?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>You cannot possibly fail.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Therefore you were quite right in saying that knowledge is nothing else than perception, and there is complete identity between the doctrine of Homer and Heracleitus and all their followers&mdash;that all things are in motion, like streams&mdash;the doctrine of the great philosopher Protagoras that man is the measure of all things&mdash;and the doctrine of Theaetetus that,
<milestone n="160e" unit="section"/>since these things are true, perception is knowledge.  Eh, Theaetetus?  Shall we say that this is, so to speak, your new-born child and the result of my midwifery?  Or what shall we say?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>We must say that, Socrates.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Well, we have at last managed to bring this forth, whatever it turns out to be;  and now that it is born, we must in very truth perform the rite of running round with it in a circle&mdash;<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">The rite called <title>amphidromia</title>took place a few days after the birth of a child.  After some ceremonies of purification the nurse, in the presence of the family, carried the infant rapidly about the family hearth, thereby introducing him, as it were, to the family and the family deities.  At this time the father decided whether to bring up the child or to expose it.  Sometimes, perhaps, the child was named on this occasion.  In the evening relatives assembled for a feast at which shell-fish were eaten.</note> the circle of our argument&mdash;and see whether it may not turn out to be after all not worth rearing, but only a wind-egg,
<milestone unit="page" n="161"/><milestone n="161a" unit="section"/>an imposture.  But, perhaps, you think that any offspring of yours ought to be cared for and not put away;  or will you bear to see it examined and not get angry if it is taken away from you, though it is your first-born?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theodorus</speaker><p>Theaetetus will bear it, Socrates, for he is not at all ill-tempered.  But for heaven's sake, Socrates, tell me, is all this wrong after all?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>You are truly fond of argument, Theodorus, and a very good fellow to think that I am a sort of bag full of arguments and can easily pull one out and say that after all the other one was wrong; 
<milestone n="161b" unit="section"/>but you do not understand what is going on:  none of the arguments comes from me, but always from him who is talking with me.  I myself know nothing, except just a little, enough to extract an argument from another man who is wise and to receive it fairly.  And now I will try to extract this thought from Theaetetus, but not to say anything myself.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theodorus</speaker><p>That is the better way, Socrates;  do as you say.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Do you know, then, Theodorus, what amazes me in your friend Protagoras?
<milestone n="161c" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Theodorus</speaker><p>What is it?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>In general I like his doctrine that what appears to each one is to him, but I am amazed by the beginning of his book.  I don't see why he does not say in the beginning of his <title>Truth</title><note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb"><title>Truth</title>was apparently the title, or part of the title, of Protagoras's book.</note> that a pig or a dog-faced baboon or some still stranger creature of those that have sensations is the measure of all things.  Then he might have begun to speak to us very imposingly and condescendingly, showing that while we were honoring him like a god for his wisdom, he was after all no better in intellect than any other man,
<milestone n="161d" unit="section"/>or, for that matter, than a tadpole.  What alternative is there, Theodorus?  For if that opinion is true to each person which he acquires through sensation, and no one man can discern another's condition better than he himself, and one man has no better right to investigate whether another's opinion is true or false than he himself, but, as we have said several times, each man is to form his own opinions by himself, and these opinions are always right and true, why in the world, my friend, was Protagoras wise, so that he could rightly be thought worthy
<milestone n="161e" unit="section"/>to be the teacher of other men and to be well paid, and why were we ignorant creatures and obliged to go to school to him, if each person is the measure of his own wisdom?  Must we not believe that Protagoras was &ldquo;playing to the gallery&rdquo; in saying this?  I say nothing of the ridicule that I and my science of midwifery deserve in that case,&mdash;and, I should say, the whole practice of dialectics, too.  For would not the investigation of one another's fancies and opinions, and the attempt to refute them, when each man's must be right, be tedious
<milestone unit="page" n="162"/><milestone n="162a" unit="section"/>and blatant folly, if the  <title>Truth</title> of Protagoras is true and he was not jesting when he uttered his oracles from the shrine of his book?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theodorus</speaker><p>Socrates, the man was my friend, as you just remarked.  So I should hate to bring about the refutation of Protagoras by agreeing with you, and I should hate also to oppose you contrary to my real convictions.  So take Theaetetus again;  especially as he seemed just now to follow your suggestions very carefully.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>If you went to <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>, Theodorus,
<milestone n="162b" unit="section"/>and visited the wrestling-schools, would you think it fair to look on at other people naked, some of whom were of poor physique, without stripping and showing your own form, too?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theodorus</speaker><p>Why not, if I could persuade them to allow me to do so?  So now I think I shall persuade you to let me be a spectator, and not to drag me into the ring, since I am old and stiff, but to take the younger and nimbler man as your antagonist.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Well, Theodorus, if that pleases you,
<milestone n="162c" unit="section"/>it does not displease me, as the saying is.  So I must attack the wise Theaetetus again.  Tell me, Theaetetus, referring to the doctrine we have just expounded, do you not share my amazement at being suddenly exalted to an equality with the wisest man, or even god?  Or do you think Protagoras's &ldquo;measure&rdquo; applies any less to gods than to men?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>By no means;  and I am amazed that you ask such a question at all;  for when we were discussing the meaning of the doctrine
<milestone n="162d" unit="section"/>that whatever appears to each one really is to him, I thought it was good;  but now it has suddenly changed to the opposite.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>You are young, my dear boy;  so you are quickly moved and swayed by popular oratory.  For in reply to what I have said, Protagoras, or someone speaking for him, will say, &ldquo;Excellent boys and old men, there you sit together declaiming to the people, and you bring in the gods, the question of whose
<milestone n="162e" unit="section"/>existence or non-existence I exclude from oral and written discussion, and you say the sort of thing that the crowd would readily accept&mdash;that it is a terrible thing if every man is to be no better than any beast in point of wisdom;  but you do not advance any cogent proof whatsoever;  you base your statements on probability.  If Theodorus, or any other geometrician, should base his geometry on probability, he would be of no account at all.  So you and Theodorus had better consider whether you will accept arguments founded on plausibility and probabilities in
<milestone unit="page" n="163"/><milestone n="163a" unit="section"/>such important matters.&rdquo;</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>That would not be right, Socrates;  neither you nor we would think so.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Apparently, then, you and Theodorus mean we must look at the matter in a different way.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes, certainly in a different way.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Well, then, let us look at it in this way, raising the question whether knowledge is after all the same as perception, or different.  For that is the object of all our discussion, and it was to answer that question than we stirred up all these strange doctrines, was it not?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Most assuredly.
<milestone n="163b" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Shall we then agree that all that we perceive by sight or hearing we know?  For instance, shall we say that before having learned the language of foreigners we do not hear them when they speak, or that we both hear and know what they say?  And again, if we do not know the letters, shall we maintain that we do not see them when we look at them or that if we really see them we know them?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>We shall say, Socrates, that we know just so much of them as we hear or see:  in the case of the letters, we both see and know the form and color,
<milestone n="163c" unit="section"/>and in the spoken language we both hear and at the same time know the higher and lower notes of the voice;  but we do not perceive through sight or hearing, and we do not know, what the grammarians and interpreters teach about them.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>First-rate, Theaetetus!  and it is a pity to dispute that, for I want you to grow.  But look out for another trouble that is yonder coming towards us, and see how we can repel it.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>What is it?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>It is like this:  If anyone should ask, &ldquo;Is it possible, if a man has ever known a thing and still has
<milestone n="163d" unit="section"/>and preserves a memory of that thing, that he does not, at the time when he remembers, know that very thing which he remembers?&rdquo;  I seem to be pretty long winded;  but I merely want to ask if a man who has learned a thing does not know it when he remembers it.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Of course he does, Socrates;  for what you suggest would be monstrous.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Am I crazy, then?  Look here.  Do you not say that seeing is perceiving and that sight is perception?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>I do.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then, according to what we have just said, the man who has seen a thing has acquired knowledge
<milestone n="163e" unit="section"/>of that which he has seen?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Well, then, do you not admit that there is such a thing as memory?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Memory of nothing or of something?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Of something, surely.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Of things he has learned and perceived&mdash;that sort of things?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Of course.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>A man sometimes remembers what he has seen, does he not?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>He does.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Even when he shuts his eyes, or does he forget if he does that?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>It would be absurd to say that, Socrates.
<milestone unit="page" n="164"/><milestone n="164a" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>We must, though, if we are to maintain our previous argument;  otherwise, it is all up with it.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>I too, by Zeus, have my suspicions, but I don't fully understand you.  Tell me how it is.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>This is how it is:  he who sees has acquired knowledge, we say, of that which he has seen;  for it is agreed that sight and perception and knowledge are all the same.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>But he who has seen and has acquired knowledge of what he saw, if he shuts his eyes, remembers it, but does not see it.  Is that right?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes.
<milestone n="164b" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>But &ldquo;does not see&rdquo; is the same as &ldquo;does not know,&rdquo; if it is true that seeing is knowing.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>True.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then this is our result.  When a man has acquired knowledge of a thing and still remembers it, he does not know it, since he does not see it;  but we said that would be a monstrous conclusion.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Very true.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>So, evidently, we reach an impossible result if we say that knowledge and perception are the same.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>So it seems.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then we must say they are different.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>I suppose so.
<milestone n="164c" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then what can knowledge be?  We must, apparently, begin our discussion all over again.  And yet, Theaetetus, what are we on the point of doing?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>About what?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>It seems to me that we are behaving like a worthless game-cock;  before winning the victory we have leapt away from our argument and begun to crow.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>How so?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>We seem to be acting like professional debaters;  we have based our agreements on the mere similarity of words and are satisfied to have got the better of the argument in such a way, and we do not see that we, who claim to be, not contestants for a prize, but lovers of wisdom,
<milestone n="164d" unit="section"/>are doing just what those ingenious persons do.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>I do not yet understand what you mean.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Well, I will try to make my thought clear.  We asked, you recollect, whether a man who has learned something and remembers it does not know it.  We showed first that the one who has seen and then shuts his eyes remembers, although he does not see, and then we showed that he does not know, although at the same time he remembers;  but this, we said, was impossible.  And so the Protagorean tale was brought to naught, and yours also about the identity of knowledge and perception.
<milestone n="164e" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Evidently.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>It would not be so, I fancy, my friend, if the father of the first of the two tales were alive;  he would have had a good deal to say in its defence.  But he is dead, and we are abusing the orphan.  Why, even the guardians whom Protagoras left&mdash;one of whom is Theodorus here&mdash;are unwilling to come to the child's assistance.  So it seems that we shall have to do it ourselves, assisting him in the name of justice.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theodorus</speaker><p>Do so, for it is not I, Socrates, but rather
<milestone unit="page" n="165"/><milestone n="165a" unit="section"/>Callias the son of Hipponicus, who is the guardian of his children.  As for me, I turned rather too soon from abstract speculations to geometry.  However, I shall be grateful to you if you come to his assistance.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Good, Theodorus!  Now see how I shall help him;  for a man might find himself involved in still worse inconsistencies than those in which we found ourselves just now, if he did not pay attention to the terms which we generally use in assent and denial.  Shall I explain this to you, or only to Theaetetus?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theodorus</speaker><p>To both of us, but let the younger answer; 
<milestone n="165b" unit="section"/>for he will be less disgraced if he is discomfited.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Very well;  now I am going to ask the most frightfully difficult question of all.  It runs, I believe, something like this:  Is it possible for a person, if he knows a thing, at the same time not to know that which he knows?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theodorus</speaker><p>Now, then, what shall we answer, Theaetetus?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>It is impossible, I should think.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Not if you make seeing and knowing identical.  For what will you do with a question from which there is no escape, by which you are, as the saying is, caught in a pit, when your adversary, unabashed, puts his hand over one of your eyes and asks
<milestone n="165c" unit="section"/>if you see his cloak with the eye that is covered?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>I shall say, I think, &ldquo;Not with that eye, but with the other.&rdquo;</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then you see and do not see the same thing at the same time?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>After a fashion.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; he will reply, &ldquo;is not at all what I want, and I did not ask about the fashion, but whether you both know and do not know the same thing.  Now manifestly you see that which you do not see.  But you have agreed that seeing is knowing and not seeing is not knowing.  Very well;  from all this, reckon out what the result is.&rdquo;
<milestone n="165d" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Well, I reckon out that the result is the contrary of my hypothesis.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And perhaps, my fine fellow, more troubles of the same sort might have come upon you, if anyone asked you further questions&mdash;whether it is possible to know the same thing both sharply and dully, to know close at hand but not at a distance, to know both violently and gently, and countless other questions, such as a nimble fighter, fighting for pay in the war of words, might have lain in wait and asked you, when you said that knowledge and perception were the same thing;  he would have charged down upon hearing and smelling and such senses,
<milestone n="165e" unit="section"/>and would have argued persistently and unceasingly until you were filled with admiration of his greatly desired wisdom and were taken in his toils, and then, after subduing and binding you he would at once proceed to bargain with you for such ransom as might be agreed upon between you.  What argument, then, you might ask, will Protagoras produce to strengthen his forces?  Shall we try to carry on the discussion?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>By all means.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>He will, I fancy, say all that we have said in his defence
<milestone unit="page" n="166"/><milestone n="166a" unit="section"/>and then will close with us, saying contemptuously, &ldquo;Our estimable Socrates here frightened a little boy by asking if it was possible for one and the same person to remember and at the same time not to know one and the same thing, and when the child in his fright said 'no,' because he could not foresee what would result, Socrates made poor me a laughing-stock in his talk.  But, you slovenly Socrates, the facts stand thus:  when you examine any doctrine of mine by the method of questioning, if the person who is questioned makes such replies as I should make and comes to grief, then I am refuted,
<milestone n="166b" unit="section"/>but if his replies are quite different, then the person questioned is refuted, not I.  Take this example.  Do you suppose you could get anybody to admit that the memory a man has of a past feeling he no longer feels is anything like the feeling at the time when he was feeling it?  Far from it.  Or that he would refuse to admit that it is possible for one and the same person to know and not to know one and the same thing?  Or if he were afraid to admit this, would he ever admit that a person who has become unlike is the same as before he became unlike?  In fact, if we are to be on our guard against such verbal entanglements, would he admit that a person is one at all, and not many, who become infinite in number,
<milestone n="166c" unit="section"/>if the process of becoming different continues?  But, my dear fellow,&rdquo; he will say, &ldquo;attack my real doctrines in a more generous manner, and prove, if you can, that perceptions, when they come, or become, to each of us, are not individual, or that, if they are individual, what appears to each one would not, for all that, become to that one alone&mdash;or, if you prefer to say 'be,' would not be&mdash;to whom it appears.  But when you talk of pigs and dog-faced baboons, you not only act like a pig yourself, but you persuade your hearers to act so toward my writings,
<milestone n="166d" unit="section"/>and that is not right.  For I maintain that the truth is as I have written;  each one of us is the measure of the things that are and those that are not;  but each person differs immeasurably from every other in just this, that to one person some things appear and are, and to another person other things.  And I do not by any means say that wisdom and the wise man do not exist;  on the contrary, I say that if bad things appear and are to any one of us, precisely that man is wise who causes a change and makes good things appear and be to him. 
<milestone n="166e" unit="section"/>And, moreover, do not lay too much stress upon the words of my argument, but get a clearer understanding of my meaning from what I am going to say.  Recall to your mind what was said before, that his food appears and is bitter to the sick man, but appears and is the opposite of bitter to the man in health.  Now neither of these two is to be made wiser than he is&mdash;that is not possible&mdash;
<milestone unit="page" n="167"/><milestone n="167a" unit="section"/>nor should the claim be made that the sick man is ignorant because his opinions are ignorant, or the healthy man wise because his are different;  but a change must be made from the one condition to the other, for the other is better.  So, too, in education a change has to be made from a worse to a better condition;  but the physician causes the change by means of drugs, and the teacher of wisdom by means of words.  And yet, in fact, no one ever made anyone think truly who previously thought falsely, since it is impossible to think that which is not or to think any other things than those which one feels;  and these are always true.  But I believe that a man who, on account of a bad condition of soul,
<milestone n="167b" unit="section"/>thinks thoughts akin to that condition, is made by a good condition of soul to think correspondingly good thoughts;  and some men, through inexperience, call these appearances true, whereas I call them better than the others, but in no wise truer.  And the wise, my dear Socrates, I do not by any means call tadpoles when they have to do with the human body, I call them physicians, and when they have to do with plants, husbandmen;  for I assert that these latter, when plants are sickly, instil into them good and healthy sensations,
<milestone n="167c" unit="section"/>and true ones instead of bad sensations, and that the wise and good orators make the good, instead of the evil, seem to be right to their states.  For I claim that whatever seems right and honorable to a state is really right and honorable to it, so long as it believes it to be so;  but the wise man causes the good, instead of that which is evil to them in each instance, to be and seem right and honorable.  And on the same principle the teacher who is able to train his pupils in this manner is not only wise but is also
<milestone n="167d" unit="section"/>entitled to receive high pay from them when their education is finished.  And in this sense it is true that some men are wiser than others, and that no one thinks falsely, and that you, whether you will or no, must endure to be a measure.  Upon these positions my doctrine stands firm;  and if you can dispute it in principle, dispute it by bringing an opposing doctrine against it;  or if you prefer the method of questions, ask questions;  for an intelligent person ought not to reject this method, on the contrary, he should choose it before all others.  However, let me make a suggestion:  do not be unfair in your questioning; 
<milestone n="167e" unit="section"/>it is very inconsistent for a man who asserts that he cares for virtue to be constantly unfair in discussion;  and it is unfair in discussion when a man makes no distinction between merely trying to make points and carrying on a real argument.  In the former he may jest and try to trip up his opponent as much as he can, but in real argument he must be in earnest and must set his interlocutor on his feet, pointing out to him those slips only which are due to himself and
<milestone unit="page" n="168"/><milestone n="168a" unit="section"/>his previous associations.  For if you act in this way, those who debate with you will cast the blame for their confusion and perplexity upon themselves, not upon you;  they will run after you and love you, and they will hate themselves and run away from themselves, taking refuge in philosophy, that they may escape from their former selves by becoming different.  But if you act in the opposite way, as most teachers do, you will produce the opposite result, and instead of making your young associates philosophers, you will make them hate philosophy
<milestone n="168b" unit="section"/>when they grow older.  If therefore, you will accept the suggestion which I made before, you will avoid a hostile and combative attitude and in a gracious spirit will enter the lists with me and inquire what we really mean when we declare that all things are in motion and that whatever seems is to each individual, whether man or state.  And on the basis of that you will consider the question whether knowledge and perception are the same or different, instead of doing as you did a while ago, using as your basis
<milestone n="168c" unit="section"/>the ordinary meaning of names and words, which most people pervert in haphazard ways and thereby cause all sorts of perplexity in one another.&rdquo;  Such, Theodorus, is the help I have furnished your friend to the best of my ability&mdash;not much, for my resources are small;  but if he were living himself he would have helped his offspring in a fashion more magnificent.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theodorus</speaker><p>You are joking, Socrates, for you have come to the man's assistance with all the valor of youth.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Thank you, my friend.  Tell me, did you observe just now that Protagoras reproached us
<milestone n="168d" unit="section"/>for addressing our words to a boy, and said that we made the boy's timidity aid us in our argument against his doctrine, and that he called our procedure a mere display of wit, solemnly insisting upon the importance of &ldquo;the measure of all things,&rdquo; and urging us to treat his doctrine seriously?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theodorus</speaker><p>Of course I observed it, Socrates.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Well then, shall we do as he says?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theodorus</speaker><p>By all means.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Now you see that all those present, except you and myself are boys.  So if we are to do as the man asks, you and I must
<milestone n="168e" unit="section"/>question each other and make reply in order to show our serious attitude towards his doctrine;  then he cannot, at any rate, find fault with us on the ground that we examined his doctrine in a spirit of levity with mere boys.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theodorus</speaker><p>Why is this?  Would not Theaetetus follow an investigation better than many a man with a long beard?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Yes, but not better than you, Theodorus.  So you must not imagine that I have to defend your deceased friend
<milestone unit="page" n="169"/><milestone n="169a" unit="section"/>by any and every means, while you do nothing at all;  but come, my good man, follow the discussion a little way, just until we can see whether, after all, you must be a measure in respect to diagrams, or whether all men are as sufficient unto themselves as you are in astronomy and the other sciences in which you are alleged to be superior.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theodorus</speaker><p>It is not easy, Socrates, for anyone to sit beside you and not be forced to give an account of himself and it was foolish of me just now to say you would excuse me and would not oblige me, as the Lacedaemonians do, to strip;  you seem to me to take rather after Sciron.<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">Sciron was a mighty man who attacked all who came near him and threw them from a cliff.  He was overcome by Theseus.  Antaeus, a terrible giant, forced all passersby to wrestle with him.  He was invincible until Heracles crushed him in his arms.</note> For the Lacedaemonians
<milestone n="169b" unit="section"/>tell people to go away or else strip, but you seem to me to play rather the role of Antaeus;  for you do not let anyone go who approaches you until you have forced him to strip and wrestle with you in argument.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Your comparison with Sciron and Antaeus pictures my complaint admirably;  only I am a more stubborn combatant than they;  for many a Heracles and many a Theseus, strong men of words, have fallen in with me and belabored me mightily, but still I do not desist, such a terrible love
<milestone n="169c" unit="section"/>of this kind of exercise has taken hold on me.  So, now that it is your turn, do not refuse to try a bout with me;  it will be good for both of us.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theodorus</speaker><p>I say no more.  Lead on as you like.  Most assuredly I must endure whatsoever fate you spin for me, and submit to interrogation.  However, I shall not be able to leave myself in your hands beyond the point you propose.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Even that is enough.  And please be especially careful that we do not inadvertently give a playful turn
<milestone n="169d" unit="section"/>to our argument and somebody reproach us again for it.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theodorus</speaker><p>Rest assured that I will try so far as in me lies.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Let us, therefore, first take up the same question as before, and let us see whether we were right or wrong in being displeased and finding fault with the doctrine because it made each individual self-sufficient in wisdom.  Protagoras granted that some persons excelled others in respect to the better and the worse, and these he said were wise, did he not?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theodorus</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Now if he himself were present and could agree to this, instead of
<milestone n="169e" unit="section"/>our making the concession for him in our effort to help him, there would be no need of taking up the question again or of reinforcing his argument.  But, as it is, perhaps it might be said that we have no authority to make the agreement for him;  therefore it is better to make the agreement still clearer on this particular point;  for it makes a good deal of difference whether it is so or not.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theodorus</speaker><p>That is true.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Let us then get the agreement in as concise a form as possible, not through others,
<milestone unit="page" n="170"/><milestone n="170a" unit="section"/>but from his own statement.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theodorus</speaker><p>How?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>In this way:  He says, does he not?  &ldquo;that which appears to each person really is to him to whom it appears.&rdquo;</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theodorus</speaker><p>Yes, that is what he says.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Well then, Protagoras, we also utter the opinions of a man, or rather, of all men, and we say that there is no one who does not think himself wiser than others in some respects and others wiser than himself in other respects;  for instance, in times of greatest danger, when people are distressed in war or by diseases or at sea, they regard their commanders as gods and expect them to be their saviors,
<milestone n="170b" unit="section"/>though they excel them in nothing except knowledge.  And all the world of men is, I dare say, full of people seeking teachers and rulers for themselves and the animals and for human activities, and, on the other hand, of people who consider themselves qualified to teach and qualified to rule.  And in all these instances we must say that men themselves believe that wisdom and ignorance exist in the world of men, must we not?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theodorus</speaker><p>Yes, we must.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And therefore they think that wisdom is true thinking and ignorance false opinion, do they not?
<milestone n="170c" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Theodorus</speaker><p>Of course.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Well then, Protagoras, what shall we do about the doctrine?  Shall we say that the opinions which men have are always true, or sometimes true and sometimes false?  For the result of either statement is that their opinions are not always true, but may be either true or false.  Just think, Theodorus, would any follower of Protagoras, or you yourself care to contend that no person thinks that another is ignorant and has false opinions?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theodorus</speaker><p>No, that is incredible, Socrates.
<milestone n="170d" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And yet this is the predicament to which the doctrine that man is the measure of all things inevitably leads.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theodorus</speaker><p>How so?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>When you have come to a decision in your own mind about something, and declare your opinion to me, this opinion is, according to his doctrine, true to you;  let us grant that;  but may not the rest of us sit in judgement on your decision, or do we always judge that your opinion is true?  Do not myriads of men on each occasion oppose their opinions to yours, believing that your judgement and belief are false?
<milestone n="170e" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Theodorus</speaker><p>Yes, by Zeus, Socrates, countless myriads in truth, as Homer<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb"><bibl n="Hom. Od. 16.121">Hom.  Od. 16.121</bibl> <bibl n="Hom. Od. 17.432">Hom.  Od.17.432</bibl> <bibl n="Hom. Od. 19.78">Hom.  Od. 19.78</bibl></note> says, and they give me all the trouble in the world.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Well then, shall we say that in such a case your opinion is true to you but false to the myriads?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theodorus</speaker><p>That seems to be the inevitable deduction.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And what of Protagoras himself?  If neither he himself thought, nor people in general think, as indeed they do not, that man is the measure of all things, is it not inevitable that the &ldquo;truth&rdquo; which he wrote is true to no one?  But if he himself thought it was true,
<milestone unit="page" n="171"/><milestone n="171a" unit="section"/>and people in general do not agree with him, in the first place you know that it is just so much more false than true as the number of those who do not believe it is greater than the number of those who do.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theodorus</speaker><p>Necessarily, if it is to be true or false according to each individual opinion.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Secondly, it involves this, which is a very pretty result;  he concedes about his own opinion the truth of the opinion of those who disagree with him and think that his opinion is false, since he grants that the opinions of all men are true.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theodorus</speaker><p>Certainly.
<milestone n="171b" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then would he not be conceding that his own opinion is false, if he grants that the opinion of those who think he is in error is true?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theodorus</speaker><p>Necessarily.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>But the others do not concede that they are in error, do they?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theodorus</speaker><p>No, they do not.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And he, in turn, according to his writings, grants that this opinion also is true.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theodorus</speaker><p>Evidently.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then all men, beginning with Protagoras, will dispute&mdash;or rather, he will grant, after he once concedes that the opinion of the man who holds the opposite view is true&mdash;even Protagoras himself, I say,
<milestone n="171c" unit="section"/>will concede that neither a dog nor any casual man is a measure of anything whatsoever that he has not learned.  Is not that the case?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theodorus</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then since the &ldquo;truth&rdquo; of Protagoras is disputed by all, it would be true to nobody, neither to anyone else nor to him.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theodorus</speaker><p>I think, Socrates, we are running my friend too hard.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>But, my dear man, I do not see that we are running beyond what is right.  Most likely, though, he, being older,
<milestone n="171d" unit="section"/>is wiser than we, and if, for example, he should emerge from the ground, here at our feet, if only as far as the neck, he would prove abundantly that I was making a fool of myself by my talk, in all probability, and you by agreeing with me;  then he would sink down and be off at a run.  But we, I suppose, must depend on ourselves, such as we are, and must say just what we think.  And so now must we not say that everybody would agree that some men are wiser and some more ignorant than others?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theodorus</speaker><p>Yes, I think at least we must.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And do you think his doctrine might stand most firmly in the form in which we sketched it when defending Protagoras,
<milestone n="171e" unit="section"/>that most things&mdash;hot, dry, sweet, and everything of that sort&mdash;are to each person as they appear to him, and if Protagoras is to concede that there are cases in which one person excels another, he might be willing to say that in matters of health and disease not every woman or child&mdash;or beast, for that matter&mdash;knows what is wholesome for it and is able to cure itself, but in this point, if in any, one person excels another?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theodorus</speaker><p>Yes, I think that is correct.
<milestone unit="page" n="172"/><milestone n="172a" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And likewise in affairs of state, the honorable and disgraceful, the just and unjust, the pious and its opposite, are in truth to each state such as it thinks they are and as it enacts into law for itself, and in these matters no citizen and no state is wiser than another;  but in making laws that are advantageous to the state, or the reverse, Protagoras again will agree that one counsellor is better than another, and the opinion of one state better than that of another as regards the truth,
<milestone n="172b" unit="section"/>and he would by no means dare to affirm that whatsoever laws a state makes in the belief that they will be advantageous to itself are perfectly sure to prove advantageous.  But in the other class of things&mdash;I mean just and unjust, pious and impious&mdash;they are willing to say with confidence that no one of them possesses by nature an existence of its own;  on the contrary, that the common opinion becomes true at the time when it is adopted and remains true as long as it is held;  this is substantially the theory of those who do not altogether affirm the doctrine of Protagoras.  But, Theodorus, argument after argument,
<milestone n="172c" unit="section"/>a greater one after a lesser, is overtaking us.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theodorus</speaker><p>Well, Socrates, we have plenty of leisure, have we not?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Apparently we have.  And that makes me think, my friend, as I have often done before, how natural it is that those who have spent a long time in the study of philosophy appear ridiculous when they enter the courts of law as speakers.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theodorus</speaker><p>What do you mean?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Those who have knocked about in courts and the like from their youth up seem to me, when compared with those who have been brought up in philosophy
<milestone n="172d" unit="section"/>and similar pursuits, to be as slaves in breeding compared with freemen.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theodorus</speaker><p>In what way is this the case?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>In this way:  the latter always have that which you just spoke of, leisure, and they talk at their leisure in peace;  just as we are now taking up argument after argument, already beginning a third, so can they, if as in our case, the new one pleases them better than that in which they are engaged;  and they do not care at all whether their talk is long or short, if only they attain the truth.  But the men of the other sort are always in a hurry&mdash;for the water flowing through the water-clock urges them on&mdash;
<milestone n="172e" unit="section"/>and the other party in the suit does not permit them to talk about anything they please, but stands over them exercising the law's compulsion by reading the brief, from which no deviation is allowed (this is called the affidavit);<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">In Athenian legal procedure each party to a suit presented a written statement&mdash;the charge and the reply&mdash;at a preliminary hearing.  These statements were subsequently confirmed by oath, and the sworn statement was called <foreign lang="greek">DIWMOSI/A</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">A)NTWMOSI/A</foreign>, which is rendered above by &ldquo;affidavit&rdquo; as the nearest English equivalent.</note> and their discourse is always about a fellow slave and is addressed to a master who sits there holding some case or other in his hands;  and the contests never run an indefinite course, but are always directed to the point at issue, and often the race is for the defendant's life. 
<milestone unit="page" n="173"/><milestone n="173a" unit="section"/>As a result of all this, the speakers become tense and shrewd;  they know how to wheedle their master with words and gain his favor by acts;  but in their souls they become small and warped.  For they have been deprived of growth and straightforwardness and independence by the slavery they have endured from their youth up, for this forces them to do crooked acts by putting a great burden of fears and dangers upon their souls while these are still tender;  and since they cannot bear this burden with uprightness and truth, they turn forthwith to deceit and to requiting wrong with wrong, so that they become greatly bent and stunted. 
<milestone n="173b" unit="section"/>Consequently they pass from youth to manhood with no soundness of mind in them, but they think they have become clever and wise.  So much for them, Theodorus.  Shall we describe those who belong to our band, or shall we let that go and return to the argument, in order to avoid abuse of that freedom and variety of discourse, of which we were speaking just now?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theodorus</speaker><p>By all means, Socrates, describe them; 
<milestone n="173c" unit="section"/>for I like your saying that we who belong to this band are not the servants of our arguments, but the arguments are, as it were, our servants, and each of them must await our pleasure to be finished;  for we have neither judge, nor, as the poets have, any spectator set over us to censure and rule us.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Very well, that is quite appropriate, since it is your wish;  and let us speak of the leaders;  for why should anyone talk about the inferior philosophers?  The leaders, in the first place, from their youth up, remain ignorant of the way to the agora,
<milestone n="173d" unit="section"/>do not even know where the court-room is, or the senate-house, or any other public place of assembly;  as for laws and decrees, they neither hear the debates upon them nor see them when they are published;  and the strivings of political clubs after public offices, and meetings, and banquets, and revellings with chorus girls&mdash;it never occurs to them even in their dreams to indulge in such things.  And whether anyone in the city is of high or low birth, or what evil has been inherited by anyone from his ancestors, male or female, are matters to which they pay no more attention than to the number of pints in the sea, as the saying is. 
<milestone n="173e" unit="section"/>And all these things the philosopher does not even know that he does not know;  for he does not keep aloof from them for the sake of gaining reputation, but really it is only his body that has its place and home in the city;  his mind, considering all these things petty and of no account, disdains them and is borne in all directions, as Pindar<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">This may refer to <bibl n="Pind. N. 10">Pind. Nem. 10.87 f.:</bibl><foreign lang="greek">H(/MISU ME/N KE PNE/OIS GAI/AS U(PE/NERQEN E)W/N, H(/MISU D' OU)RANOU= E)N XRUSE/OIS DO/MOSIN</foreign>&ldquo;Thou (Polydeuces) shalt live being half the time under the earth and half the time in the golden dwellings of heaven,&rdquo; but it may be a quotation from one of the lost poems of Pindar.</note> says, &ldquo;both below the earth,&rdquo; and measuring the surface of the earth, and &ldquo;above the sky,&rdquo; studying the stars, and investigating the universal nature
<milestone unit="page" n="174"/><milestone n="174a" unit="section"/>of every thing that is, each in its entirety, never lowering itself to anything close at hand.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theodorus</speaker><p>What do you mean by this, Socrates?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Why, take the case of Thales, Theodorus.  While he was studying the stars and looking upwards, he fell into a pit, and a neat, witty Thracian servant girl jeered at him, they say, because he was so eager to know the things in the sky that he could not see what was there before him at his very feet.  The same jest applies to all who pass their lives in philosophy. 
<milestone n="174b" unit="section"/>For really such a man pays no attention to his next door neighbor;  he is not only ignorant of what he is doing, but he hardly knows whether he is a human being or some other kind of a creature;  but what a human being is and what is proper for such a nature to do or bear different from any other, this he inquires and exerts himself to find out.  Do you understand, Theodorus, or not?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theodorus</speaker><p>Yes, I do;  you are right.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Hence it is, my friend, such a man, both in private, when he meets with individuals, and in public, as I said in the beginning,
<milestone n="174c" unit="section"/>when he is obliged to speak in court or elsewhere about the things at his feet and before his eyes, is a laughing-stock not only to Thracian girls but to the multitude in general, for he falls into pits and all sorts of perplexities through inexperience, and his awkwardness is terrible, making him seem a fool;  for when it comes to abusing people he has no personal abuse to offer against anyone, because he knows no evil of any man, never having cared for such things;  so his perplexity makes him appear ridiculous;  and as to laudatory speeches
<milestone n="174d" unit="section"/>and the boastings of others, it becomes manifest that he is laughing at them&mdash;not pretending to laugh, but really laughing&mdash;and so he is thought to be a fool.  When he hears a panegyric of a despot or a king he fancies he is listening to the praises of some herdsman&mdash;a swineherd, a shepherd, or a neatherd, for instance&mdash;who gets much milk from his beasts;  but he thinks that the ruler tends and milks a more perverse and treacherous creature than the herdsmen, and that he must grow coarse and uncivilized,
<milestone n="174e" unit="section"/>no less than they, for he has no leisure and lives surrounded by a wall, as the herdsmen live in their mountain pens.  And when he hears that someone is amazingly rich, because he owns ten thousand acres of land or more, to him, accustomed as he is to think of the whole earth, this seems very little.  And when people sing the praises of lineage and say someone is of noble birth, because he can show seven wealthy ancestors, he thinks that such praises betray an altogether dull and narrow vision on the part of those who utter them; 
<milestone unit="page" n="175"/><milestone n="175a" unit="section"/>because of lack of education they cannot keep their eyes fixed upon the whole and are unable to calculate that every man has had countless thousands of ancestors and progenitors, among whom have been in any instance rich and poor, kings and slaves, barbarians and Greeks.  And when people pride themselves on a list of twenty-five ancestors and trace their pedigree back to Heracles, the son of Amphitryon, the pettiness of their ideas seems absurd to him;  he laughs at them because they cannot free their silly minds of vanity by calculating that
<milestone n="175b" unit="section"/>Amphitryon's twenty-fifth ancestor was such as fortune happened to make him, and the fiftieth for that matter.  In all these cases the philosopher is derided by the common herd, partly because he seems to be contemptuous, partly because he is ignorant of common things and is always in perplexity.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theodorus</speaker><p>That all happens just as you say, Socrates.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>But when, my friend,
<milestone n="175c" unit="section"/>he draws a man upwards and the other is willing to rise with him above the level of &ldquo;What wrong have I done you or you me?&rdquo; to the investigation of abstract right and wrong, to inquire what each of them is and wherein they differ from each other and from all other things, or above the level of &ldquo;Is a king happy?&rdquo; or, on the other hand, &ldquo;Has he great wealth?&rdquo; to the investigation of royalty and of human happiness and wretchedness in general, to see what the nature of each is and in what way man is naturally fitted to gain the one and escape the other&mdash;
<milestone n="175d" unit="section"/>when that man of small and sharp and pettifogging mind is compelled in his turn to give an account of all these things, then the tables are turned;  dizzied by the new experience of hanging at such a height, he gazes downward from the air in dismay and perplexity;  he stammers and becomes ridiculous, not in the eyes of Thracian girls or other uneducated persons, for they have no perception of it, but in those of all men who have been brought up as free men, not as slaves.  Such is the character of each of the two classes, Theodorus, of the man who has truly been brought up in freedom
<milestone n="175e" unit="section"/>and leisure, whom you call a philosopher&mdash;who may without censure appear foolish and good for nothing when he is involved in menial services, if, for instance, he does not know how to pack up his bedding, much less to put the proper sweetening into a sauce or a fawning speech&mdash;and of the other, who can perform all such services smartly and quickly, but does not know how to wear his cloak as a freeman should, properly draped,<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">The Athenians regarded the proper draping of the cloak as a sign of good breeding.  The well-bred Athenian first threw his cloak over the left shoulder, then passed it round the back to the right side, then either above or below the right arm, and finally over the left arm or shoulder.  See Aristophanes, <title>Birds</title>, <date value="1567">1567</date> f., with Blaydes's notes.</note> still less to acquire the true harmony of speech
<milestone unit="page" n="176"/><milestone n="176a" unit="section"/>and hymn aright the praises of the true life of gods and blessed men.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theodorus</speaker><p>If, Socrates, you could persuade all men of the truth of what you say as you do me, there would be more peace and fewer evils among mankind.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>But it is impossible that evils should be done away with, Theodorus, for there must always be something opposed to the good;  and they cannot have their place among the gods, but must inevitably hover about mortal nature and this earth.  Therefore we ought to try to escape from earth to the dwelling of the gods as quickly as we can; 
<milestone n="176b" unit="section"/>and to escape is to become like God, so far as this is possible;  and to become like God is to become righteous and holy and wise.  But, indeed, my good friend, it is not at all easy to persuade people that the reason generally advanced for the pursuit of virtue and the avoidance of vice&mdash;namely, in order that a man may not seem bad and may seem good&mdash;is not the reason why the one should be practiced and the other not;  that, I think, is merely old wives' chatter, as the saying is. 
<milestone n="176c" unit="section"/>Let us give the true reason.  God is in no wise and in no manner unrighteous, but utterly and perfectly righteous, and there is nothing so like him as that one of us who in turn becomes most nearly perfect in righteousness.  It is herein that the true cleverness of a man is found and also his worthlessness and cowardice;  for the knowledge of this is wisdom or true virtue, and ignorance of it is folly or manifest wickedness;  and all the other kinds of seeming cleverness and wisdom are paltry when they appear in public affairs and vulgar in the arts.  Therefore by far the best thing for the unrighteous man
<milestone n="176d" unit="section"/>and the man whose words or deeds are impious is not to grant that he is clever through knavery;  for such men glory in that reproach, and think it means that they are not triflers, &ldquo;useless burdens upon the earth,&rdquo;<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb"><bibl n="Hom. Il. 18.104">Hom. Il. 18.104;</bibl><bibl n="Hom. Od. 20.379.">Hom. Od. 20. 379</bibl></note> but such as men should be who are to live safely in a state.  So we must tell them the truth&mdash;that just because they do not think they are such as they are, they are so all the more truly;  for they do not know the penalty of unrighteousness, which is the thing they most ought to know.  For it is not what they think it is&mdash;scourgings and death, which they sometimes escape entirely when they have done wrong&mdash;but a penalty which it is impossible
<milestone n="176e" unit="section"/>to escape.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theodorus</speaker><p>What penalty do you mean?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Two patterns, my friend, are set up in the world, the divine, which is most blessed, and the godless, which is most wretched.  But these men do not see that this is the case, and their silliness and extreme foolishness blind them to the fact that
<milestone unit="page" n="177"/><milestone n="177a" unit="section"/>through their unrighteous acts they are made like the one and unlike the other.  They therefore pay the penalty for this by living a life that conforms to the pattern they resemble;  and if we tell them that, unless they depart from their &ldquo;cleverness,&rdquo; the blessed place that is pure of all things evil will not receive them after death, and here on earth they will always live the life like themselves&mdash;evil men associating with evil&mdash;when they hear this, they will be so confident in their unscrupulous cleverness that they will think our words the talk of fools.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theodorus</speaker><p>Very true, Socrates.
<milestone n="177b" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Yes, my friend, I know.  However, there is one thing that has happened to them:  whenever they have to carry on a personal argument about the doctrines to which they object, if they are willing to stand their ground for a while like men and do not run away like cowards, then, my friend, they at last become strangely dissatisfied with themselves and their arguments;  their brilliant rhetoric withers away, so that they seem no better than children.  But this is a digression.  Let us turn away from these matters&mdash;if we do not,
<milestone n="177c" unit="section"/>they will come on like an ever-rising flood and bury in silt our original argument&mdash;and let us, if you please, proceed.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theodorus</speaker><p>To me, Socrates, such digressions are quite as agreeable as the argument;  for they are easier for a man of my age to follow.  However, if you prefer, let us return to our argument.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Very well.  We were at about the point in our argument where we said that those who declare that only motion is reality, and that whatever seems to each man really is to him to whom it seems, are willing to maintain their position in regard to other matters
<milestone n="177d" unit="section"/>and to maintain especially in regard to justice that whatever laws a state makes, because they seem to it just, are just to the state that made them, as long as they remain in force;  but as regards the good, that nobody has the courage to go on and contend that whatever laws a state passes thinking them advantageous to it are really advantageous as long as they remain in force, unless what he means is merely the name &ldquo;advantageous&rdquo;<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">The legislator may call his laws advantageous, and that name, if it is given them when they are enacted, will belong to them, whatever their character may be.</note>;  and that would be making a joke of our argument.  Am I right?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theodorus</speaker><p>Certainly.
<milestone n="177e" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Yes;  for he must not mean merely the name, but the thing named must be the object of his attention.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theodorus</speaker><p>True.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>But the state, in making laws, aims, of course, at advantage, whatever the name it gives it, and makes all its laws as advantageous as possible to itself, to the extent of its belief and ability;  or has it in making laws anything else in view?
<milestone unit="page" n="178"/><milestone n="178a" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Theodorus</speaker><p>Certainly not.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And does it always hit the mark, or does every state often miss it?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theodorus</speaker><p>I should say they do often miss it!</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Continuing, then, and proceeding from this point, every one would more readily agree to this assertion, if the question were asked concerning the whole class to which the advantageous belongs;  and that whole class, it would seem, pertains to the future.  For when we make laws, we make them with the idea that they will be advantageous in after time;  and this is rightly called the future.
<milestone n="178b" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Theodorus</speaker><p>Certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Come then, on this assumption, let us question Protagoras or someone of those who agree with him.  Man is the measure of all things, as your school says, Protagoras, of the white, the heavy, the light, everything of that sort without exception;  for he possesses within himself the standard by which to judge them, and when his thoughts about them coincide with his sensations, he thinks what to him is true and really is.  Is not that what they say?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theodorus</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Does he, then, also, Protagoras, we shall say, possess within himself the standard by which to judge of the things which are yet to be, and do those things
<milestone n="178c" unit="section"/>which he thinks will be actually come to pass for him who thought them?  Take, for instance, heat;  if some ordinary man thinks he is going to take a fever, that is to say, that this particular heat will be, and some other man, who is a physician, thinks the contrary, whose opinion shall we expect the future to prove right?  Or perhaps the opinion of both, and the man will become, not hot or feverish to the physician, but to himself both?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theodorus</speaker><p>No, that would be ridiculous.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>But, I imagine, in regard to the sweetness or dryness
<milestone n="178d" unit="section"/>which will be in a wine, the opinion of the husbandman, not that of the lyre-player, will be valid.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theodorus</speaker><p>Of course.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And again, in a matter of discord or tunefulness in music that has never been played, a gymnastic teacher could not judge better than a musician what will, when performed, seem tuneful even to a gymnastic teacher himself.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theodorus</speaker><p>Certainly not.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then, too, when a banquet is in preparation the opinion of him who is to be a guest, unless he has training in cookery, is of less value concerning the pleasure that will be derived from the viands than that of the cook. 
<milestone n="178e" unit="section"/>For we need not yet argue about that which already is or has been pleasant to each one but concerning that which will in the future seem and be pleasant to each one, is he himself the best judge for himself, or would you, Protagoras&mdash;at least as regards the arguments which will be persuasive in court to each of us&mdash;be able to give an opinion beforehand better than anyone whatsoever who has no especial training?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theodorus</speaker><p>Certainly, Socrates, in this, at any rate, he used to declare emphatically that he himself excelled everyone.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Yes, my friend, he certainly did;  otherwise nobody would have paid him a high fee
<milestone unit="page" n="179"/><milestone n="179a" unit="section"/>for his conversations, if he had not made his pupils believe that neither a prophet nor anyone else could judge better than himself what was in the future to be and seem.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theodorus</speaker><p>Very true.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Both lawmaking, then, and the advantageous are concerned with the future, and everyone would agree that a state in making laws must often fail to attain the greatest advantage?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theodorus</speaker><p>Assuredly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then it will be a fair answer if we say to your master
<milestone n="179b" unit="section"/>that he is obliged to agree that one man is wiser than another, and that such a wise man is a measure, but that I, who am without knowledge, am not in the least obliged to become a measure, as the argument in his behalf just now tried to oblige me to be, whether I would or no.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theodorus</speaker><p>In that respect, Socrates, I think that the argument is most clearly proved to be wrong, and it is proved wrong in this also, in that it declares the opinions of others to be valid, whereas it was shown that they do not consider his arguments true at all.
<milestone n="179c" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>In many other respects, Theodorus, it could be proved that not every opinion of every person is true, at any rate in matters of that kind;  but it is more difficult to prove that opinions are not true in regard to the momentary states of feeling of each person, from which our perceptions and the opinions concerning them arise.  But perhaps I am quite wrong;  for it may be impossible to prove that they are not true, and those who say that they are manifest and are forms of knowledge may perhaps be right, and Theaetetus here was not far from the mark in saying that perception and knowledge are identical. 
<milestone n="179d" unit="section"/>So we must, as the argument in behalf of Protagoras<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">See 168 B.</note> enjoined upon us, come up closer and examine this doctrine of motion as the fundamental essence, rapping on it to see whether it rings sound or unsound.  As you know, a strife has arisen about it, no mean one, either, and waged by not a few combatants.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theodorus</speaker><p>Yes, far from mean, and it is spreading far and wide all over <placeName key="tgn,6002765">Ionia</placeName>;  for the disciples of Heracleitus are supporting this doctrine very vigorously.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Therefore, my dear Theodorus, we must all the more examine it
<milestone n="179e" unit="section"/>from the beginning as they themselves present it.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theodorus</speaker><p>Certainly we must.  For it is no more possible, Socrates, to discuss these doctrines of Heracleitus (or, as you say, of Homer or even earlier sages) with the Ephesians themselves&mdash;those, at least, who profess to be familiar with them&mdash;than with madmen.  For they are, quite in accordance with their text-books, in perpetual motion;  but as for keeping to an argument or a question and quietly answering and asking in turn,
<milestone unit="page" n="180"/><milestone n="180a" unit="section"/>their power of doing that is less than nothing;  or rather the words &ldquo;nothing at all&rdquo; fail to express the absence from these fellows of even the slightest particle of rest.  But if you ask one of them a question, he pulls out puzzling little phrases, like arrows from a quiver, and shoots them off;  and if you try to get hold of an explanation of what he has said, you will be struck with another phrase of novel and distorted wording, and you never make any progress whatsoever with any of them, nor do they themselves with one another, for that matter,
<milestone n="180b" unit="section"/>but they take very good care to allow nothing to be settled either in an argument or in their own minds, thinking, I suppose, that this is being stationary;  but they wage bitter war against the stationary, and, so far as they can, they banish it altogether.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Perhaps, Theodorus, you have seen the men when they are fighting, but have not been with them when they are at peace;  for they are no friends of yours;  but I fancy they utter such peaceful doctrines at leisure to those pupils whom they wish to make like themselves.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theodorus</speaker><p>What pupils, my good man?  Such people do not become
<milestone n="180c" unit="section"/>pupils of one another, but they grow up of themselves, each one getting his inspiration from any chance source, and each thinks the other knows nothing.  From these people, then, as I was going to say, you would never get an argument either with their will or against it;  but we must ourselves take over the question and investigate it as if it were a problem of mathematics.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Yes, what you say is reasonable.  Now as for the problem, have we not heard from the ancients, who concealed their meaning from the multitude
<milestone n="180d" unit="section"/>by their poetry, that the origin of all things is Oceanus and Tethys, flowing streams, and that nothing is at rest and likewise from the modern, who, since they are wiser, declare their meaning openly, in order that even cobblers may hear and know their wisdom and may cease from the silly belief that some things are at rest and others in motion, and, after learning that everything is in motion, may honor their teachers?  But, Theodorus, I almost forgot that others teach the opposite of this,
<milestone n="180e" unit="section"/><quote type="verse"><l met="dactylic">So that it is motionless, the name of which is the All,</l></quote><bibl>Parmenides, line 98 (ed. Mullach)</bibl><note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">In its context the infinitive is necessary;  but Plato may have quoted carelessly and may have used the indicative.</note> and all the other doctrines maintained by Melissus and Parmenides and the rest, in opposition to all these they maintain that everything is one and is stationary within itself, having no place in which to move.  What shall we do with all these people, my friend?  For, advancing little by little, we have unwittingly fallen between the two parties, and,
<milestone unit="page" n="181"/><milestone n="181a" unit="section"/>unless we protect ourselves and escape somehow, we shall pay the penalty, like those in the palaestra, who in playing on the line are caught by both sides and dragged in opposite directions.<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">In the game referred to (called <foreign lang="greek">DIELKUSTI/NDA</foreign> by Pollux, ix. 112) the players were divided into two parties, each of which tried to drag its opponents over a line drawn across the palaestra.</note> I think, then, we had better examine first the one party, those whom we originally set out to join, the flowing ones, and if we find their arguments sound, we will help them to pull us over, trying thus to escape the others;  but if we find that the partisans of &ldquo;the whole&rdquo; seem to have truer doctrines, we will take refuge with them from those who would move what is motionless. 
<milestone n="181b" unit="section"/>But if we find that neither party has anything reasonable to say, we shall be ridiculous if we think that we, who are of no account, can say anything worth while after having rejected the doctrines of very ancient and very wise men.  Therefore, Theodorus, see whether it is desirable to go forward into so great a danger.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theodorus</speaker><p>Oh, it would be unendurable, Socrates, not to examine thoroughly the doctrines of both parties.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then they must be examined, since you are so urgent.  Now I think the starting-point of our examination of the doctrine of motion is this: 
<milestone n="181c" unit="section"/>Exactly what do they mean, after all, when they say that all things are in motion?  What I wish to ask is this:  Do they mean to say that there is only one kind of motion or, as I believe, two?  But it must not be my belief alone;  you must share it also, that if anything happens to us we may suffer it in common.  Tell me, do you call it motion when a thing changes its place or turns round in the same place?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theodorus</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Let this, then, be one kind of motion.  Now when a thing
<milestone n="181d" unit="section"/>remains in the same place, but grows old, or becomes black instead of white, or hard instead of soft, or undergoes any other kind of alteration, is it not proper to say that this is another kind of motion?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theodorus</speaker><p>I think so.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Nay, it must be true.  So I say that there are these two kinds of motion:  &ldquo;alteration,&rdquo; and &ldquo;motion in space.&rdquo;</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theodorus</speaker><p>And you are right.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Now that we have made this distinction, let us at once converse with those who say that all things are in motion, and let us ask them, &ldquo;Do you mean that everything moves in both ways,
<milestone n="181e" unit="section"/>moving in space and undergoing alteration, or one thing in both ways and another in one of the two ways only?&rdquo;</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theodorus</speaker><p>By Zeus, I cannot tell!  But I think they would say that everything moves in both ways.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Yes;  otherwise, my friend, they will find that things in motion are also things at rest, and it will be no more correct to say that all things are in motion than that all things are at rest.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theodorus</speaker><p>What you say is very true.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then since they must be in motion, and since absence of motion must be impossible for anything, all things are
<milestone unit="page" n="182"/><milestone n="182a" unit="section"/>always in all kinds of motion.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theodorus</speaker><p>Necessarily.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then just examine this point of their doctrine.  Did we not find that they say that heat or whiteness or anything you please arises in some such way as this, namely that each of these moves simultaneously with perception between the active and the passive element, and the passive becomes percipient, but not perception, and the active becomes, not a quality, but endowed with a quality?  Now perhaps quality seems an extraordinary word, and you do not understand it when used with general application, so let me give particular examples. 
<milestone n="182b" unit="section"/>For the active element becomes neither heat nor whiteness, but hot or white, and other things in the same way;  you probably remember that this was what we said earlier in our discourse, that nothing is in itself unvaryingly one, neither the active nor the passive, but from the union of the two with one another the perceptions and the perceived give birth and the latter become things endowed with some quality while the former become percipient.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theodorus</speaker><p>I remember, of course.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Let us then pay no attention to other matters, whether they teach
<milestone n="182c" unit="section"/>one thing or another;  but let us attend strictly to this only, which is the object of our discussion.  Let us ask them, &ldquo;Are all things, according to your doctrine, in motion and flux?&rdquo;  Is that so?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theodorus</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Have they then both kinds of motion which we distinguished?  Are they moving in space and also undergoing alteration?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theodorus</speaker><p>Of course;  that is, if they are to be in perfect motion.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then if they moved only in space, but did not undergo alteration, we could perhaps say what qualities belong to those moving things which are in flux, could we not?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theodorus</speaker><p>That is right.
<milestone n="182d" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>But since not even this remains fixed&mdash;that the thing in flux flows white, but changes, so that there is a flux of the very whiteness, and a change of color, that it may not in that way be convicted of remaining fixed, is it possible to give any name to a color, and yet to speak accurately?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theodorus</speaker><p>How can it be possible, Socrates, or to give a name to anything else of this sort, if while we are speaking it always evades us, being, as it is, in flux?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>But what shall we say of any of the perceptions, such as seeing or hearing?  Does it perhaps remain fixed in the condition of
<milestone n="182e" unit="section"/>seeing or hearing?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theodorus</speaker><p>It must be impossible, if all things are in motion.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then we must not speak of seeing more than not seeing, or of any other perception more than of non-perception, if all things are in all kinds of motion.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theodorus</speaker><p>No, we must not.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And yet perception is knowledge, as Theaetetus and I said.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theodorus</speaker><p>Yes, you did say that.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then when we were asked &ldquo;what is knowledge?&rdquo; we answered no more what knowledge is than what not-knowledge is.
<milestone unit="page" n="183"/><milestone n="183a" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Theodorus</speaker><p>So it seems.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>This would be a fine result of the correction of our answer, when we were so eager to show that all things are in motion, just for the purpose of making that answer prove to be correct.  But this, I think, did prove to be true, that if all things are in motion, every answer to any question whatsoever is equally correct, and we may say it is thus or not thus&mdash;or, if you prefer, &ldquo;becomes thus,&rdquo; to avoid giving them fixity by using the word &ldquo;is.&rdquo;</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theodorus</speaker><p>You are right.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Except, Theodorus, that I said &ldquo;thus,&rdquo; and &ldquo;not thus&rdquo;;  but we ought not even to say &ldquo;thus&rdquo;; 
<milestone n="183b" unit="section"/>for &ldquo;thus&rdquo; would no longer be in motion;  nor, again, &ldquo;not thus.&rdquo;  For there is no motion in &ldquo;this&rdquo; either;  but some other expression must be supplied for those who maintain this doctrine, since now they have, according to their own hypothesis, no words, unless it be perhaps the word &ldquo;nohow.&rdquo;  That might be most fitting for them, since it is indefinite.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theodorus</speaker><p>At any rate that is the most appropriate form of speech for them.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>So, Theodorus, we have got rid of your friend, and we do not yet concede to him that every man is a measure of all things, unless he be a sensible man; 
<milestone n="183c" unit="section"/>and we are not going to concede that knowledge is perception, at least not by the theory of universal motion, unless Theaetetus here has something different to say.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theodorus</speaker><p>An excellent idea, Socrates;  for now that this matter is settled, I too should be rid of the duty of answering your questions according to our agreement, since the argument about Protagoras is ended.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>No, Theodorus, not until you and Socrates
<milestone n="183d" unit="section"/>have discussed those who say all things are at rest, as you proposed just now.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theodorus</speaker><p>A young man like you, Theaetetus, teaching your elders to do wrong by breaking their agreements!  No;  prepare to answer Socrates yourself for the rest of the argument.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>I will if he wishes it.  But I should have liked best to hear about the doctrine I mentioned.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theodorus</speaker><p>Calling Socrates to an argument is calling cavalry into an open plain.<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">A proverbial expression.  An open plain is just what cavalry desires.</note> Just ask him a question and you shall hear.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Still I think, Theodorus,
<milestone n="183e" unit="section"/>I shall not comply with the request of Theaetetus.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theodorus</speaker><p>Why will you not comply with it?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Because I have a reverential fear of examining in a flippant manner Melissus and the others who teach that the universe is one and motionless, and because I reverence still more one man, Parmenides.  Parmenides seems to me to be, in Homer's words, &ldquo;one to be venerated&rdquo; and also &ldquo;awful.&rdquo;<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb"><bibl n="Hom. Il. 3.172">Il. 3.172;</bibl><bibl n="Hom. Od. 8.22">Od. 8.22;  xiv. 234</bibl></note> For I met him when I was very young and he was very old, and he appeared to me to possess an absolutely noble depth of mind. 
<milestone unit="page" n="184"/><milestone n="184a" unit="section"/>So I am afraid we may not understand his words and may be still farther from understanding what he meant by them;  but my chief fear is that the question with which we started, about the nature of knowledge, may fail to be investigated, because of the disorderly crowd of arguments which will burst in upon us if we let them in;  especially as the argument we are now proposing is of vast extent, and would not receive its deserts if we treated it as a side issue, and if we treat it as it deserves, it will take so long as to do away with the discussion about knowledge.  Neither of these things ought to happen, but we ought to try by the science of midwifery to deliver Theaetetus of the thoughts
<milestone n="184b" unit="section"/>about knowledge with which he is pregnant.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theodorus</speaker><p>Yes, if that is your opinion, we ought to do so.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Consider, then, Theaetetus, this further point about what has been said.  Now you answered that perception is knowledge, did you not?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>If, then, anyone should ask you, &ldquo;By what does a man see white and black colors and by what does he hear high and low tones?&rdquo; you would, I fancy, say, &ldquo;By his eyes and ears.&rdquo;</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes, I should.
<milestone n="184c" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>The easy use of words and phrases and the avoidance of strict precision is in general a sign of good breeding;  indeed, the opposite is hardly worthy of a gentleman, but sometimes it is necessary, as now it is necessary to object to your answer, in so far as it is incorrect.  Just consider;  which answer is more correct, that our eyes are that by which we see or that through which we see, and our ears that by which or that through which we hear?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>I think, Socrates, we perceive through, rather than by them, in each case.
<milestone n="184d" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Yes, for it would be strange indeed, my boy, if there are many senses ensconced within us, as if we were so many wooden horses of <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>, and they do not all unite in one power, whether we should call it soul or something else, by which we perceive through these as instruments the objects of perception.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>I think what you suggest is more likely than the other way.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Now the reason why I am so precise about the matter is this:  I want to know whether there is some one and the same power within ourselves by which we perceive black and white through the eyes, and again other qualities
<milestone n="184e" unit="section"/>through the other organs, and whether you will be able, if asked, to refer all such activities to the body.  But perhaps it is better that you make the statement in answer to a question than that I should take all the trouble for you.  So tell me:  do you not think that all the organs through which you perceive hot and hard and light and sweet are parts of the body?  Or are they parts of something else?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Of nothing else.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And will you also be ready to agree that it is impossible to perceive through one sense
<milestone unit="page" n="185"/><milestone n="185a" unit="section"/>what you perceive through another;  for instance, to perceive through sight what you perceive through hearing, or through hearing what you perceive through sight?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Of course I shall.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then if you have any thought about both of these together, you would not have perception about both together either through one organ or through the other.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>No.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Now in regard to sound and color, you have, in the first place, this thought about both of them, that they both exist?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And that each is different from the other and the same as itself?
<milestone n="185b" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Of course.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And that both together are two and each separately is one?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes, that also.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And are you able also to observe whether they are like or unlike each other?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>May be.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Now through what organ do you think all this about them?  For it is impossible to grasp that which is common to them both either through hearing or through sight.  Here is further evidence for the point I am trying to make:  if it were possible to investigate the question whether the two, sound and color, are bitter or not, you know that you will be able to tell by what faculty you will investigate it, and that is clearly
<milestone n="185c" unit="section"/>neither hearing nor sight, but something else.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Of course it is,&mdash;the faculty exerted through the tongue.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Very good.  But through what organ is the faculty exerted which makes known to you that which is common to all things, as well as to these of which we are speaking&mdash;that which you call being and not-being, and the other attributes of things, about which we were asking just now?  What organs will you assign for all these, through which that part of us which perceives gains perception of each and all of them?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>You mean being and not-being, and likeness and unlikeness, and identity and difference,
<milestone n="185d" unit="section"/>and also unity and plurality as applied to them.  And you are evidently asking also through what bodily organs we perceive by our soul the odd and the even and everything else that is in the same category.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Bravo, Theaetetus!  you follow me exactly;  that is just what I mean by my question.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>By Zeus, Socrates, I cannot answer, except that I think there is no special organ at all for these notions, as there are for those others;  but it appears to me that the soul views by itself directly
<milestone n="185e" unit="section"/>what all things have in common.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Why, you are beautiful, Theaetetus, and not, as Theodorus said, ugly;  for he who speaks beautifully is beautiful and good.  But besides being beautiful, you have done me a favor by relieving me from a long discussion, if you think that the soul views some things by itself directly and others through the bodily faculties;  for that was my own opinion, and I wanted you to agree.
<milestone unit="page" n="186"/><milestone n="186a" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Well, I do think so.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>To which class, then, do you assign being;  for this, more than anything else, belongs to all things?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>I assign them to the class of notions which the soul grasps by itself directly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And also likeness and unlikeness and identity and difference?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And how about beautiful and ugly, and good and bad?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>I think that these also are among the things the essence of which the soul most certainly views in their relations to one another, reflecting within itself upon the past and present
<milestone n="186b" unit="section"/>in relation to the future.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Stop there.  Does it not perceive the hardness of the hard through touch, and likewise the softness of the soft?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>But their essential nature and the fact that they exist, and their opposition to one another, and, in turn, the essential nature of this opposition, the soul itself tries to determine for us by reverting to them and comparing them with one another.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Is it not true, then, that all sensations which reach the soul through the body,
<milestone n="186c" unit="section"/>can be perceived by human beings, and also by animals, from the moment of birth;  whereas reflections about these, with reference to their being and usefulness, are acquired, if at all, with difficulty and slowly, through many troubles, in other words, through education?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Assuredly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Is it, then, possible for one to attain &ldquo;truth&rdquo; who cannot even get as far as &ldquo;being&rdquo;?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>No.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And will a man ever have knowledge of anything the truth of which he fails to attain?
<milestone n="186d" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>How can he, Socrates?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then knowledge is not in the sensations, but in the process of reasoning about them;  for it is possible, apparently, to apprehend being and truth by reasoning, but not by sensation.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>So it seems.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then will you call the two by the same name, when there are so great differences between them?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>No, that would certainly not be right.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>What name will you give, then, to the one which includes seeing, hearing, smelling, being cold, and being hot?
<milestone n="186e" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Perceiving.  What other name can I give it?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Collectively you call it, then, perception?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Of course.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>By which, we say, we are quite unable to apprehend truth, since we cannot apprehend being, either.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>No;  certainly not.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Nor knowledge either, then.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>No.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then, Theaetetus, perception and knowledge could never be the same.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Evidently not, Socrates;  and indeed now at last it has been made perfectly clear that knowledge is something different from perception.
<milestone unit="page" n="187"/><milestone n="187a" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>But surely we did not begin our conversation in order to find out what knowledge is not, but what it is.  However, we have progressed so far, at least, as not to seek for knowledge in perception at all, but in some function of the soul, whatever name is given to it when it alone and by itself is engaged directly with realities.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>That, Socrates, is, I suppose, called having opinion.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>You suppose rightly, my friend.  Now begin again
<milestone n="187b" unit="section"/>at the beginning.  Wipe out all we said before, and see if you have any clearer vision, now that you have advanced to this point.  Say once more what knowledge is.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>To say that all opinion is knowledge is impossible, Socrates, for there is also false opinion;  but true opinion probably is knowledge.  Let that be my answer.  For if it is proved to be wrong as we proceed, I will try to give another, just as I have given this.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>That is the right way, Theaetetus.  It is better to speak up boldly than to hesitate about answering, as you did at first.  For if we act in this way, one of two things will happen:  either we shall find what we are after,
<milestone n="187c" unit="section"/>or we shall be less inclined to think we know what we do not know at all;  and surely even that would be a recompense not to be despised.  Well, then, what do you say now?  Assuming that there are two kinds of opinion, one true and the other false, do you define knowledge as the true opinion?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes.  That now seems to me to be correct.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Is it, then, still worth while, in regard to opinion, to take up again&mdash;?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>What point do you refer to?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Somehow I am troubled now and have often been troubled before,
<milestone n="187d" unit="section"/>so that I have been much perplexed in my own reflections and in talking with others, because I cannot tell what this experience is which we human beings have, and how it comes about.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>What experience?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>That anyone has false opinions.  And so I am considering and am still in doubt whether we had better let it go or examine it by another method than the one we followed a while ago.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Why not, Socrates, if there seems to be the least need of it?  For just now, in talking about leisure, you and Theodorus said very truly that there is no hurry in discussions of this sort.
<milestone n="187e" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>You are right in reminding me.  For perhaps this is a good time to retrace our steps.  For it is better to finish a little task well than a great deal imperfectly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Of course.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>How, then, shall we set about it?  What is it that we do say?  Do we say that in every case of opinion there is a false opinion, and one of us has a false, and another a true opinion, because, as we believe, it is in the nature of things that this should be so?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes, we do.
<milestone unit="page" n="188"/><milestone n="188a" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then this, at any rate, is possible for us, is it not, regarding all things collectively and each thing separately, either to know or not to know them?  For learning and forgetting, as intermediate stages, I leave out of account for the present, for just now they have no bearing upon our argument.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Certainly, Socrates, nothing is left in any particular case except knowing or not knowing it.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then he who forms opinion must form opinion either about what he knows or about what he does not know?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Necessarily.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And it is surely impossible that one who knows a thing does not know it, or that one who does not know it
<milestone n="188b" unit="section"/>knows it.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then does he who forms false opinions think that the things which he knows are not these things, but some others of the things he knows, and so, knowing both, is he ignorant of both?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>That is impossible, Socrates.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Well then, does he think that the things he does not know are other things which he does not know&mdash;which is as if a man who knows neither Theaetetus nor Socrates should conceive the idea that Socrates is Theaetetus or Theaetetus Socrates?
<milestone n="188c" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>That is impossible.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>But surely a man does not think that the things he knows are the things he does not know, or again that the things he does not know are the things he knows.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>That would be a monstrous absurdity.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then how could he still form false opinions?  For inasmuch as all things are either known or unknown to us, it is impossible, I imagine, to form opinions outside of these alternatives, and within them it is clear that there is no place for fake opinion.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Very true.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Had we, then, better look for what we are seeking, not by this method of knowing and not knowing, but by that of being
<milestone n="188d" unit="section"/>and not being?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>What do you mean?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>We may simply assert that he who on any subject holds opinions which are not, will certainly think falsely, no matter what the condition of his mind may be in other respects.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>That, again, is likely, Socrates.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Well then, what shall we say, Theaetetus, if anyone asks us, &ldquo;Is that which is assumed in common speech possible at all, and can any human being hold an opinion which is not, whether it be concerned with any of the things which are, or be entirely independent of them?&rdquo;  We, I fancy,
<milestone n="188e" unit="section"/>shall reply, &ldquo;Yes, when, in thinking, he thinks what is not true,&rdquo; shall we not?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And is the same sort of thing possible in any other field?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>What sort of thing?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>For instance, that a man sees something, but sees nothing.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>How can he?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Yet surely if a man sees any one thing, he sees something that is.  Or do you, perhaps, think &ldquo;one&rdquo; is among the things that are not?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>No, I do not.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then he who sees any one thing, sees something that is.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>That is clear.
<milestone unit="page" n="189"/><milestone n="189a" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And therefore he who hears anything, hears some one thing and therefore hears what is.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And he who touches anything, touches some one thing, which is, since it is one?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>That also is true.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>So, then, does not he who holds an opinion hold an opinion of some one thing?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>He must do so.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And does not he who holds an opinion of some one thing hold an opinion of something that is?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>I agree.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then he who holds an opinion of what is not holds an opinion of nothing.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Evidently.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Well then, he who holds an opinion of nothing, holds no opinion at all.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>That is plain, apparently.
<milestone n="189b" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then it is impossible to hold an opinion of that which is not, either in relation to things that are, or independently of them.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Evidently.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then holding false opinion is something different from holding an opinion of that which is not?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>So it seems.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then false opinion is not found to exist in us either by this method or by that which we followed a little while ago.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>No, it certainly is not.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>But does not that which we call by that name arise after the following manner?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>After what manner?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>We say that false opinion is a kind of interchanged opinion,
<milestone n="189c" unit="section"/>when a person makes an exchange in his mind and says that one thing which exists is another thing which exists.  For in this way he always holds an opinion of what exists, but of one thing instead of another;  so he misses the object he was aiming at in his thought and might fairly be said to hold a false opinion.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Now you seem to me to have said what is perfectly right.  For when a man, in forming an opinion, puts ugly instead of beautiful, or beautiful instead of ugly, he does truly hold a false opinion.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Evidently, Theaetetus, you feel contempt of me, and not fear.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Why in the world do you say that?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>You think, I fancy, that I would not attack your &ldquo;truly false&rdquo;
<milestone n="189d" unit="section"/>by asking whether it is possible for a thing to become slowly quick or heavily light, or any other opposite, by a process opposite to itself, in accordance, not with its own nature, but with that of its opposite.  But I let this pass, that your courage may not fail.  You are satisfied, you say, that false opinion is interchanged opinion?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>I am.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>It is, then, in your opinion, possible for the mind to regard one thing as another and not as what it is.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes, it is.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Now when one's mind does this, does it not necessarily
<milestone n="189e" unit="section"/>have a thought either of both things together or of one or the other of them?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes, it must;  either of both at the same time or in succession.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Excellent.  And do you define thought as I do?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>How do you define it?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>As the talk which the soul has with itself about any subjects which it considers.  You must not suppose that I know this that I am declaring to you.  But the soul, as the image presents itself to me, when it thinks, is merely conversing with itself, asking itself questions and answering,
<milestone unit="page" n="190"/><milestone n="190a" unit="section"/>affirming and denying.  When it has arrived at a decision, whether slowly or with a sudden bound, and is at last agreed, and is not in doubt, we call that its opinion;  and so I define forming opinion as talking and opinion as talk which has been held, not with someone else, nor yet aloud, but in silence with oneself.  How do you define it?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>In the same way.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then whenever a man has an opinion that one thing is another, he says to himself, we believe, that the one thing is the other.
<milestone n="190b" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Now call to mind whether you have ever said to yourself that the beautiful is most assuredly ugly, or the wrong right, or&mdash;and this is the sum of the whole matter&mdash;consider whether you have ever tried to persuade yourself that one thing is most assuredly another, or whether quite the contrary is the case, and you have never ventured, even in sleep, to say to yourself that the odd is, after all, certainly even, or anything of that sort.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>You are right.
<milestone n="190c" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Do you imagine that anyone else, sane or insane, ever ventured to say to himself seriously and try to persuade himself that the ox must necessarily be a horse, or two one?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>No, by Zeus, I do not.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then if forming opinion is talking to oneself, no one who talks and forms opinion of two objects and apprehends them both with his soul, could say and have the opinion that one is the other.  But you will also have to give up the expression &ldquo;one and other.&rdquo;  This is what I mean, that nobody holds the opinion that the ugly is beautiful, or
<milestone n="190d" unit="section"/>anything of that sort.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Well, Socrates, I do give it up;  and I agree with you in what you say.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>You agree, therefore, that he who holds an opinion of both things cannot hold the opinion that one is the other.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>So it seems.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>But surely he who holds an opinion of one only, and not of the other at all, will never hold the opinion that one is the other.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>You are right;  for he would be forced to apprehend also that of which he holds no opinion.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then neither he who holds opinion of both nor he who holds it of one can hold the opinion that a thing is something else. 
<milestone n="190e" unit="section"/>And so anyone who sets out to define false opinion as interchanged opinion would be talking nonsense.  Then neither by this method nor by our previous methods is false opinion found to exist in us.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Apparently not.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>But yet, Theaetetus, if this is found not to exist, we shall be forced to admit many absurdities.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>What absurdities?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>I will not tell you until I have tried to consider the matter in every way.  For I should be ashamed of us, if, in our perplexity, we were forced to make such admissions as those to which I refer.  But if we find the object of our quest,
<milestone unit="page" n="191"/><milestone n="191a" unit="section"/>and are set free from perplexity, then, and not before, we will speak of others as involved in those absurdities, and we ourselves shall stand free from ridicule.  But if we find no escape from our perplexity, we shall, I fancy, become low-spirited, like seasick people, and shall allow the argument to trample on us and do to us anything it pleases.  Hear, then, by what means I still see a prospect of success for our quest.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Do speak.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>I shall deny that we were right when we agreed that it is impossible for a man to have opinion that the things he does not know are the things which he knows,
<milestone n="191b" unit="section"/>and thus to be deceived.  But there is a way in which it is possible.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Do you mean what I myself suspected when we made the statement to which you refer, that sometimes I, though I know Socrates, saw at a distance someone whom I did not know, and thought it was Socrates whom I do know?  In such a case false opinion does arise.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>But did not we reject that, because it resulted in our knowing and not knowing the things which we know?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Certainly we did.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Let us, then, not make that assumption, but another;  perhaps
<milestone n="191c" unit="section"/>it will turn out well for us, perhaps the opposite.  But we are in such straits that we must turn every argument round and test it from all sides.  Now see if this is sensible:  Can a man who did not know a thing at one time learn it later?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>To be sure he can.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Again, then, can he learn one thing after another?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Why not?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Please assume, then, for the sake of argument, that there is in our souls a block of wax, in one case larger, in another smaller, in one case the wax is purer, in another more impure and harder, in some cases softer,
<milestone n="191d" unit="section"/>and in some of proper quality.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>I assume all that.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Let us, then, say that this is the gift of Memory, the mother of the Muses, and that whenever we wish to remember anything we see or hear or think of in our own minds, we hold this wax under the perceptions and thoughts and imprint them upon it, just as we make impressions from seal rings;  and whatever is imprinted we remember and know as long as its image lasts, but whatever is rubbed out or
<milestone n="191e" unit="section"/>cannot be imprinted we forget and do not know.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Let us assume that.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Now take a man who knows the things which he sees and hears, and is considering some one of them;  observe whether he may not gain a false opinion in the following manner.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>In what manner?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>By thinking that the things which he knows are sometimes things which he knows and sometimes things which he does not know.  For we were wrong before in agreeing that this is impossible.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>What do you say about it now?
<milestone unit="page" n="192"/><milestone n="192a" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>We must begin our discussion of the matter by making the following distinctions:  It is impossible for anyone to think that one thing which he knows and of which he has received a memorial imprint in his soul, but which he does not perceive, is another thing which he knows and of which also he has an imprint, and which he does not perceive.  And, again, he cannot think that what he knows is that which he does not know and of which he has no seal;  nor that what he does not know is another thing which he does not know;  nor that what he does not know is what he knows;  nor can he think that what he perceives is something else which he perceives;  nor that what he perceives is something which he does not perceive;  nor that what he does not perceive is something else which he does not perceive;  nor that what he does not perceive
<milestone n="192b" unit="section"/>is something which he perceives.  And, again, it is still more impossible, if that can be, to think that a thing which he knows and perceives and of which he has an imprint which accords with the perception is another thing which he knows and perceives and of which he has an imprint which accords with the perception.  And he cannot think that what he knows and perceives and of which he has a correct memorial imprint is another thing which he knows;  nor that a thing which he knows and perceives and of which he has such an imprint is another thing which he perceives; 
<milestone n="192c" unit="section"/>nor again that a thing which he neither knows nor perceives is another thing which he neither knows nor perceives;  nor that a thing which he neither knows nor perceives is another thing which he does not know;  nor that a thing which he neither knows nor perceives is another thing which he does not perceive.  In all these cases it is impossible beyond everything for false opinion to arise in the mind of anyone.  The possibility that it may arise remains, if anywhere, in the following cases.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>What cases are they?  I hope they may help me to understand better;  for now I cannot follow you.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>The cases in which he may think that things which he knows are some other things which he knows and perceives;  or which he does not know, but perceives;  or that things which he knows and perceives are other things which
<milestone n="192d" unit="section"/>he knows and perceives.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Now I am even more out of the running than before.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then let me repeat it in a different way.  I know Theodorus and remember within myself what sort of a person he is, and just so I know Theaetetus, but sometimes I see them, and sometimes I do not, sometimes I touch them, sometimes not, sometimes I hear them or perceive them through some other sense, and sometimes I have no perception of you at all, but I remember you none the less and know you in my own mind.  Is it not so?
<milestone n="192e" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>This, then, is the first of the points which I wish to make clear.  Note that one may perceive or not perceive that which one knows.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>That is true.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>So, too, with that which he does not know&mdash;he may often not even perceive it, and often he may merely perceive it?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>That too is possible.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>See if you follow me better now.  If Socrates
<milestone unit="page" n="193"/><milestone n="193a" unit="section"/>knows Theodorus and Theaetetus, but sees neither of them and has no other perception of them, he never could have the opinion within himself that Theaetetus is Theodorus.  Am I right or wrong?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>You are right.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Now that was the first of the cases of which I spoke.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes, it was.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>The second is this:  knowing one of you and not knowing the other, and not perceiving either of you, I never could think that the one whom I know is the one whom I do not know.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Right.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And this is the third case:  not knowing and not perceiving either of you,
<milestone n="193b" unit="section"/>I could not think that he whom I do not know is someone else whom I do not know.  And imagine that you have heard all the other cases again in succession, in which I could never form false opinions about you and Theodorus, either when I know or do not know both of you, or when I know one and not the other;  and the same is true if we say &ldquo;perceive&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;know.&rdquo;  Do you follow me?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>I follow you.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then the possibility of forming false opinion remains in the following case:  when, for example, knowing you and Theodorus, and having on that block of wax
<milestone n="193c" unit="section"/>the imprint of both of you, as if you were signet-rings, but seeing you both at a distance and indistinctly, I hasten to assign the proper imprint of each of you to the proper vision, and to make it fit, as it were, its own footprint, with the purpose of causing recognition;<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb"><bibl n="Aesch. Lib. 197">Aesch. Lib. 197 ff.</bibl> makes Electra recognize the presence of her brother Orestes by the likeness of his footprints to her own.</note> but I may fail in this by interchanging them, and put the vision of one upon the imprint of the other, as people put a shoe on the wrong foot;  or, again, I may be affected as the sight is affected when we use a mirror and the sight as it flows makes a change from right to left,
<milestone n="193d" unit="section"/>and thus make a mistake;  it is in such cases, then, that interchanged opinion occurs and the forming of false opinion arises.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>I think it does, Socrates.  You describe what happens to opinion marvelously well.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>There is still the further case, when, knowing both of you, I perceive one in addition to knowing him, but do not perceive the other, and the knowledge which I have of that other is not in accord with my perception.  This is the case I described in this way before, and at that time you did not understand me.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>No, I did not.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>This is what I meant, that if anyone knows
<milestone n="193e" unit="section"/>and perceives one of you, and has knowledge of him which accords with the perception, he will never think that he is someone else whom he knows and perceives and his knowledge of whom accords with the perception.  That was the case, was it not?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>But we omitted, I believe, the case of which I am speaking now&mdash;the case in which we say the false opinion arises:  when a man knows both and sees both (or has some other perception of them),
<milestone unit="page" n="194"/><milestone n="194a" unit="section"/>but fails to hold the two imprints each under its proper perception;  like a bad archer he shoots beside the mark and misses it;  and it is just this which is called error or deception.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>And properly so.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Now when perception is present to one of the imprints but not to the other, and the mind applies the imprint of the absent perception to the perception which is present, the mind is deceived in every such instance.  In a word, if our present view is sound, false opinion or deception seems to be impossible in relation to things which one does not know
<milestone n="194b" unit="section"/>and has never perceived;  but it is precisely in relation to things which we know and perceive that opinion turns and twists, becoming false and true&mdash;true when it puts the proper imprints and seals fairly and squarely upon one another, and false when it applies them sideways and aslant.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Well, then, Socrates, is that view not a good one?
<milestone n="194c" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>After you have heard the rest, you will be still more inclined to say so.  For to hold a true opinion is a good thing, but to be deceived is a disgrace.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>They say the cause of these variations is as follows:  When the wax in the soul of a man is deep and abundant and smooth and properly kneaded, the images that come through the perceptions are imprinted upon this heart of the soul&mdash;as Homer calls it in allusion to its similarity to wax<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">The similarity is in the Greek words <foreign lang="greek">KE/AR</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">KH=R</foreign>, &ldquo;heart&rdquo;, and <foreign lang="greek">KHRO/S</foreign>, wax.  The shaggy heart is mentioned in the  <bibl n="Hom. Il. 2.851">Hom. Il. 2.851;</bibl>  <bibl n="Hom. Il. 16.554.">Hom. Il. 16.554</bibl>  The citation of Homer, here and below, is probably sarcastic&mdash;in reference to the practice of some of the sophists who used and perverted his words in support of their doctrines.</note>&mdash;;  when this is the case, and in such men, the imprints,
<milestone n="194d" unit="section"/>being clear and of sufficient depth, are also lasting.  And men of this kind are in the first place quick to learn, and secondly they have retentive memories, and moreover they do not interchange the imprints of their perceptions, but they have true opinions.  For the imprints are clear and have plenty of room, so that such men quickly assign them to their several moulds, which are called realities;  and these men, then, are called wise.  Or do you not agree?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Most emphatically.
<milestone n="194e" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Now when the heart of anyone is shaggy (a condition which the all-wise poet commends), or when it is unclean or of impure wax, or very soft or hard, those whose wax is soft are quick to learn, but forgetful, and those in whom it is hard are the reverse.  But those in whom it is shaggy and rough and stony, infected with earth or dung which is mixed in it, receive indistinct imprints from the moulds.  So also do those whose wax is hard;  for the imprints lack depth.  And imprints in soft wax are also indistinct, because
<milestone unit="page" n="195"/><milestone n="195a" unit="section"/>they melt together and quickly become blurred;  but if besides all this they are crowded upon one another through lack of room, in some mean little soul, they are still more indistinct.  So all these men are likely to have false opinions.  For when they see or hear or think of anything, they cannot quickly assign things to the right imprints, but are slow about it, and because they assign them wrongly they usually see and hear and think amiss.  These men, in turn, are accordingly said to be deceived about realities and ignorant.
<milestone n="195b" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>You are right as right could be, Socrates.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Shall we, then, say that false opinions exist in us?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Assuredly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And true opinions, no doubt?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>And true ones also.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then now at last we think we have reached a valid agreement, that these two kinds of opinion incontestably exist?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Most emphatically.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Truly, Theaetetus, a garrulous man is a strange and unpleasant creature!</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Eh?  What makes you say that?
<milestone n="195c" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Vexation at my own stupidity and genuine garrulity.  For what else could you call it when a man drags his arguments up and down because he is so stupid that he cannot be convinced, and is hardly to be induced to give up any one of them?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>But you, why are you vexed?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>I am not merely vexed, I am actually afraid;  for I do not know what answer to make if anyone asks me:  &ldquo;Socrates, have you found out, I wonder, that false opinion exists neither in the relations of the perceptions to one another nor in the thoughts,
<milestone n="195d" unit="section"/>but in the combination of perception with thought?&rdquo;  I shall say &ldquo;yes,&rdquo; I suppose, and put on airs, as if we had made a fine discovery.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>It seems to me, Socrates, that the result we have now brought out is not half bad.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>&ldquo;Do you go on and assert, then,&rdquo; he will say, &ldquo;that we never could imagine that the man whom we merely think of, but do not see, is a horse which also we do not see or touch or perceive by any other sense, but merely think of?&rdquo;  I suppose I shall say that I do make that assertion.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes, and you will be right.
<milestone n="195e" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; he will say, &ldquo;according to that, could we ever imagine that the number eleven which is merely thought of, is the number twelve which also is merely thought of?&rdquo;  Come now, it is for you to answer.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Well, my answer will be that a man might imagine the eleven that he sees or touches to be twelve, but that he could never have that opinion concerning the eleven that he has in his mind.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Well, then, do you think that anyone ever considered in his own mind five and seven,&mdash;
<milestone unit="page" n="196"/><milestone n="196a" unit="section"/>I do not mean by setting before his eyes seven men and five men and considering them, or anything of that sort, but seven and five in the abstract, which we say are imprints in the block of wax, and in regard to which we deny the possibility of forming false opinions&mdash;taking these by themselves, do you imagine that anybody in the world has ever considered them, talking to himself and asking himself what their sum is, and that one person has said and thought eleven, and another twelve, or do all say and think that it is twelve?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>No, by Zeus;  many say eleven,
<milestone n="196b" unit="section"/>and if you take a larger number for consideration, there is greater likelihood of error.  For I suppose you are speaking of any number rather than of these only.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>You are right in supposing so;  and consider whether in that instance the abstract twelve in the block of wax is not itself imagined to be eleven.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>It seems so.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Have we not, then, come back again to the beginning of our talk?  For the man who is affected in this way imagines that one thing which he knows is another thing which be knows.  This we said was impossible, and
<milestone n="196c" unit="section"/>by this very argument we were forcing false opinion out of existence, that the same man might not be forced to know and not know the same things at the same time.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Very true.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then we must show that forming false opinion is something or other different from the interchange of thought and perception.  For if it were that, we should never be deceived in abstract thoughts.  But as the case now stands, either there is no false opinion or it is possible for a man not to know that which he knows.  Which alternative will you choose?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>There is no possible choice, Socrates.
<milestone n="196d" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And yet the argument is not likely to admit both.  But still, since we must not shrink from any risk, what if we should try to do a shameless deed?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>What is it?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>To undertake to tell what it really is to know.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>And why is that shameless?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>You seem not to remember that our whole talk from the beginning has been a search for knowledge, because we did not know what it is.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Oh yes, I remember.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then is it not shameless to proclaim what it is to know, when we are ignorant of knowledge? 
<milestone n="196e" unit="section"/>But really, Theaetetus, our talk has been badly tainted with unclearness all along;  for we have said over and over again &ldquo;we know&rdquo; and &ldquo;we do not know&rdquo; and &ldquo;we have knowledge&rdquo; and &ldquo;we have no knowledge,&rdquo; as if we could understand each other, while we were still ignorant of knowledge;  and at this very moment, if you please, we have again used the terms &ldquo;be ignorant&rdquo; and &ldquo;understand,&rdquo; as though we had any right to use them if we are deprived of knowledge.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>But how will you converse, Socrates, if you refrain from these words?
<milestone unit="page" n="197"/><milestone n="197a" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Not at all, being the man I am;  but I might if I were a real reasoner;  if such a man were present at this moment he would tell us to refrain from these terms, and would criticize my talk scathingly.  But since we are poor creatures, shall I venture to say what the nature of knowing is?  For it seems to me that would be of some advantage.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Venture it then, by Zeus.  You shall have full pardon for not refraining from those terms.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Have you heard what they say nowadays that knowing is?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Perhaps;  however, I don't remember just at this moment.
<milestone n="197b" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>They say it is having knowledge.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>True.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Let us make a slight change and say possessing knowledge.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Why, how will you claim that the one differs from the other?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Perhaps it doesn't;  but first hear how it seems to me to differ, and then help me to test my view.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>I will if I can.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Well, then, having does not seem to me the same as possessing.  For instance, if a man bought a cloak and had it under his control, but did not wear it, we should certainly say, not that he had it, but that he possessed it.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>And rightly.
<milestone n="197c" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Now see whether it is possible in the same way for one who possesses knowledge not to have it, as, for instance, if a man should catch wild birds&mdash;pigeons or the like&mdash;and should arrange an aviary at home and keep them in it, we might in a way assert that he always has them because he possesses them, might we not?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And yet in another way that he has none of them, but that he has acquired power over them, since he has brought them under his control in his own enclosure,
<milestone n="197d" unit="section"/>to take them and hold them whenever he likes, by catching whichever bird he pleases, and to let them go again;  and he can do this as often as be sees fit.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>That is true.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Once more, then, just as a while ago we contrived some sort of a waxen figment in the soul, so now let us make in each soul an aviary stocked with all sorts of birds, some in flocks apart from the rest, others in small groups, and some solitary, flying hither and thither among them all.
<milestone n="197e" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Consider it done.  What next?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>We must assume that while we are children this receptacle is empty, and we must understand that the birds represent the varieties of knowledge.  And whatsoever kind of knowledge a person acquires and shuts up in the enclosure, we must say that he has learned or discovered the thing of which this is the knowledge, and that just this is knowing.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>So be it.
<milestone unit="page" n="198"/><milestone n="198a" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Consider then what expressions are needed for the process of recapturing and taking and holding and letting go again whichever he please of the kinds of knowledge, whether they are the same expressions as those needed for the original acquisition, or others.  But you will understand better by an illustration.  You admit that there is an art of arithmetic?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Now suppose this to be a hunt after the kinds of knowledge, or sciences, of all odd and even numbers.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>I do so.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Now it is by this art, I imagine, that a man has
<milestone n="198b" unit="section"/>the sciences of numbers under his own control and also that any man who transmits them to another does this.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And we say that when anyone transmits them he teaches, and when anyone receives them he learns, and when anyone, by having acquired them, has them in that aviary of ours, he knows them.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Now pay attention to what follows from this.  Does not the perfect arithmetician understand all numbers;  for he has the sciences of all numbers in his mind?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>To be sure.
<milestone n="198c" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then would such a man ever count anything&mdash;either any abstract numbers in his head, or any such external objects as possess number?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Of course,</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>But we shall affirm that counting is the same thing as considering how great any number in question is.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>We shall.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then he who by our previous admission knows all number is found to be considering that which he knows as if he did not know it.  You have doubtless heard of such ambiguities.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes, I have.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Continuing, then, our comparison with the acquisition
<milestone n="198d" unit="section"/>and hunting of the pigeons, we shall say that the hunting is of two kinds, one before the acquisition for the sake of possessing, the other carried on by the possessor for the sake of taking and holding in his hands what he had acquired long before.  And just so when a man long since by learning came to possess knowledge of certain things, and knew them, he may have these very things afresh by taking up again the knowledge of each of them separately and holding it&mdash;the knowledge which he had acquired long before, but had not at hand in his mind?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>That is true.
<milestone n="198e" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>This, then, was my question just now:  How should we express ourselves in speaking about them when an arithmetician undertakes to count or a man of letters to read something?  In such a case shall we say that although he knows he sets himself to learn again from himself that which he knows?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>But that is extraordinary, Socrates.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>But shall we say that he is going to read or count that which he does not know, when we have granted that he knows all letters and all numbers?
<milestone unit="page" n="199"/><milestone n="199a" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>But that too is absurd.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Shall we then say that words are nothing to us, if it amuses anyone to drag the expressions &ldquo;know&rdquo; and &ldquo;learn&rdquo; one way and another, but since we set up the distinction that it is one thing to possess knowledge and another thing to have it, we affirm that it is impossible not to possess what one possesses, so that it never happens that a man does not know that which he knows, but that it is possible to conceive a false opinion about it? 
<milestone n="199b" unit="section"/>For it is possible to have not the knowledge of this thing, but some other knowledge instead, when in hunting for some one kind of knowledge, as the various kinds fly about, he makes a mistake and catches one instead of another;  so in one example he thought eleven was twelve, because he caught the knowledge of twelve, which was within him, instead of that of eleven, caught a ringdove, as it were, instead of a pigeon.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes, that is reasonable.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>But when he catches the knowledge he intends to catch, he is not deceived and has true opinion, and so true and false opinion exist and none of the things
<milestone n="199c" unit="section"/>which formerly annoyed us interferes?  Perhaps you will agree to this;  or what will you do?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>I will agree.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Yes, for we have got rid of our difficulty about men not knowing that which they know;  for we no longer find ourselves not possessing that which we possess, whether we are deceived about anything or not.  However, another more dreadful disaster seems to be coming in sight.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>What disaster?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>If the interchange of kinds of knowledge should ever turn out to be false opinion.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>How so?
<milestone n="199d" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Is it not the height of absurdity, in the first place for one who has knowledge of something to be ignorant of this very thing, not through ignorance but through his knowledge;  secondly, for him to be of opinion that this thing is something else and something else is this thing&mdash;for the soul, when knowledge has come to it, to know nothing and be ignorant of all things?  For by this argument there is nothing to prevent ignorance from coming to us and making us know something and blindness from making us see, if knowledge is ever to make us ignorant.
<milestone n="199e" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Perhaps, Socrates, we were not right in making the birds represent kinds of knowledge only, but we ought to have imagined kinds of ignorance also flying about in the soul with the others;  then the hunter would catch sometimes knowledge and sometimes ignorance of the same thing, and through the ignorance he would have false, but through the knowledge true opinion.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>It is not easy, Theaetetus, to refrain from praising you.  However, examine your suggestion once more.  Let it be as you say: 
<milestone unit="page" n="200"/><milestone n="200a" unit="section"/>the man who catches the ignorance will, you say, have false opinion.  Is that it?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>But surely he will not also think that he has false opinion.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Certainly not.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>No, but true opinion, and will have the attitude of knowing that about which he is deceived.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Of course.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Hence he will fancy that he has caught, and has, knowledge, not ignorance.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Evidently.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then, after our long wanderings, we have come round again to our first difficulty.  For the real reasoner
<milestone n="200b" unit="section"/>will laugh and say, &ldquo;Most excellent Sirs, does a man who knows both knowledge and ignorance think that one of them, which he knows, is another thing which he knows;  or, knowing neither of them, is he of opinion that one, which he does not know, is another thing which he does not know;  or, knowing one and not the other, does he think that the one he does not know is the one he knows;  or that the one he knows is the one he does not know?  Or will you go on and tell me that there are kinds of knowledge of the kinds of knowledge and of ignorance, and that he who possesses these kinds of knowledge and has enclosed them in some sort of other ridiculous aviaries
<milestone n="200c" unit="section"/>or waxen figments, knows them, so long as he possesses them, even if he has them not at hand in his soul?  And in this fashion are you going to be compelled to trot about endlessly in the same circle without making any progress?&rdquo;  What shall we reply to this, Theaetetus?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>By Zeus, Socrates, I don't know what to say.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then, my boy, is the argument right in rebuking us and in pointing out that we were wrong to abandon knowledge and seek first for false opinion? 
<milestone n="200d" unit="section"/>It is impossible to know the latter until we have adequately comprehended the nature of knowledge.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>As the case now stands, Socrates, we cannot help thinking as you say.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>To begin, then, at the beginning once more, what shall we say knowledge is?  For surely we are not going to give it up yet, are we?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Not by any means, unless, that is, you give it up.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Tell us, then, what definition will make us contradict ourselves least.
<milestone n="200e" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>The one we tried before, Socrates;  at any rate, I have nothing else to offer.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>What one?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>That knowledge is true opinion;  for true opinion is surely free from error and all its results are fine and good.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>The man who was leading the way through the river,<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">A man who was leading the way through a river was asked if the water was deep.  He replied <foreign lang="greek">AU)TO\ DEI/CEI</foreign>, &ldquo;the event itself will show&rdquo; (i.e. you can find out by trying).  The expression became proverbial.</note> Theaetetus, said:  &ldquo;The result itself will show;&rdquo;  and so in this matter, if we go on with our search, perhaps the thing will turn up in our path and of itself reveal the object of our search;

What profession is it?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>The profession of those who are greatest in wisdom, who are called orators and lawyers;  for they persuade men by the art which they possess, not teaching them, but making them have whatever opinion they like.  Or do you think there are any teachers so clever as to be able, in the short time allowed by the water-clock,<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">The length of speeches in the Athenian law courts was limited by a water-clock.</note>
<milestone n="201b" unit="section"/>satisfactorily to teach the judges the truth about what happened to people who have been robbed of their money or have suffered other acts of violence, when there were no eyewitnesses?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>I certainly do not think so;  but I think they can persuade them.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And persuading them is making them have an opinion, is it not?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Of course.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then when judges are justly persuaded about matters which one can know only by having seen them and in no other way, in such a case, judging of them from hearsay, having acquired a true opinion of them,
<milestone n="201c" unit="section"/>they have judged without knowledge, though they are rightly persuaded, if the judgement they have passed is correct, have they not?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>But, my friend, if true opinion and knowledge were the same thing in law courts, the best of judges could never have true opinion without knowledge;  in fact, however, it appears that the two are different.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Oh yes, I remember now, Socrates, having heard someone make the distinction, but I had forgotten it.  He said that knowledge was true opinion accompanied by reason,
<milestone n="201d" unit="section"/>but that unreasoning true opinion was outside of the sphere of knowledge;  and matters of which there is not a rational explanation are unknowable&mdash;yes, that is what he called them&mdash;and those of which there is are knowable.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>I am glad you mentioned that.  But tell us how he distinguished between the knowable and the unknowable, that we may see whether the accounts that you and I have heard agree.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>But I do not know whether I can think it out;  but if someone else were to make the statement of it, I think I could follow.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Listen then, while I relate it to you&mdash;&ldquo;a dream for a dream.&rdquo;  I in turn
<milestone n="201e" unit="section"/>used to imagine that I heard certain persons say that the primary elements of which we and all else are composed admit of no rational explanation;  for each alone by itself can only be named, and no qualification can be added, neither that it is nor that it is not,
<milestone unit="page" n="202"/><milestone n="202a" unit="section"/>for that would at once be adding to it existence or non-existence, whereas we must add nothing to it, if we are to speak of that itself alone.  Indeed, not even &ldquo;itself&rdquo; or &ldquo;that&rdquo; or &ldquo;each&rdquo; or &ldquo;alone&rdquo; or &ldquo;this&rdquo; or anything else of the sort, of which there are many, must be added;  for these are prevalent terms which are added to all things indiscriminately and are different from the things to which they are added;  but if it were possible to explain an element, and it admitted of a rational explanation of its own, it would have to be explained apart from everything else.  But in fact none of the primal elements can be expressed by reason; 
<milestone n="202b" unit="section"/>they can only be named, for they have only a name;  but the things composed of these are themselves complex, and so their names are complex and form a rational explanation;  for the combination of names is the essence of reasoning.  Thus the elements are not objects of reason or of knowledge, but only of perception, whereas the combinations of them are objects of knowledge and expression and true opinion.  When therefore a man acquires without reasoning the true opinion about anything,
<milestone n="202c" unit="section"/>his mind has the truth about it, but has no knowledge;  for he who cannot give and receive a rational explanation of a thing is without knowledge of it;  but when he has acquired also a rational explanation he may possibly have become all that I have said and may now be perfect in knowledge.  Is that the version of the dream you have heard, or is it different?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>That was it exactly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Are you satisfied, then, and do you state it in this way, that true opinion accompanied by reason is knowledge?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Precisely.
<milestone n="202d" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Can it be, Theaetetus, that we now, in this casual manner, have found out on this day what many wise men have long been seeking and have grown grey in the search?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>I, at any rate, Socrates, think our present statement is good.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Probably this particular statement is so;  for what knowledge could there still be apart from reason and right opinion?  One point, however, in what has been said is unsatisfactory to me.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>What point?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Just that which seems to be the cleverest;  the assertion that the elements are unknowable and the class of combinations
<milestone n="202e" unit="section"/>is knowable.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Is that not right?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>We are sure to find out, for we have as hostages the examples which he who said all this used in his argument.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>What examples?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>The elements in writing, the letters of the alphabet, and their combinations, the syllables<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb"><foreign lang="greek">*STOIXEI=ON</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">SULLABH/</foreign> originally general terms for element and combination, became the common words for letter and syllable.</note>;  or do you think the author of the statements we are discussing had something else in view?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>No;  those are what he had in view.
<milestone unit="page" n="203"/><milestone n="203a" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Let us, then, take them up and examine them, or rather, let us examine ourselves and see whether it was in accordance with this theory, or not, that we learned letters.  First then, the syllables have a rational explanation, but the letters have not?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>I suppose so.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>I think so, too, decidedly.  Now if anyone should ask about the first syllable of Socrates;  &ldquo;Theaetetus, tell me, what is SO?&rdquo;  What would you reply?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>I should say &ldquo;S and O.&rdquo;</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>This, then, is your explanation of the syllable?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes.
<milestone n="203b" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Come now, in the same manner give me the explanation of the S.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>How can one give any elements of an element?  For really, Socrates, the S is a voiceless letter,<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">The distinction here made is that which we make between vowels and consonants.  The seven Greek vowels are <foreign lang="greek">A, E, H, I, O, U, W</foreign> called <foreign lang="greek">FWNH/ENTA</foreign>.</note> a mere noise, as of the tongue hissing;  B again has neither voice nor noise, nor have most of the other letters;  and so it is quite right to say that they have no explanation, seeing that the most distinct of them, the seven vowels, have only voice, but no explanation whatsoever.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>In this point, then, my friend, it would seem that we have reached a right conclusion about knowledge.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>I think we have.
<milestone n="203c" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>But have we been right in laying down the principle that whereas the letter is unknowable, yet the syllable is knowable?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Probably.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Well then, shall we say that the syllable is the two letters, or, if there be more than two, all of them, or is it a single concept that has arisen from their combination?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>I think we mean all the letters it contains.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Now take the case of two, S and O.  The two together are the first syllable of my name.  He who knows it knows the two letters, does he not?
<milestone n="203d" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Of course.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>He knows, that is, the S and the O.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>How is that?  He is ignorant of each, and knowing neither of them he knows them both?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>That is monstrous and absurd, Socrates.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And yet if a knowledge of each letter is necessary before one can know both, he who is ever to know a syllable must certainly know the letters first, and so our fine theory will have run away and vanished!
<milestone n="203e" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>And very suddenly, too.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Yes, for we are not watching it carefully.  Perhaps we ought to have said that the syllable is not the letters, but a single concept that has arisen from them, having a single form of its own, different from the letters.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Certainly;  and perhaps that will be better than the other way.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Let us look into that;  we must not give up in such unmanly fashion a great and impressive theory.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>No, we must not.
<milestone unit="page" n="204"/><milestone n="204a" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Let it be, then, as we say now, that the syllable or combination is a single form arising out of the several conjoined elements, and that it is the same in words and in all other things.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Therefore there must be no parts of it.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>How so?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Because if there are parts of anything, the whole must inevitably be all the parts;  or do you assert also that the whole that has arisen out of the parts is a single concept different from all the parts?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes, I do.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Do you then say that all and the whole are the same,
<milestone n="204b" unit="section"/>or that each of the two is different from the other?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>I am not sure;  but you tell me to answer boldly, so I take the risk and say that they are different.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Your boldness, Theaetetus, is right;  but whether your answer is so remains to be seen.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes, certainly, we must see about that.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>The whole, then, according to our present view, would differ from all?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>How about this?  Is there any difference between all in the plural and all in the singular?  For instance, if we say one, two, three,
<milestone n="204c" unit="section"/>four, five, six, or twice three, or three times two, or four and two, or three and two and one, are we in all these forms speaking of the same or of different numbers?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Of the same.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>That is, of six?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then in each form of speech we have spoken of all the six?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And again do we not speak of one thing when we speak of them all?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Assuredly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>That is, of six?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes.
<milestone n="204d" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then in all things that are made up of number, we apply the same term to all in the plural and all in the singular?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Apparently.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Here is another way of approaching the matter.  The number of the fathom and the fathom are the same, are they not?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And of the furlong likewise.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And the number of the army is the same as the army, and all such cases are alike?  In each of them all the number is all the thing.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And is the number of each anything but
<milestone n="204e" unit="section"/>the parts of each?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>No.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Everything that has parts, accordingly, consists of parts, does it not?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Evidently.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>But we are agreed that the all must be all the parts if all the number is to be the all.<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">Cf. <bibl n="Plat.

For that from which anything is lacking is neither a whole nor all, which have become identical simultaneously and for the same reason.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>I think now that there is no difference between all and whole.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>We were saying, were we not, that if there are parts of anything, the whole and all of it will be all the parts?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Once more, then, as I was trying to say just now, if the syllable is not the letters, does it not follow necessarily
<milestone n="205b" unit="section"/>that it contains the letters, not as parts of it, or else that being the same as the letters, it is equally knowable with them?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>It does.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And it was in order to avoid this that we assumed that it was different from them?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Well then, if the letters are not parts of the syllable, can you mention any other things which are parts of it, but are not the letters<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">The reader is reminded that words <foreign lang="greek">STOIXEI=ON</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">SULLABH/</foreign> have the meanings &ldquo;element&rdquo; and &ldquo;combination&rdquo; as well as &ldquo;letter&rdquo; and &ldquo;syllable.&rdquo;</note> of it?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Certainly not.  For if I grant that there are parts of the syllable, it would be ridiculous to give up the letters and look for other things as parts.
<milestone n="205c" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Without question, then, Theaetetus, the syllable would be, according to our present view, some indivisible concept.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>I agree.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Do you remember, then, my friend, that we admitted a little while ago, on what we considered good grounds, that there can be no rational explanation of the primary elements of which other things are composed, because each of them, when taken by itself, is not composite, and we could not properly apply to such an element even the expression &ldquo;be&rdquo; or &ldquo;this,&rdquo; because these terms are different and alien, and for this reason it is irrational and unknowable?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>I remember.
<milestone n="205d" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And is not this the sole reason why it is single in form and indivisible?  I can see no other.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>There is no other to be seen.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then the syllable falls into the same class with the letter, if it has no parts and is a single form?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes, unquestionably.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>If, then, the syllable is a plurality of letters and is a whole of which the letters are parts, the syllables and the letters are equally knowable and expressible, if all the parts were found to be the same as the whole.
<milestone n="205e" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>But if one and indivisible, then syllable and likewise letter are equally irrational and unknowable;  for the same cause will make them so.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>I cannot dispute it.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then we must not accept the statement of any one who says that the syllable is knowable and expressible, but the letter is not.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>No, not if we are convinced by our argument.
<milestone unit="page" n="206"/><milestone n="206a" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>But would you not rather accept the opposite belief, judging by your own experience when you were learning to read?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>What experience?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>In learning, you were merely constantly trying to distinguish between the letters both by sight and by hearing, keeping each of them distinct from the rest, that you might not be disturbed by their sequence when they were spoken or written.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>That is very true.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And in the music school was not perfect attainment
<milestone n="206b" unit="section"/>the ability to follow each note and tell which string produced it;  and everyone would agree that the notes are the elements of music?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes, that is all true.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then if we are to argue from the elements and combinations in which we ourselves have experience to other things in general, we shall say that the elements as a class admit of a much clearer knowledge than the compounds and of a knowledge that is much more important for the complete attainment of each branch of learning, and if anyone says that the compound is by its nature knowable and the element unknowable, we shall consider that he is, intentionally or unintentionally, joking.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Certainly.
<milestone n="206c" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Still other proofs of this might be brought out, I think;  but let us not on that account lose sight of the question before us, which is:  What is meant by the doctrine that the most perfect knowledge arises from the addition of rational explanation to true opinion?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>No, we must not.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Now what are we intended to understand by &ldquo;rational explanation&rdquo;?  I think it means one of three things.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>What are they?
<milestone n="206d" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>The first would be making one's own thought clear through speech by means of verbs and nouns, imaging the opinion in the stream that flows through the lips, as in a mirror or water.  Do you not think the rational explanation is something of that sort?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes, I do.  At any rate, we say that he who does that speaks or explains.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Well, that is a thing that anyone can do sooner or later;  he can show what he thinks about anything, unless he is deaf or dumb from the first;  and so
<milestone n="206e" unit="section"/>all who have any right opinion will be found to have it with the addition of rational explanation, and there will henceforth be no possibility of right opinion apart from knowledge.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>True.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Let us not, therefore, carelessly accuse him of talking nonsense who gave the definition of knowledge which we are now considering;  for perhaps that is not what he meant.  He may have meant that each person if asked about anything must be able in reply
<milestone unit="page" n="207"/><milestone n="207a" unit="section"/>to give his questioner an account of it in terms of its elements.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>As for example, Socrates?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>As, for example, Hesiod, speaking of a wagon, says, &ldquo;a hundred pieces of wood in a wagon.&rdquo;<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb"><bibl n="Hes.

<milestone n="207b" unit="section"/>holding a right opinion and expressing correctly what we have to say, but should think we were grammarians and as such both possessed and were expressing as grammarians would the rational explanation of the name Theaetetus.

That, I believe, is what was said before.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes, it was.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>So, too, he would say that we have right opinion about a wagon, but that he who can give an account of its essential nature
<milestone n="207c" unit="section"/>in terms of those one hundred parts has by this addition added rational explanation to true opinion and has acquired technical knowledge of the essential nature of a wagon, in place of mere opinion, by describing the whole in terms of its elements.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Do you agree to that, Socrates?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>If you, my friend, agree to it and accept the view that orderly description in terms of its elements is a rational account of anything, but that description in terms of syllables or still larger units is irrational,
<milestone n="207d" unit="section"/>tell me so, that we may examine the question.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Certainly I accept it.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Do you accept it in the belief that anyone has knowledge of anything when he thinks that the same element is a part sometimes of one thing and sometimes of another or when he is of opinion that the same thing has as a part of it sometimes one thing and sometimes another?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Not at all, by Zeus.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then do you forget that when you began to learn to read you and the others did just that?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Do you mean when we thought that sometimes one letter
<milestone n="207e" unit="section"/>and sometimes another belonged to the same syllable, and when we put the same letter sometimes into the proper syllable and sometimes into another?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>That is what I mean.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>By Zeus, I do not forget, nor do I think that those have knowledge who are in that condition.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Take an example:  When at such a stage in his progress a person in writing &ldquo;Theaetetus&rdquo; thinks he ought to write,
<milestone unit="page" n="208"/><milestone n="208a" unit="section"/>and actually does write, TH and E, and again in trying to write &ldquo;Theodorus&rdquo; thinks he ought to write, and does write, T and E, shall we say that he knows the first syllable of your names?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>No, we just now agreed that a person in such a condition has not yet gained knowledge.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then there is nothing to prevent the same person from being in that condition with respect to the second and third and fourth syllables?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>No, nothing.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then, in that case, he has in mind the orderly description in terms of letters, and will write &ldquo;Theaetetus&rdquo; with right opinion, when he writes the letters in order?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Evidently.
<milestone n="208b" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>But he is still, as we say, without knowledge, though he has right opinion?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Yes, but with his opinion he has rational explanation;  for he wrote with the method in terms of letters in his mind, and we agreed that that was rational explanation.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>True.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>There is, then, my friend, a combination of right opinion with rational explanation, which cannot as yet properly be called knowledge?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>There is not much doubt about it.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>So it seems that the perfectly true definition of knowledge, which we thought we had, was but a golden dream.

For there is still one left.  The first was a kind of vocal image of the thought, the second the orderly approach to the whole through the elements, which we have just been discussing, and what is the third?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>It is just the definition which most people would give, that knowledge is the ability to tell some characteristic by which the object in question differs from all others.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>As an example of the method, what explanation can you give me, and of what thing?
<milestone n="208d" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>As an example, if you like, take the sun:  I think it is enough for you to be told that it is the brightest of the heavenly bodies that revolve about the earth.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Understand why I say this.  It is because, as we were just saying, if you get hold of the distinguishing characteristic by which a given thing differs from the rest, you will, as some say, get hold of the definition or explanation of it;  but so long as you cling to some common quality, your explanation will pertain to all those objects to which the common quality belongs.
<milestone n="208e" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>I understand;  and it seems to me that it is quite right to call that kind a rational explanation or definition.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then he who possesses right opinion about anything and adds thereto a comprehension of the difference which distinguishes it from other things will have acquired knowledge of that thing of which he previously had only opinion.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>That is what we affirm.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Theaetetus, now that I have come closer to our statement, I do not understand it at all.  It is like coming close to a scene-painting.<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">In which perspective is the main thing.</note> While I stood off at a distance, I thought there was something in it.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>What do you mean?
<milestone unit="page" n="209"/><milestone n="209a" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>I will tell you if I can.  Assume that I have right opinion about you;  if I add the explanation or definition of you, then I have knowledge of you, otherwise I have merely opinion.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>But explanation was, we agreed, the interpretation of your difference.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>It was.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then so long as I had merely opinion, I did not grasp in my thought any of the points in which you differ from others?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Apparently not.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Therefore I was thinking of some one of the common traits which you possess no more than other men.
<milestone n="209b" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>You must have been.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>For heaven's sake!  How in the world could I in that case have any opinion about you more than about anyone else?  Suppose that I thought &ldquo;That is Theaetetus which is a man and has nose and eyes and mouth&rdquo; and so forth, mentioning all the parts.  Can this thought make me think of Theaetetus any more than of Theodorus or of the meanest of the Mysians,<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">The Mysians were despised as especially effeminate and worthless</note> as the saying is?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Of course not.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>But if I think not only of a man with nose and eyes,
<milestone n="209c" unit="section"/>but of one with snub nose and protruding eyes, shall I then have an opinion of you any more than of myself and all others like me?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Not at all.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>No;  I fancy Theaetetus will not be the object of opinion in me until this snubnosedness of yours has stamped and deposited in my mind a memorial different from those of the other examples of snubnosedness that I have seen, and the other traits that make up your personality have done the like.  Then that memorial, if I meet you again tomorrow, will awaken my memory and make me have right opinion about you.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Very true.
<milestone n="209d" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then right opinion also would have to do with differences in any given instance?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>At any rate, it seems so.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then what becomes of the addition of reason or explanation to right opinion?  For if it is defined as the addition of an opinion of the way in which a given thing differs from the rest, it is an utterly absurd injunction.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>How so?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>When we have a right opinion of the way in which certain things differ from other things, we are told to acquire a right opinion of the way in which those same things differ from other things!  On this plan the twirling of a scytale<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">A<foreign lang="greek">SKUTA/LH</foreign> was a staff, especially a staff about which a strip of leather was rolled, on which dispatches were so written that when unrolled they were illegible until rolled again upon another staff of the same size and shape.</note> or a pestle or anything of the sort would be as nothing
<milestone n="209e" unit="section"/>compared with this injunction.  It might more justly be called a blind man's giving directions;  for to command us to acquire that which we already have, in order to learn that of which we already have opinion, is very like a man whose sight is mightily darkened.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Tell me now, what did you intend to say when you asked the question a while ago?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>If, my boy, the command to add reason or explanation means learning to know and not merely getting an opinion about the difference, our splendid definition of knowledge would be a fine affair!  For learning to know is acquiring knowledge,
<milestone unit="page" n="210"/><milestone n="210a" unit="section"/>is it not?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then, it seems, if asked, &ldquo;What is knowledge?&rdquo; our leader will reply that it is right opinion with the addition of a knowledge of difference;  for that would, according to him, be the addition of reason or explanation.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>So it seems.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And it is utterly silly, when we are looking for a definition of knowledge, to say that it is right opinion with knowledge, whether of difference or of anything else whatsoever.  So neither perception, Theaetetus, nor true opinion, nor reason or explanation
<milestone n="210b" unit="section"/>combined with true opinion could be knowledge.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Apparently not.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Are we then, my friend, still pregnant and in travail with knowledge, or have we brought forth everything?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes, we have, and, by Zeus, Socrates, with your help I have already said more than there was in me.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then does our art of midwifery declare to us that all the offspring that have been born are mere wind-eggs and not worth rearing?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>It does, decidedly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>If after this you ever undertake to conceive other thoughts, Theaetetus, and do conceive,
<milestone n="210c" unit="section"/>you will be pregnant with better thoughts than these by reason of the present search, and if you remain barren, you will be less harsh and gentler to your associates, for you will have the wisdom not to think you know that which you do not know.  So much and no more my art can accomplish;  nor do I know aught of the things that are known by others, the great and wonderful men who are today and have been in the past.  This art, however, both my mother and I received from God, she for women and I for young and noble men and for all who are fair.
<milestone n="210d" unit="section"/>And now I must go to the Porch of the King, to answer to the suit which Meletus<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">Meletus was one of those who brought the suit which led to the condemnation and death of Socrates.</note> has brought against me.

What do you say, stranger?
<milestone n="217b" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Just what you did, Theodorus;  for I have no objection, and it is not difficult to say that they considered them three.  But it is no small or easy task to define clearly the nature of each.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theodorus</speaker><p>The fact is, Socrates, that by chance you have hit upon a question very like what we happened to be asking him before we came here; and he made excuses to us then, as he does now to you;  though he admits that he has heard it thoroughly discussed and remembers what he heard.
<milestone n="217c" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>In that case, stranger, do not refuse us the first favor we have asked;  but just tell us this:  Do you generally prefer to expound in a long uninterrupted speech of your own whatever you wish to explain to anyone, or do you prefer the method of questions?  I was present once when Parmenides employed the latter method and carried on a splendid discussion.  I was a young man then, and he was very old.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>The method of dialogue, Socrates, is easier
<milestone n="217d" unit="section"/>with an interlocutor who is tractable and gives no trouble;  but otherwise I prefer the continuous speech by one person.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Well, you may choose whomever you please of those present;  they will all respond pleasantly to you;  but if you take my advice you will choose one of the young fellows, Theaetetus here, or any of the others who suits you.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Socrates, this is the first time I have come among you, and I am somewhat ashamed, instead of carrying on the discussion by merely giving brief replies to your questions, to deliver an extended, long drawn out speech, either as an address of my own
<milestone n="217e" unit="section"/>or in reply to another, as if I were giving an exhibition;  but I must, for really the present subject is not what one might expect from the form of the question, but is a matter for very long speech.  On the other hand it seems unfriendly and discourteous to refuse a favor to you and these gentlemen, especially when you have spoken as you did.  As for

And if you get tired and are bored by the length of the talk, do not blame me, but these friends of yours.
<milestone n="218b" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Oh, no, I do not think I shall get tired of it so easily, but if such a thing does happen, we will call in this Socrates, the namesake of the other Socrates;  he is of my own age and my companion in the gymnasium, and is in the habit of working with me in almost everything.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Very well;  you will follow your own devices about that as the discussion proceeds;  but now you and I must investigate in common, beginning first, as it seems to me, with the sophist, and must search out and make plain
<milestone n="218c" unit="section"/>by argument what he is.  For as yet you and I have nothing in common about him but the name;  but as to the thing to which we give the name, we may perhaps each have a conception of it in our own minds;  however, we ought always in every instance to come to agreement about the thing itself by argument rather than about the mere name without argument.  But the tribe which we now intend to search for, the sophist, is not the easiest thing in the world to catch and define, and everyone has agreed long ago that if investigations of great matters are to be properly worked out we ought to practice them on small
<milestone n="218d" unit="section"/>and easier matters before attacking the very greatest.  So now, Theaetetus, this is my advice to ourselves, since we think the family of sophists is troublesome and hard to catch, that we first practise the method of hunting in something easier, unless you perhaps have some simpler way to suggest.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>I have not.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Then shall we take some lesser thing and try to use it as a pattern for the greater?
<milestone n="218e" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Well, then, what example can we set before us which is well known and small, but no less capable of definition than any of the greater things?  Say an angler;  is he not known to all and unworthy of any great interest?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes.
<milestone unit="page" n="219"/><milestone n="219a" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>But I hope he offers us a method and is capable of a definition not unsuitable to our purpose.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>That would be good.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Come now;  let us begin with him in this way:  Tell me, shall we say that he is a man with an art, or one without an art, but having some other power?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Certainly not one without an art.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>But of all arts there are, speaking generally, two kinds?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>How so?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Agriculture and all kinds of care of any living beings, and that which has to do with things which are put together or molded
<milestone n="219b" unit="section"/>(utensils we call them), and the art of imitation&mdash;all these might properly be called by one name.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>How so, and what is the name?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>When anyone brings into being something which did not previously exist, we say that he who brings it into being produces it and that which is brought into being is produced.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Now all the arts which we have just mentioned direct their energy to production.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes, they do.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Let us, then, call these collectively the productive art.
<milestone n="219c" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Agreed.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And after this comes the whole class of learning and that of acquiring knowledge, and money making, and fighting, and hunting.  None of these is creative, but they are all engaged in coercing, by deeds or words, things which already exist and have been produced, or in preventing others from coercing them;  therefore all these divisions together might very properly be called acquisitive art.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes, that would be proper.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Then since acquisitive and productive art comprise
<milestone n="219d" unit="section"/>all the arts, in which, Theaetetus, shall we place the art of angling?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>In acquisitive art, clearly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And are there not two classes of acquisitive art&mdash;one the class of exchange between voluntary agents by means of gifts and wages and purchases, and the other, which comprises all the rest of acquisitive art, and, since it coerces either by word or deed, might be called coercive?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>It appears so, at any rate, from what you have said.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Well then, shall we not divide coercive art into two parts?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>In what way?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>By calling all the open part of it fighting
<milestone n="219e" unit="section"/>and all the secret part hunting.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>But it would be unreasonable not to divide hunting into two parts.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Say how it can be done.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>By dividing it into the hunting of the lifeless and of the living.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Certainly, if both exist.
<milestone unit="page" n="220"/><milestone n="220a" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Of course they exist.  And we must pass over the hunting of lifeless things, which has no name, with the exception of some kinds of diving and the like, which are of little importance;  but the hunting of living things we will call animal-hunting.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Very well.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And two classes of animal-hunting might properly be made, one (and this is divided under many classes and names) the hunting of creatures that go on their feet, land-animal hunting, and the other that of swimming creatures, to be called, as a whole, water-animal hunting?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Certainly.
<milestone n="220b" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And of swimming creatures we see that one tribe is winged and the other is in the water?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Of course.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And the hunting of winged creatures is called, as a whole, fowling.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>It is.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And the hunting of water creatures goes by the general name of fishing.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And might I not divide this kind of hunting into two principal divisions?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>What divisions?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>The one carries on the hunt by means of enclosures merely, the other by a blow.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>What do you mean, and how do you distinguish the two?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>As regards the first, because whatever surrounds anything and encloses it
<milestone n="220c" unit="section"/>so as to constrain it is properly called an enclosure.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>May not, then, wicker baskets and seines and snares and nets and the like be called enclosures?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Assuredly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Then we will call this division hunting by enclosures, or something of that sort.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And the other, which is done with a blow, by means of hooks and three pronged spears, we must now&mdash;to name it with a single word&mdash;
<milestone n="220d" unit="section"/>call striking; or could a better name be found, Theaetetus?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Never mind the name;  that will do well enough.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Then the kind of striking which takes place at night by the light of a fire is, I suppose, called by the hunters themselves fire-hunting.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>To be sure.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And that which belongs to the daytime is, as a whole, barb-hunting, since the spears, as well as the hooks, are tipped with barbs.

<milestone n="222b" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>What do you mean?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Of land-hunting there are two chief divisions.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>What are they?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>One is the hunting of tame, the other of wild creatures.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Is there, then, a hunting of tame creatures?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Yes, If man is a tame animal;  but make any assumption you like, that there is no tame animal, or that some other tame animal exists but man is a wild one or that man is tame but there is no hunting of man.

<milestone n="222c" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Why, Stranger, I think we are a tame animal, and I agree that there is a hunting of man.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Let us, then, say that the hunting of tame animals is also of two kinds.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>How do we justify that assertion?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>By defining piracy, man-stealing, tyranny, and the whole art of war all collectively as hunting by force.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Excellent.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And by giving the art of the law courts, of the public platform, and of conversation also a single name and calling
<milestone n="222d" unit="section"/>them all collectively an art of persuasion.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Correct.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Now let us say that there are two kinds of persuasion.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>What kinds?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>The one has to do with private persons, the other with the community.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Granted;  each of them does form a class.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Then again of the hunting of private persons one kind receives pay, and the other brings gifts, does it not?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>I do not understand.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Apparently you have never yet paid attention to the lovers' method of hunting.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>In what respect?
<milestone n="222e" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>That in addition to their other efforts they give presents to those whom they hunt.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>You are quite right.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Let us, then, call this the amatory art.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Agreed.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>But that part of the paid kind which converses to furnish gratification and makes pleasure exclusively its bait and demands as its pay only maintenance, we might all agree, if I am not mistaken,
<milestone unit="page" n="223"/><milestone n="223a" unit="section"/>to call the art of flattery or of making things pleasant.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>But the class which proposes to carry on its conversations for the sake of virtue and demands its pay in cash&mdash;does not this deserve to be called by another name?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Of course.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And what is that name?  Try to tell.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>It is obvious; for I think we have discovered the sophist.  And therefore by uttering that word I think I should give him the right name.
<milestone n="223b" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Then, as it seems, according to our present reasoning, Theaetetus, the part of appropriative, coercive, hunting art which hunts animals, land animals, tame animals, man, privately, for pay, is paid in cash, claims to give education, and is a hunt after rich and promising youths, must&mdash;so our present argument concludes&mdash;be called sophistry.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Most assuredly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>But let us look at it in still another way;  for the class we are now examining
<milestone n="223c" unit="section"/>partakes of no mean art, but of a very many-sided one.  And we must indeed do so, for in our previous talk it presents an appearance of being, not what we now say it is, but another class.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>How so?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>The acquisitive art was of two sorts, the one the division of hunting, the other that of exchange.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes, it was.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Now shall we say that there are two sorts of exchange, the one by gift, the other by sale?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>So be it.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And we shall say further that exchange by sale is divided into two parts.
<milestone n="223d" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>How so?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>We make this distinction&mdash;calling the part which sells a man's own productions the selling of one's own, and the other, which exchanges the works of others, exchange.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Well, then, that part of exchange which is carried on in the city, amounting to about half of it, is called retailing, is it not?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And that which exchanges goods from city to city by purchase and sale is called merchandising?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And have we not observed that one part
<milestone n="223e" unit="section"/>of merchandising sells and exchanges for cash whatever serves the body for its support and needs, and the other whatever serves the soul?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>What do you mean by that?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Perhaps we do not know about the part that has to do with the soul;  though I fancy we do understand the other division.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes.
<milestone unit="page" n="224"/><milestone n="224a" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Take, therefore, the liberal arts<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">The word <foreign lang="greek">MOUSIKH/</foreign>, here rendered &ldquo;liberal arts,&rdquo; is much more inclusive than the English word &ldquo;music,&rdquo; designating, as it does, nearly all education and culture except the purely physical.

<milestone n="224b" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Then will you give the same name to him who buys up knowledge and goes about from city to city exchanging his wares for money?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>One part of this soul-merchandising might very properly be called the art of display, might it not?  But since the other part, though no less ridiculous than the first, is nevertheless a traffic in knowledge, must we not call it by some name akin to its business?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Now of this merchandising in knowledge
<milestone n="224c" unit="section"/>the part which has to do with the knowledge of the other arts should be called by one name, and that which has to do with virtue by another.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Of course.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>The name of art-merchant would fit the one who trades in the other arts, and now do you be so good as to tell the name of him who trades in virtue.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>And what other name could one give, without making a mistake, than that which is the object of our present investigation&mdash;the sophist?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>No other.  Come then, let us now summarize the matter by saying that sophistry has appeared a second time as that part of acquisitive art, art of exchange,
<milestone n="224d" unit="section"/>of trafficking, of merchandising, of soul-merchandising which deals in words and knowledge, and trades in virtue.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Very well.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>But there is a third case:  If a man settled down here in town and proposed to make his living by selling these same wares of knowledge, buying some of them and making others himself, you would, I fancy, not call him by any other name than that which you used a moment ago.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Certainly not.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Then also that part of acquisitive art which proceeds by exchange,
<milestone n="224e" unit="section"/>and by sale, whether as mere retail trade or the sale of one's own productions, no matter which, so long as it is of the class of merchandising in knowledge, you will always, apparently, call sophistry.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>I must do so, for I have to follow where the argument leads.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Let us examine further and see if the class we are now pursuing has still another aspect, of similar nature.
<milestone unit="page" n="225"/><milestone n="225a" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Of what nature?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>We agreed that fighting was a division of acquisitive art.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes, we did.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Then it is quite fitting to divide it into two parts.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Tell what the parts are.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Let us call one part of it the competitive and the other the pugnacious.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Agreed.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Then it is reasonable and fitting to give to that part of the pugnacious which consists of bodily contests some such name as violent.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And what other name than controversy
<milestone n="225b" unit="section"/>shall we give to the contests of words?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>No other.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>But controversy must be divided into two kinds.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>How?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Whenever long speeches are opposed by long speeches on questions of justice and injustice in public, that is forensic controversy.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>But that which is carried on among private persons and is cut up into little bits by means of questions and their answers, we are accustomed to call argumentation, are we not?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>We are.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And that part of argumentation which deals
<milestone n="225c" unit="section"/>with business contracts, in which there is controversy, to be sure, but it is carried on informally and without rules of art&mdash;all that must be considered a distinct class, now that our argument has recognized it as different from the rest, but it received no name from our predecessors, nor does it now deserve to receive one from us.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>True;  for the divisions into which it falls are too small and too miscellaneous.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>But that which possesses rules of art and carries on controversy about abstract justice and injustice and the rest in general terms, we are accustomed to call disputation, are we not?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Certainly.
<milestone n="225d" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Well, of disputation, one sort wastes money, the other makes money.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Then let us try to tell the name by which we must call each of these.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes, we must do so.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Presumably the kind which causes a man to neglect his own affairs for the pleasure of engaging in it, but the style of which causes no pleasure to most of his hearers, is, in my opinion, called by no other name than garrulity.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes, that is about what it is called.
<milestone n="225e" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Then the opposite of this, the kind which makes money from private disputes&mdash;try now, for it is your turn, to give its name.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>What other answer could one give without making a mistake, than that now again for the fourth time that wonderful being whom we have so long been pursuing has turned up&mdash;the sophist!
<milestone unit="page" n="226"/><milestone n="226a" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Yes, and  the  sophist is nothing  else, apparently, than the money-making class of the disputatious, argumentative, controversial, pugnacious, combative, acquisitive art, as our argument has now again stated.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Do you see the truth of the statement that this creature is many-sided and, as the saying is, not to be caught with one hand?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Then we must catch him with both.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Yes, we must, and must go at it with all our might,
<milestone n="226b" unit="section"/>by following another track of his&mdash;in this way.  Tell me;  of the expressions connected with menial occupations some are in common use, are they not?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes, many.  But to which of the many does your question refer?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>To such as these:  we say &ldquo;sift&rdquo; and &ldquo;strain&rdquo; and &ldquo;winnow&rdquo; and &ldquo;separate.&rdquo;<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">Apparently a term descriptive of some part of the process of weaving;  cf. <bibl n="Plat.

Is it not so?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Why do you use these as examples and ask about them all? 
<milestone n="226c" unit="section"/>What do you wish to show in regard to them?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>All those that I have mentioned imply a notion of division.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Then since there is, accorling to my reckoning, one art involved in all of these operations, let us give it one name.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>What shall we call it?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>The art of discrimination.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Very well.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Now see if we can discover two divisions of this.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>You demand quick thinking, for a boy like me.
<milestone n="226d" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And yet, in the instance of discrimination just mentioned there was, first, the separation of worse from better, and, secondly, of like from like.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes, as you now express it, that is pretty clear.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Now I know no common name for the second kind of discrimination;  but I do know the name of the kind which retains the better and throws away the worse.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>What is it?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Every such discrimination, as I think, is universally called a sort of purification.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes, so it is.
<milestone n="226e" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And could not anyone see that purification is of two kinds?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes, perhaps, in time;  but still I do not see it now.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Still there are many kinds of purifications of bodies, and they may all properly be included under one name.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>What are they and what is the name?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>The purification of living creatures, having to do with impurities within the body, such as are successfully discriminated by gymnastics and medicine,
<milestone unit="page" n="227"/><milestone n="227a" unit="section"/>and with those outside of the body, not nice to speak of, such as are attended to by the bath-keeper's art; and the purification of inanimate bodies, which is the special care of the fuller's art and in general of the art of exterior decoration;  this, with its petty subdivisions, has taken on many names which seem ridiculous.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Very.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Certainly they do, Theaetetus.  However, the method of argument is neither more nor less concerned with the art of medicine than with that of sponging, but is indifferent if the one benefits us little, the other greatly by its purifying. 
<milestone n="227b" unit="section"/>It endeavors to understand what is related and what is not related in all arts, for the purpose of acquiring intelligence;  and therefore it honors them all equally and does not in making comparisons think one more ridiculous than another, and does not consider him who employs, as his example of hunting, the art of generalship, any more dignified than him who employs the art of louse-catching, but only, for the most part, as more pretentious.  And now as to your question, what name we shall give to all the activities whose function it is to purify the body, whether animate or inanimate, it will not matter at all to our method
<milestone n="227c" unit="section"/>what name sounds finest;  it cares only to unite under one name all purifications of everything else and to keep them separate from the purification of the soul.  For it has in our present discussion been trying to separate this purification definitely from the rest, if we understand its desire.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>But I do understand and I agree that there are two kinds of purification and that one kind is the purification of the soul, which is separate from that of the body.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Most excellent.  Now pay attention to the next point
<milestone n="227d" unit="section"/>and try again to divide the term.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>In whatever way you suggest, I will try to help you in making the division.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Do we say that wickedness is distinct from virtue in the soul?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Of course.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And purification was retaining the one and throwing out whatever is bad anywhere?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes, it was.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Hence whenever we find any removal of evil from the soul, we shall be speaking properly if we call that a purification.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Very properly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>We must say that there are two kinds of evil in the soul.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>What kinds?
<milestone unit="page" n="228"/><milestone n="228a" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>The one is comparable to a disease in the body, the other to a deformity.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>I do not understand.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Perhaps you have not considered that disease and discord are the same thing?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>I do not know what reply I ought to make to this, either.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Is that because you think discord is anything else than the disagreement of the naturally related, brought about by some corruption?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>No;  I think it is nothing else.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>But is deformity anything else than the presence of the quality of disproportion, which is always ugly?
<milestone n="228b" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Nothing else at all.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Well then;  do we not see that in the souls of worthless men opinions are opposed to desires, anger to pleasures, reason to pain, and all such things to one another?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes, they are, decidedly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Yet they must all be naturally related.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Of course.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Then we shall be right if we say that wickedness is a discord and disease of the soul.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes, quite right.
<milestone n="228c" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>But if things which partake of motion and aim at some particular mark pass beside the mark and miss it on every occasion when they try to hit it, shall we say that this happens to them through right proportion to one another or, on the contrary, through disproportion?<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">The connection between disproportion and missing the mark is not obvious.

Shall we say that

<milestone n="229c" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>I at any rate think I do see one large and grievous kind of ignorance, separate from the rest, and as weighty as all the other parts put together.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>What is it?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Thinking that one knows a thing when one does not know it.

<milestone unit="page" n="230"/><milestone n="230a" unit="section"/>and sometimes more gently exhorting them&mdash;that would most properly be called as a whole admonition.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>That is true.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>On the other hand, some appear to have convinced themselves that all ignorance is involuntary, and that he who thinks himself wise would never be willing to learn any of those things in which he believes he is clever, and that the admonitory kind of education takes a deal of trouble and accomplishes little.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>They are quite right.
<milestone n="230b" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>So they set themselves to cast out the conceit of cleverness in another way.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>In what way?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>They question a man about the things about which he thinks he is talking sense when he is talking nonsense;  then they easily discover that his opinions are like those of men who wander, and in their discussions they collect those opinions and compare them with one another, and by the comparison they show that they contradict one another about the same things, in relation to the same things and in respect to the same things.  But those who see this grow angry with themselves and gentle towards others, and this is the way in which
<milestone n="230c" unit="section"/>they are freed from their high and obstinate opinions about themselves.  The process of freeing them, moreover, affords the greatest pleasure to the listeners and the most lasting benefit to him who is subjected to it.  For just as physicians who care for the body believe that the body cannot get benefit from any food offered to it until all obstructions are removed, so, my boy, those who purge the soul believe that the soul can receive no benefit from any teachings offered to it
<milestone n="230d" unit="section"/>until someone by cross-questioning reduces him who is cross-questioned to an attitude of modesty, by removing the opinions that obstruct the teachings, and thus purges him and makes him think that he knows only what he knows, and no more.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>That is surely the best and most reasonable state of mind.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>For all these reasons, Theaetetus, we must assert that cross-questioning is the greatest and most efficacious of all purifications, and that he who is not cross-questioned, even though he be the Great King,
<milestone n="230e" unit="section"/>has not been purified of the greatest taints, and is therefore uneducated and deformed in those things in which he who is to be truly happy ought to be most pure and beautiful.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Perfectly true.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Well then, who are those who practise this art? 
<milestone unit="page" n="231"/><milestone n="231a" unit="section"/>I am afraid to say the sophists.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Why so?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Lest we grant them too high a meed of honor.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>But the description you have just given is very like someone of that sort.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Yes, and a wolf is very like a dog, the wildest like the tamest of animals.  But the cautious man must be especially on his guard in the matter of resemblances, for they are very slippery things.  However, let us agree that they are the sophists;  for I think the strife will not be about petty discriminations
<milestone n="231b" unit="section"/>when people are sufficiently on their guard.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>No, probably not.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Then let it be agreed that part of the discriminating art is purification, and as part of purification let that which is concerned with the soul be separated off, and as part of this, instruction, and as part of instruction, education;  and let us agree that the cross-questioning of empty conceit of wisdom, which has come to light in our present discussion, is nothing else than the true-born art of sophistry.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p> Let us agree to all that;  but the sophist has by this time appeared to be so many things that I am at a loss
<milestone n="231c" unit="section"/>to know what in the world to say he really is, with any assurance that I am speaking the truth.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>No wonder you are at a loss.  But it is fair to suppose that by this time he is still more at a loss to know how he can any longer elude our argument;  for the proverb is right which says it is not easy to escape all the wrestler's grips.  So now we must attack him with redoubled vigor.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>You are right.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>First, then, let us stop to take breath and while we are resting let us count up
<milestone n="231d" unit="section"/>the number of forms in which the sophist has appeared to us.  First, I believe, he was found to be a paid hunter after the young and wealthy.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And secondly a kind of merchant in articles of knowledge for the soul.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And thirdly did he not turn up as a retailer of these same articles of knowledge?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes, and fourthly we found he was a seller of his own productions of knowledge.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Your memory is good;  but I will try to recall the fifth case myself.  He was an athlete
<milestone n="231e" unit="section"/>in contests of words, who had taken for his own the art of disputation.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes, he was.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>The sixth case was doubtful, but nevertheless we agreed to consider him a purger of souls, who removes opinions that obstruct learning.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Very true.
<milestone unit="page" n="232"/><milestone n="232a" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Then do you see that when a man appears to know many things, but is called by the name of a single art, there is something wrong about this impression, and that, in fact, the person who labors under this impression in connexion with any art is clearly unable to see the common principle of the art, to which all these kinds of knowledge pertain, so that he calls him who possesses them by many names instead of one?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Something like that is very likely to be the case.
<milestone n="232b" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>We must not let that happen to us in our search through lack of diligence.  So let us first take up again one of our statements about the sophist.  For there is one of them which seemed to me to designate him most plainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Which was it?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>I think we said he was a disputer.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And did we not also say that he taught this same art of disputing to others?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Now let us examine and see what the subjects are about which such men say they make their pupils able to dispute.  Let us begin our examination
<milestone n="232c" unit="section"/>at the beginning with this question:  Is it about divine things which are invisible to others that they make people able to dispute?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>That is their reputation, at any rate.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And how about the visible things of earth and heaven and the like?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Those are included, of course.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And furthermore in private conversations, when the talk is about generation and being in general, we know (do we not?) that they are clever disputants themselves and impart equal ability to others.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Certainly.
<milestone n="232d" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And how about laws and public affairs in general?  Do they not promise to make men able to argue about those?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes, for nobody, to speak broadly, would attend their classes if they did not make that promise.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>However in all arts jointly and severally what the professional ought to answer to every opponent is written down somewhere and published that he who will may learn.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>You seem to refer to the text-books of Protagoras
<milestone n="232e" unit="section"/>on wrestling and the other arts.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Yes, my friend, and to those of many other authors.  But is not the art of disputation, in a word, a trained ability for arguing about all things?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Well, at any rate, it does not seem to leave much out.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>For heaven's sake, my boy, do you think that is possible?  For perhaps you young people may look at the matter with sharper vision than our duller sight.
<milestone unit="page" n="233"/><milestone n="233a" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>What do you mean and just what do you refer to?  I do not yet understand your question.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>I ask whether it is possible for a man to know all things.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>If that were possible, Stranger, ours would indeed be a blessed race.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>How, then, can one who is himself ignorant say anything worth while in arguing with one who knows?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>He cannot at all.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Then what in the world can the magical power of the sophistical art be?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Magical power in what respect?
<milestone n="233b" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p> In the way in which they are able to make young men think that they themselves are in all matters the wisest of men.  For it is clear that if they neither disputed correctly nor seemed to the young men to do so, or again if they did seem to dispute rightly but were not considered wiser on that account, nobody, to quote from you,<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">Cf. <bibl n="Plat. Theaet. 232d">Plat. Theaet. 232d</bibl>.</note> would care to pay them money to become their pupil in these subjects.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Certainly not.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>But now people do care to do so?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Very much.
<milestone n="233c" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Yes, for they are supposed, I fancy, to have knowledge themselves of the things about which they dispute.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Of course.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And they do that about all things, do they not?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Then they appear to their pupils to be wise in all things.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>To be sure.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Though they are not;  for that was shown to be impossible.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Of course it is impossible.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Then it is a sort of knowledge based upon mere opinion that the sophist has been shown to possess about all things, not true knowledge.
<milestone n="233d" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Certainly;  and I shouldn't be surprised if that were the most accurate statement we have made about him so far.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Let us then take a clearer example to explain this.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>What sort of an example?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>This one;  and try to pay attention and to give a very careful answer to my question.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>What is the question?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>If anyone should say that by virtue of a single art he knew how, not to assert or dispute, but to do and make all things&mdash;
<milestone n="233e" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>What do you mean by all things?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>You fail to grasp the very beginning of what I said;  for apparently you do not understand the word &ldquo;all.&rdquo;</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>No, I do not.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>I mean you and me among the &ldquo;all,&rdquo; and the other animals besides, and the trees.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>What do you mean?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>If one should say that he would make you and me and all other created beings.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>What would he mean by &ldquo;making&rdquo;?  Evidently you will not say
<milestone unit="page" n="234"/><milestone n="234a" unit="section"/>that he means a husbandman;  for you said he was a maker of animals also.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Yes, and of sea and earth and heaven and gods and everything else besides;  and, moreover, he makes them all quickly and sells them for very little.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>This is some joke of yours.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Yes?  And when a man says that he knows all things and can teach them to another for a small price in a little time, must we not consider that a joke?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Surely we must.
<milestone n="234b" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And is there any more artistic or charming kind of joke than the imitative kind?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Certainly not;  for it is of very frequent occurrence and, if I may say so, most diverse.  Your expression is very comprehensive.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And so we recognize that he who professes to be able by virtue of a single art to make all things will be able by virtue of the painter's art, to make imitations which have the same names as the real things, and by showing the pictures at a distance will be able to deceive the duller ones among young children into the belief that he is perfectly able to accomplish in fact whatever he wishes to do.
<milestone n="234c" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Well then, may we not expect to find that there is another art which has to do with words, by virtue of which it is possible to bewitch the young through their ears with words while they are still standing at a distance from the realities of truth, by exhibiting to them spoken images of all things, so as to make it seem that they are true and that the speaker is the wisest of all men in all things?
<milestone n="234d" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Why should there not be such another art?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Now most of the hearers, Theaetetus, when they have lived longer and grown older, will perforce come closer to realities and will be forced by sad experience<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">Apparently a reference to a proverbial expression.  Cf. <bibl n="Hes. WD 216">Hes. WD 216</bibl> <foreign lang="greek">E)/GNW PAQW/N</foreign>; Herodotus, 1.207 <foreign lang="greek">TA\ PAQH/MATA MAQH/MATA</foreign>.</note> openly to lay hold on realities;  they will have to change the opinions which they had at first accepted, so that what was great will appear small and what was easy, difficult, and
<milestone n="234e" unit="section"/>all the apparent truths in arguments will be turned topsy-turvy by the facts that have come upon them in real life.  Is not this true?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes, at least so far as one of my age can judge.  But I imagine I am one of those who are still standing at a distance.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Therefore all of us elders here will try, and are now trying, to bring you as near as possible without the sad experience.  So answer this question about the sophist: 
<milestone unit="page" n="235"/><milestone n="235a" unit="section"/>Is this now clear, that he is a kind of a juggler, an imitator of realities, or are we still uncertain whether he may not truly possess the knowledge of all the things about which he seems to be able to argue?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>How could that be, my dear sir?  Surely it is pretty clear by this time from what has been said that he is one of those whose business is entertainment.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>That is to say, he must be classed as a juggler and imitator.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Of course he must.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Look sharp, then;  it is now our business not to let
<milestone n="235b" unit="section"/>the beast get away again, for we have almost got him into a kind of encircling net of the devices we employ in arguments about such subjects, so that he will not now escape the next thing.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>What next thing?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>The conclusion that he belongs to the class of conjurers.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p> I agree to that opinion of him, too.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>It is decided, then, that we will as quickly as possible divide the image-making art and go down into it, and if the sophist stands his ground against us at first, we will seize him by the orders of reason,
<milestone n="235c" unit="section"/>our king, then deliver him up to the king and display his capture.  But if he tries to take cover in any of the various sections of the imitative art, we must follow him, always dividing the section into which he has retreated, until he is caught.  For assuredly neither he nor any other creature will ever boast of having escaped from pursuers who are able to follow up the pursuit in detail and everywhere in this methodical way.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>You are right.  That is what we must do.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>To return, then, to our previous method of division,
<milestone n="235d" unit="section"/>I think I see this time also two classes of imitation, but I do not yet seem to be able to make out in which of them the form we are seeking is to be found.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Please first make the division and tell us what two classes you mean.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>I see the likeness-making art as one part of imitation.  This is met with, as a rule, whenever anyone produces the imitation by following the proportions of the original in length, breadth, and depth, and giving, besides,
<milestone n="235e" unit="section"/>the appropriate colors to each part.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes, but do not all imitators try to do this?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Not those who produce some large work of sculpture or painting.  For if they reproduced the true proportions of beautiful forms, the upper parts, you know, would seem smaller
<milestone unit="page" n="236"/><milestone n="236a" unit="section"/>and the lower parts larger than they ought, because we see the former from a distance, the latter from near at hand.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>So the artists abandon the truth and give their figures not the actual proportions but those which seem to be beautiful, do they not?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>That, then, which is other, but like, we may fairly call a likeness, may we not?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes.
<milestone n="236b" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And the part of imitation which is concerned with such things, is to be called, as we called it before, likeness-making?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>It is to be so called.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Now then, what shall we call that which appears, because it is seen from an unfavorable position, to be like the beautiful, but which would not even be likely to resemble that which it claims to be like, if a person were able to see such large works adequately?  Shall we not call it, since it appears, but is not like, an appearance?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And this is very common in painting
<milestone n="236c" unit="section"/>and in all imitation?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Of course.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And to the art which produces appearance, but not likeness, the most correct name we could give would be &ldquo;fantastic art,&rdquo; would it not?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>By all means.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>These, then, are the two forms of the image-making art that I meant, the likeness-making and the fantastic.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>You are right.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>But I was uncertain before in which of the two the sophist should be placed, and even now I cannot see clearly. 
<milestone n="236d" unit="section"/>The fellow is really wonderful and very difficult to keep in sight, for once more, in the very cleverest manner he has withdrawn into a baffling classification where it is hard to track him.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>So it seems.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Do you assent because you recognize the fact, or did the force of habit hurry you along to a speedy assent?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>What do you mean, and why did you say that?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>We are really, my dear friend, engaged in
<milestone n="236e" unit="section"/>a very difficult investigation;  for the matter of appearing and seeming, but not being, and of saying things, but not true ones&mdash;all this is now and always has been very perplexing.   You see, Theaetetus, it is extremely difficult to understand how a man is to say or think that falsehood really exists and in saying this not be involved
<milestone unit="page" n="237"/><milestone n="237a" unit="section"/>in contradiction.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Why?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>This statement involves the bold assumption that not-being exists, for otherwise falsehood could not come into existence.  But the great Parmenides, my boy, from the time when we were children to the end of his life, always protested against this and constantly repeated both in prose and in verse:<quote type="verse"><l met="dactylic">Never let this thought prevail, saith he, that not-being is;</l><l>But keep your mind from this way of investigation.</l></quote><bibl>Parmenides Fr. 7</bibl>
<milestone n="237b" unit="section"/>So that is his testimony, and a reasonable examination of the statement itself would make it most absolutely clear.  Let us then consider this matter first, if it's all the same to you.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Assume my consent to anything you wish.  Consider only the argument, how it may best be pursued;  follow your own course, and take me along with you.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Very well, then. Now tell me;  do we venture to use the phrase absolute not-being?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Of course.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>If, then, not merely for the sake of discussion or as a joke, but
<milestone n="237c" unit="section"/>seriously, one of his pupils were asked to consider and answer the question &ldquo;To what is the designation 'not-being' to be applied?&rdquo; how do we think he would reply to his questioner, and how would he apply the term, for what purpose, and to what object?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>That is a difficult question;  I may say that for a fellow like me it is unanswerable.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>But this is clear, anyhow, that the term &ldquo;not-being&rdquo; cannot be applied to any being.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Of course not.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And if not to being, then it could not properly be applied to something, either.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>How could it?
<milestone n="237d" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And this is plain to us, that we always use the word &ldquo;something&rdquo; of some being, for to speak of &ldquo;something&rdquo; in the abstract, naked, as it were, and disconnected from all beings is impossible, is it not?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes, it is.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>You assent because you recognize that he who says something must say some one thing?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And you will agree that &ldquo;something&rdquo; or &ldquo;some&rdquo; in the singular is the sign of one, in the dual of two, and in the plural of many.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Of course.
<milestone n="237e" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And he who says not something, must quite necessarily say absolutely nothing.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Quite necessarily.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Then we cannot even concede that such a person speaks, but says nothing?  We must even declare that he who undertakes to say &ldquo;not-being&rdquo; does not speak at all?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>The argument could go no further in perplexity.
<milestone unit="page" n="238"/><milestone n="238a" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Boast not too soon!  For there still remains, my friend, the first and greatest of perplexities.  It affects the very beginning of the matter.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>What do you mean?  Do not hesitate to speak.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>To that which is may be added or attributed some other thing which is?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Of course.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>But shall we assert that to that which is not anything which is can be attributed?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Certainly not.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Now we assume that all number is among the things which are.

<milestone n="238c" unit="section"/>plurality to them?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And in saying &ldquo;a thing which is not,&rdquo; do we not equally attribute the singular number?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Obviously.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And yet we assert that it is neither right nor fair to undertake to attribute being to not-being.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Very true.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Do you see, then, that it is impossible rightly to utter or to say or to think of not-being without any attribute, but it is a thing inconceivable, inexpressible, unspeakable, irrational?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Absolutely.
<milestone n="238d" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Then was I mistaken just now in saying that the difficulty I was going to speak of was the greatest in our subject.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>But is there a still greater one that we can mention?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Why, my dear fellow, don't you see, by the very arguments we have used, that not-being reduces him who would refute it to such difficulties that when he attempts to refute it he is forced to contradict himself?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>What do you mean?  Speak still more clearly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>You must not look for more clearness in me; 
<milestone n="238e" unit="section"/>for although I maintained that not-being could have nothing to do with either the singular or the plural number, I spoke of it just now, and am still speaking of it, as one;  for I say &ldquo;that which is not.&rdquo;  You understand surely?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And again a little while ago I said it was inexpressible, unspeakable,  irrational.   Do  you follow me?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes, of course.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Then when I undertook to attach the verb &ldquo;to be&rdquo; to not-being
<milestone unit="page" n="239"/><milestone n="239a" unit="section"/>I was contradicting what I said before.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Evidently.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Well, then;  when I attached this verb to it, did I not address it in the singular?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And when I called it irrational, inexpressible, and unspeakable, I addressed my speech to it as singular.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Of course you did.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>But we say that, if one is to speak correctly, one must not define it as either singular or plural, and must not even call it &ldquo;it&rdquo; at all;  for even by this manner of referring to it one would be giving it the form of the singular.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Certainly.
<milestone n="239b" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>But poor me, what can anyone say of me any longer?  For you would find me now, as always before, defeated in the refutation of not-being.  So, as I said before, we must not look to me for correctness of speech about not-being.  But come now, let us look to you for it.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>What do you mean?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Come, I beg of you, make a sturdy effort, young man as you are, and try with might and main to say something correctly about not-being, without attributing to it either existence or unity or plurality.
<milestone n="239c" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>But I should be possessed of great and absurd eagerness for the attempt, if I were to undertake it with your experience before my eyes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Well, if you like, let us say no more of you and me;  but until we find someone who can accomplish this, let us confess that the sophist has in most rascally fashion hidden himself in a place we cannot explore.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>That seems to be decidedly the case.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And so, if we say he has an art, as it were, of making appearances,
<milestone n="239d" unit="section"/>he will easily take advantage of our poverty of terms to make a counter attack, twisting our words to the opposite meaning;  when we call him an image-maker, he will ask us what we mean by &ldquo;image,&rdquo; exactly.  So, Theaetetus, we must see what reply is to be made to the young man's question.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Obviously we shall reply that we mean the images in water and in mirrors, and those in paintings, too, and sculptures, and all the other things of the same sort.
<milestone n="239e" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>It is evident, Theaetetus, that you never saw a sophist.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Why?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>He will make you think his eyes are shut or he has none at all.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>How so?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>When you give this answer, if you speak of something in mirrors or works of art, he will laugh at your words, when you talk to him as if he could see. 
<milestone unit="page" n="240"/><milestone n="240a" unit="section"/>He will feign ignorance of mirrors and water and of sight altogether, and will question you only about that which is deduced from your words.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>What is that?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>That which exists throughout all these things which you say are many but which you saw fit to call by one name, when you said &ldquo;image&rdquo; of them all, as if they were all one thing.  So speak and defend yourself.  Do not give way to the man at all.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Why, Stranger, what can we say an image is, except another such thing fashioned in the likeness of the true one?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Do you mean another such true one, or
<milestone n="240b" unit="section"/>in what sense did you say &ldquo;such&rdquo;?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Not a true one by any means, but only one like the true.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And by the true you mean that which really is?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Exactly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And the not true is the opposite of the true?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Of course.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>That which is like, then, you say does not really exist, if you say it is not true.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>But it does exist, in a way.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>But not truly, you mean.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>No, except that it is really a likeness.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Then what we call a likeness, though not really existing, really does exist?
<milestone n="240c" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Not-being does seem to have got into some such entanglement with being, and it is very absurd.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Of course it is absurd.  You see, at any rate, how by this interchange of words the many-headed sophist has once more forced us against our will to admit that not-being exists in a way.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes, I see that very well.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Well then, how can we define his art without contradicting ourselves?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Why do you say that?  What are you afraid of?
<milestone n="240d" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>When, in talking about appearance, we say that he deceives and that his art is an art of deception, shall we say that our mind is misled by his art to hold a false opinion, or what shall we say?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>We shall say that.  What else could we say?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>But, again, false opinion will be that which thinks the opposite of reality, will it not?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>You mean, then, that false opinion thinks things which are not?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Necessarily.
<milestone n="240e" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Does it think that things which are not, are not, or that things which are not at all, in some sense are?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>It must think that things which are not in some sense are&mdash;that is, if anyone is ever to think falsely at all, even in a slight degree.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And does it not also think that things which certainly are, are not at all?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And this too is falsehood?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes, it is,</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And therefore a statement will likewise be considered false,
<milestone unit="page" n="241"/><milestone n="241a" unit="section"/>if it declares that things which are, are not, or that things which are not, are.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>In what other way could a statement be made false?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Virtually in no other way;  but the sophist will not assent to this.  Or how can any reasonable man assent to it, when the expressions we just agreed upon were previously agreed to be inexpressible, unspeakable, irrational, and inconceivable?  Do we understand his meaning, Theaetetus?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p> Of course we understand that he will say we are contradicting our recent statements, since we dare to say that falsehood exists in opinions and words; 
<milestone n="241b" unit="section"/>for he will say that we are thus forced repeatedly to attribute being to not-being, although we agreed a while ago that nothing could be more impossible than that.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>You are quite right to remind me.  But I think it is high time to consider what ought to be done about the sophist;  for you see how easily and repeatedly he can raise objections and difficulties, if we conduct our search by putting him in the guild of false-workers and jugglers.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Very true.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Yes, we have gone through only a small part of them,
<milestone n="241c" unit="section"/>and they are, if I may say so, infinite.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>It would, apparently, be impossible to catch the sophist, if that is the case.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Well, then, shall we weaken and give up the struggle now?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>No, I say;  we must not do that, if we can in any way get the slightest hold of the fellow.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Will you then pardon me, and, as your words imply, be content if I somehow withdraw just for a short distance from this strong argument of his?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Of course I will.
<milestone n="241d" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>I have another still more urgent request to make of you.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>What is it?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Do not assume that I am becoming a sort of parricide.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>What do you mean?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>In defending myself I shall have to test the theory of my father Parmenides, and contend forcibly that after a fashion not-being is and on the other hand in a sense being is not.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>It is plain that some such contention is necessary.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Yes, plain even to a blind man, as they say;  for unless these statements
<milestone n="241e" unit="section"/>are either disproved or accepted, no one who speaks about false words, or false opinion&mdash;whether images or likenesses or imitations or appearances&mdash;about the arts which have to do with them, can ever help being forced to contradict himself and make himself ridiculous.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Very true.
<milestone unit="page" n="242"/><milestone n="242a" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And so we must take courage and attack our father's theory here and now, or else, if any scruples prevent us from doing this, we must give the whole thing up.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>But nothing in the world must prevent us.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Then I have a third little request to make of you.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>You have only to utter it.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>I said a while ago that I always have been too faint-hearted for the refutation of this theory, and so I am now.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes, so you did.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>I am afraid that on account of what I have said you will think I am mad because I have at once
<milestone n="242b" unit="section"/>reversed my position.  You see it is for your sake that I am going to undertake the refutation, if I succeed in it.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>I certainly shall not think you are doing anything improper if you proceed to your refutation and proof;  so go ahead boldly, so far as that is concerned.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Well, what would be a good beginning of a perilous argument?  Ah, my boy, I believe the way we certainly must take is this.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>What way?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>We must first examine the points which now seem clear,
<milestone n="242c" unit="section"/>lest we may have fallen into some confusion about them and may therefore carelessly agree with one another, thinking that we are judging correctly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Express your meaning more clearly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>It seems to me that Parmenides and all who ever undertook a critical definition of the number and nature of realities have talked to us rather carelessly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>How so?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Every one of them seems to tell us a story, as if we were children.  One says there are three principles, that some of them are sometimes waging a sort of war with each other, and sometimes
<milestone n="242d" unit="section"/>become friends and marry and have children and bring them up; and another says there are two, wet and dry or hot and cold, which he settles together and unites in marriage.<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">This refers apparently to Pherecydes and the early lonians.</note>  And the Eleatic sect in our region, beginning with Xenophanes and even earlier, have their story that all things, as they are called, are really one.  Then some Ionian<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">Heracleitus and his followers.</note> and later some Sicilian<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">Empedocles and his disciples.</note> Muses reflected
<milestone n="242e" unit="section"/>that it was safest to combine the two tales and to say that being is many and one, and is (or are) held together by enmity and friendship. For the more strenuous Muses say it is always simultaneously coming together and separating; but the gentler ones relaxed the strictness of the doctrine of perpetual strife; they say that the all is sometimes one and friendly, under the influence of Aphrodite,
<milestone unit="page" n="243"/><milestone n="243a" unit="section"/>and sometimes many and at variance with itself by reason of some sort of strife.  Now whether any of them spoke the truth in all this, or not, it is harsh and improper to impute to famous men of old such a great wrong as falsehood.  But one assertion can be made without offence.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>What is that?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>That they paid too little attention and consideration to the mass of people like ourselves.  For they go on to the end, each in his own way, without caring whether their arguments carry us along with them,
<milestone n="243b" unit="section"/>or whether we are left behind.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>What do you mean?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>When one of them says in his talk that many, or one, or two are, or have become, or are becoming, and again speaks of hot mingling with cold, and in some other part of his discourse suggests separations and combinations, for heaven's sake, Theaetetus, do you ever understand what they mean by any of these things?  I used to think, when I was younger, that I understood perfectly whenever anyone used this term &ldquo;not-being,&rdquo; which now perplexes us.  But you see what a slough of perplexity we are in about it now.
<milestone n="243c" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes, I see.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And perhaps our minds are in this same condition as regards being also;  we may think that it is plain sailing and that we understand when the word is used, though we are in difficulties about not-being, whereas really we understand equally little of both.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Perhaps.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And we may say the same of all the subjects about which we have been speaking.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>We will consider most of them
<milestone n="243d" unit="section"/>later, if you please, but now the greatest and foremost chief of them must be considered.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>What do you mean?  Or, obviously, do you mean that we must first investigate the term &ldquo;being,&rdquo; and see what those who use it think it signifies?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>You have caught my meaning at once, Theaetetus.  For I certainly do mean that this is the best method for us to use, by questioning them directly, as if they were present in person;  so here goes:  Come now, all you who say that hot and cold or any two such principles are the universe, what is this that you attribute to both of them
<milestone n="243e" unit="section"/>when you say that both and each are?  What are we to understand by this &ldquo;being&rdquo; (or &ldquo;are&rdquo;) of yours?  Is this a third principle besides those two others, and shall we suppose that the universe is three, and not two any longer, according to your doctrine?  For surely when you call one only of the two &ldquo;being&rdquo; you do not mean that both of them equally are;  for in both cases<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">&ldquo;In both cases,&rdquo; i.e. whether you say that one only is or that both are, they would both be one, namely being.</note> they would pretty certainly be one and not two.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>True.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Well, then, do you wish to call both of them together being?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Perhaps.
<milestone unit="page" n="244"/><milestone n="244a" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>But, friends, we will say, even in that way you would very clearly be saying that the two are one.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>You are perfectly right.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Then since we are in perplexity, do you tell us plainly what you wish to designate when you say &ldquo;being.&rdquo;  For it is clear that you have known this all along, whereas we formerly thought we knew, but are now perplexed.  So first give us this information, that we may not think we understand what you say, when the exact opposite is the case.&mdash;
<milestone n="244b" unit="section"/>If we speak in this way and make this request of them and of all who say that the universe is more than one, shall we, my boy, be doing anything improper?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Not in the least.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Well then, must we not, so far as we can, try to learn from those who say that the universe is one<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">The Eleatic Zeno and his school.</note> what they mean when they say &ldquo;being&rdquo;?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Of course we must.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Then let them answer this question:  Do you say that one only is?  We do, they will say;  will they not?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Well then, do you give the name of being to anything?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes.
<milestone n="244c" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Is it what you call &ldquo;one,&rdquo; using two names for the same thing, or how is this?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>What is their next answer, Stranger?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>It is plain, Theaetetus, that he who maintains their theory will not find it the easiest thing in the world to reply to our present question or to any other.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Why not?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>It is rather ridiculous to assert that two names exist when you assert that nothing exists but unity.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Of course it is.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And in general there would be no sense in accepting
<milestone n="244d" unit="section"/>the statement that a name has any existence.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Why?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Because he who asserts that the name is other than the thing, says that there are two entities.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And further, if he asserts that the name is the same as the thing, he will be obliged to say that it is the name of nothing, or if he says it is the name of something, the name will turn out to be the name of a name merely and of nothing else.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>True.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And the one will turn out to be the name of one and also the one of the name.<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">In other words, &ldquo;one,&rdquo; considered as a word, will be the name of unity, but considered as a reality, it will be the unity of which the word &ldquo;one&rdquo; is the name.   The sentence is made somewhat difficult of comprehension, doubtless for the purpose of indicating the confusion caused by the identification of the name wlth the thing.</note></p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Necessarily.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And will they say that the whole is other than the one which exists or the same with it?
<milestone n="244e" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Of course they will and do say it is the same.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>If then the whole is, as Parmenides says,<quote type="verse"><l met="dactylic">On all sides like the mass of a well-rounded sphere, equally weighted in every direction from the middle; for neither greater nor less must needs be on this or that,</l></quote><bibl>Parmenides Fr. 8.43</bibl>then being, being such as he describes it, has a center and extremes, and, having these, must certainly have parts, must it not?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Certainly.
<milestone unit="page" n="245"/><milestone n="245a" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>But yet nothing hinders that which has parts from possessing the attribute of unity in all its parts and being in this way one, since it is all and whole.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Very true.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>But is it not impossible for that which is in this condition to be itself absolute unity?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Why?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Why surely that which is really one must, according to right reason, be affirmed to be absolutely without parts.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes, it must.
<milestone n="245b" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>But such a unity consisting of many parts will not harmonize with reason.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>I understand.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Then shall we agree that being is one and a whole because it has the attribute of unity, or shall we deny that being is a whole at all?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>It is a hard choice that you offer me.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>That is very true;  for being, having in a way had unity imposed upon it, will evidently not be the same as unity, and the all will be more than one.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And further, if being is not a whole through
<milestone n="245c" unit="section"/>having had the attribute of unity imposed upon it, and the absolute whole exists, then it turns out that being lacks something of being.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And so, by this reasoning, since being is deprived of being, it will be not-being.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>So it will.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And again the all becomes more than the one, since being and the whole have acquired each its own nature.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>But if the whole does not exist at all, being is involved in the same difficulties as before, and besides not existing
<milestone n="245d" unit="section"/>it could not even have ever come into existence</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>What do you mean?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>That which comes into existence always comes into existence as a whole.  Therefore no one who does not reckon the whole among things that are can speak of existence or generation as being.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>That certainly seems to be true.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And moreover, that which is not a whole cannot have any quantity at all;  for if it has any quantity, whatever that quantity may be, it must necessarily be of that quantity as a whole.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Precisely.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And so countless other problems, each one involving infinite  difficulties,
<milestone n="245e" unit="section"/>will confront him who says that being is, whether it be two or only one.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>The problems now in sight make that pretty clear;  for each leads up to another which brings greater and more grievous wandering in connection with whatever has previously been said.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Now we have not discussed all those who treat accurately of being and not-being<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">The Ionic philosophers, the Eleatics, Heracleitus, Empedocles, the Megarians, Gorgias, Protagoras, and Antisthenes all discussed the problem of being and not-being.</note>;  however, let this suffice.  But we must turn our eyes to those whose doctrines are less precise, that we may know from all sources that it is no easier
<milestone unit="page" n="246"/><milestone n="246a" unit="section"/>to define the nature of being than that of not-being.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Very well, then, we must proceed towards those others also.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And indeed there seems to be a battle like that of the gods and the giants going on among them, because of their disagreement about existence.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>How so?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Some of them<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">The atomists (Leucippus, Democritus, and their followers), who taught that nothing exists except atoms and the void.  Possibly there is a covert reference to Aristippus who was, like Plato, a pupil of Socrates.</note> drag down everything from heaven and the invisible to earth, actually grasping rocks and trees with their hands;  for they lay their hands on all such things and maintain stoutly that that alone exists which can be touched and handled; 
<milestone n="246b" unit="section"/>for they define existence and body, or matter, as identical, and if anyone says that anything else, which has no body, exists, they despise him utterly, and will not listen to any other theory than their own.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Terrible men they are of whom you speak.  I myself have met with many of them.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Therefore those who contend against them defend themselves very cautiously with weapons derived from the invisible world above, maintaining forcibly that real existence consists of certain ideas which are only conceived by the mind and have no body.  But the bodies of their opponents, and that which is called by them truth, they break up into small fragments
<milestone n="246c" unit="section"/>in their arguments, calling them, not existence, but a kind of generation combined with motion.  There is always, Theaetetus, a tremendous battle being fought about these questions between the two parties.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>True.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Let us, therefore, get from each party in turn a statement in defence of that which they regard as being.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>How shall we get it?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>It is comparatively easy to get it from those who say that it consists in ideas, for they are peaceful folk; but from those who violently drag down everything
<milestone n="246d" unit="section"/>into matter, it is more difficult, perhaps even almost impossible, to get it.  However, this is the way I think we must deal with them.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>What way?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Our first duty would be to make them really better, if it were in any way possible;  but if this cannot be done, let us pretend that they are better, by assuming that they would be willing to answer more in accordance with the rules of dialectic than they actually are.  For the acknowledgement of anything by better men is more valid than if made by worse men.  But it is not these men that we care about;  we merely seek the truth.
<milestone n="246e" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Quite right.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Now tell them, assuming that they have become better, to answer you, and do you interpret what they say.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>I will do so.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Let them tell whether they say there is such a thing as a mortal animal.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Of course they do.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And they agree that this is a body with a soul in it, do they not?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Giving to soul a place among things which exist?
<milestone unit="page" n="247"/><milestone n="247a" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Well then, do they not say that one soul is just and another unjust, one wise and another foolish?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Of course.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And do they not say that each soul becomes just by the possession and presence of justice, and the opposite by the possession and presence of the opposite?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes, they agree to this also.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>But surely they will say that that which is capable of becoming present or absent exists.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes, they say that.
<milestone n="247b" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Granting, then, that justice and wisdom and virtue in general and their opposites exist, and also, of course, the soul in which they become present, do they say that any of these is visible and tangible, or that they are all invisible?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>That none of them is visible, or pretty nearly that.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Now here are some other questions.  Do they say they possess any body?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>They no longer answer the whole of that question in the same way.  They say they believe the soul itself has a sort of body, but as to wisdom and the other several qualities about which you ask, they have not the face either
<milestone n="247c" unit="section"/>to confess that they have no existence or to assert that they are all bodies.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>It is clear, Theaetetus, that our men have grown better;  for the aboriginal sons of the dragon's teeth<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">This refers to the story of Cadmus, who killed a dragon and then sowed its teeth, from which sprang fierce warriors to be his companions. Born of the dragon's teeth and of earth, they would naturally be of the earth, earthy.</note> among them would not shrink from any such utterance;  they would maintain that nothing which they cannot squeeze with their hands has any existence at all.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>That is pretty nearly what they believe.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Then let us question them further;  for if they are willing to admit that any existence, no matter how small, is incorporeal,
<milestone n="247d" unit="section"/>that is enough.  They will then have to tell what is which is inherent in the incorporeal and the corporeal alike, and which they have in mind when they say that both exit.  Perhaps they would be at a loss for an answer;  and if they are in that condition, consider whether they might not accept a suggestion if we offered it, and might not agree that the nature of being is as follows.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>What is it?  Speak, and we shall soon know.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>I suggest that everything which possesses any power of any kind, eithr to produce a change in anything of any nature
<milestone n="247e" unit="section"/>or to be affected even in the least degree by the slightest cause, though it be only on one occasion, has real existence.  For I set up as a definition which defines being, that it is nothing else but power.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p> Well, since they have at the moment nothing better of their own to offer, they accept this.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p> Good;  for perhaps later something else may occur to them and to us.  As between them
<milestone unit="page" n="248"/><milestone n="248a" unit="section"/>and us, then, let us asume that this is for the present agreed upon and settled.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p> It is settled.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p> Then let us go to the others, the friends of ideas;  and do you interpret for us their doctrines also.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p> I will.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p> You distinguish in your speech between generation and being, do you not?<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">i.e., between the process of coming into existence and existence itself.  It is difficult to determine exactly who the idealists are whose doctrines are here discussed.  Possibly Plato is restating or amending some of his own earlier beliefs.</note></p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes, we do.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And you say that with the body, by means of perception, we participate in generation, and with the soul, by means of thought, we participate in real being, which last is always unchanged and the same, whereas generation is different at different times.
<milestone n="248b" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes, that is what we say.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>But, most excellent men, how shall we define this participation which you attribute to both?  Is it not that of which we were just speaking?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>What is that?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>A passive or active condition arising out of some power which is derived from a combination of elements.  Possibly, Theaetetus, you do not hear their reply to this, but I hear it, perhaps, because I am used to them.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>What is it, then, that they say?
<milestone n="248c" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>They do not concede to us what we said just now to the aboriginal giants about being.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>What was it?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>We set up as a satisfactory sort of definition of being, the presence of the power to act or be acted upon in even the slightest degree.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>It is in reply to this that they say generation participates in the power of acting and of being acted upon, but that neither power is connected with being.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>And is there not something in that?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Yes, something to which we must reply that we still need
<milestone n="248d" unit="section"/>to learn more clearly from them whether they agree that the soul knows and that being is known.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>They certainly assent to that.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Well then, do you say that knowing or being known is an active or passive condition, or both?  Or that one is passive and the other active?  Or that neither has any share at all in either of the two?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Clearly they would say that neither has any share in either;  for otherwise they would be contradicting themselves.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>I understand;  this at least is true,
<milestone n="248e" unit="section"/>that if to know is active, to be known must in turn be passive.  Now being, since it is, according to this theory, known by the intelligence, in so far as it is known, is moved, since it is acted upon, which we say cannot be the case with that which is in a state of rest.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Right.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>But for heaven's sake, shall we let ourselves easily be persuaded that motion and life and soul and mind are really not present to absolute being, that it neither lives nor thinks,
<milestone unit="page" n="249"/><milestone n="249a" unit="section"/>but awful and holy, devoid of mind, is fixed and immovable?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>That would be a shocking admission to make, Stranger.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>But shall we say that it has mind, but not life?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>How can we?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>But do we say that both of these exist in it, and yet go on to say that it does not possess them in a soul?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>But how else can it possess them?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Then shall we say that it has mind and life and soul, but, although endowed with soul, is absolutely immovable?
<milestone n="249b" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>All those things seem to me absurd.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And it must be conceded that motion and that which is moved exist.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Of course.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Then the result is, Theaetetus, that if there is no motion, there is no mind in anyone about anything anywhere.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Exactly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And on the other hand, if we admit that all things are in flux and motion, we shall remove mind itself from the number of existing things by this theory also.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>How so?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Do you think that sameness of quality or nature
<milestone n="249c" unit="section"/>or relations could ever come into existence without the state of rest?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Not at all.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>What then?  Without these can you see how mind could exist or come into existence anywhere?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>By no means.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And yet we certainly must contend by every argument against him who does away with knowledge or reason or mind and then makes any dogmatic assertion about anything.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Then the philosopher, who pays the highest honor to these things, must necessarily, as it seems, because of them refuse to accept the theory of those who say the universe is at rest, whether as a unity or in many forms,
<milestone n="249d" unit="section"/>and must also refuse utterly to listen to those who say that being is universal motion;  he must quote the children's prayer,<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">Nothing further seems to he known about this prayer. Stallbaum thought the reference was to a game in which the children said <foreign lang="greek">O(/SA A)KI/NHTA KAI\ KEKINHME/NA EI)/H</foreign>, &ldquo;may all unmoved things be moved.&rdquo;</note> &ldquo;all things immovable and in motion,&rdquo; and must say that being and the universe consist of both.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Very true.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Do we not, then, seem to have attained at last a pretty good definition of being?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>But dear me, Theaetetus!  I think we are now going to discover the difficulty of the inquiry about being.
<milestone n="249e" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>What is this again?  What do you mean?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>My dear fellow, don't you see that we are now densely ignorant about it, but think that we are saying something worth while?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>I think so, at any rate, and I do not at all understand what hidden error we have fallen into.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Then watch more closely and see whether, if we make these admissions,
<milestone unit="page" n="250"/><milestone n="250a" unit="section"/>we may not justly be asked the same questions we asked a while ago of those who said the universe was hot and cold.<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">Cf. 242d above.</note></p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>What questions?  Remind me.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Certainly;  and I will try to do this by questioning you, as we questioned them at the time. I hope we shall at the same time make a little progress.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>That is right.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Very well, then;  you say that motion and rest are most directly opposed to each other, do you not?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Of course.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And yet you say that both and each of them equally exist?
<milestone n="250b" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes, I do.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And in granting that they exist, do you mean to say that both and each are in motion?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>By no means.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>But do you mean that they are at rest, when you say that both exist?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Of course not.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Being, then, you consider to be something else in the soul, a third in addition to these two, inasmuch as you think rest and motion are embraced by it;  and since you comprehend and observe that they participate in existence, you therefore said that they are.  Eh?
<milestone n="250c" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>We really do seem to have a vague vision of being as some third thing, when we say that motion and rest are.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Then being is not motion and rest in combination, but something else, different from them.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Apparently.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>According to its own nature, then, being is neither at rest nor in motion.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>You are about right.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>What is there left, then, to which a man can still turn his mind who wishes to establish within himself any clear conception of being?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>What indeed?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>There is nothing left, I think, to which he can turn easily.  For if
<milestone n="250d" unit="section"/>a thing is not in motion, it must surely be at rest;  and again, what is not at rest, must surely be in motion.  But now we find that being has emerged outside of both these classes.  Is that possible, then?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>No, nothing could be more impossible.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Then there is this further thing which we ought to remember.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>What is it?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>That when we were asked to what the appellation of not-being should be applied, we were in the greatest perplexity.  Do you remember?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Of course I do.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Well, then, are we now in any less perplexity
<milestone n="250e" unit="section"/>about being?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>It seems to me, stranger, that we are, if possible, in even greater.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>This point, then, let us put down definitely as one of complete perplexity.  But since being and not-being participate equally in the perplexity, there is now at last some hope that as either of them emerges more dimly or more clearly, so also will the other emerge. 
<milestone unit="page" n="251"/><milestone n="251a" unit="section"/>If, however, we are able to see neither of them, we will at any rate push our discussion through between both of them at once as creditably as we can.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Good.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Let us, then, explain how we come to be constantly calling this same thing by many names.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>What, for instance?  Please give an example.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>We speak of man, you know, and give him many additional designations;  we attribute to him colors and forms and sizes and vices and virtues,
<milestone n="251b" unit="section"/>and in all these cases and countless others we say not only that he is man, but we say he is good and numberless other things.  So in the same way every single thing which we supposed to be one, we treat as many and call by many names.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>True.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And it is in this way, I fancy, that we have provided a fine feast for youngsters and for old men whose learning has come to them late in life;  for example, it is easy enough for anyone to grasp the notion that the many cannot possibly be one, nor the one many, and so, apparently, they take pleasure in saying that we must not call a man good,
<milestone n="251c" unit="section"/>but must call the good good, and a man man.  I fancy, Theaetetus, you often run across people who take such matters seriously;  sometimes they are elderly men whose poverty of intellect makes them admire such quibbles, and who think this is a perfect mine of wisdom they have discovered.<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">Those are here satirized who deny the possibillty of all except identical predication.  Such were Antisthenes, Euthydemus, and Dionysodorus.  The two last are probably those referred to as old men whose learning came late in life.</note></p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Then, to include in our discussion all those who have ever engaged in any talk whatsoever about being,
<milestone n="251d" unit="section"/>let us address our present arguments to these men as well as to all those with whom we were conversing before, and let us employ the form of questions.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>What are the arguments?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Shall we attribute neither being to rest and motion, nor any attribute to anything, but shall we in our discussions assume that they do not mingle and cannot participate in one another?  Or shall we gather all things together, believing that they are capable of combining with one another?  Or are some capable of it and others not?  Which of these alternatives,
<milestone n="251e" unit="section"/>Theaetetus, should we say is their choice?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>I cannot answer these questions for them.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Then why did you not answer each separately and see what the result was in each case?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>A good suggestion.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And let us, if you please, assume that they say first that nothing has any power to combine with anything else.  Then motion and rest will have no share in being, will they?
<milestone unit="page" n="252"/><milestone n="252a" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>No.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Well, then, will either of them be, if it has no share in being?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>It will not.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>See how by this admission everything is overturned at once, as it seems&mdash;the doctrine of those who advocate universal motion, that of the partisans of unity and rest, and that of the men who teach that all existing things are distributed into invariable and everlasting kinds.  For all of these make use of being as an attribute.  One party says that the universe &ldquo;is&rdquo; in motion, another that it &ldquo;is&rdquo; at rest.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Exactly.
<milestone n="252b" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And further, all who teach that things combine at one time and separate at another, whether infinite elements combine in unity and are derived from unity or finite elements separate and then unite, regardless of whether they say that these changes take place successively or without interruption, would be talking nonsense in all these doctrines, if there is no intermingling.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Quite right.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Then, too, the very men who forbid us to call anything by another name because it participates in the effect produced by another, would be made most especially ridiculous by this doctrine.
<milestone n="252c" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>How so?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Because they are obliged in speaking of anything to use the expressions &ldquo;to be,&rdquo; &ldquo;apart,&rdquo; &ldquo;from the rest,&rdquo; &ldquo;by itself,&rdquo; and countless others;  they are powerless to keep away from them or avoid working them into their discourse; and therefore there is no need of others to refute them, but, as the saying goes, their enemy and future opponent is of their own household whom they always carry about with them as they go, giving forth speech from within them, like the wonderful Eurycles.<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">Eurycles was a ventriloquist and soothsayer of the fifth century, cf. <bibl n="Aristoph. Wasps 1019.">Aristoph. Wasps 1019</bibl></note>
<milestone n="252d" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>That is a remarkably accurate illustration</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>But what if we ascribe to all things the power of participation in one another?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Even I can dispose of that assumption.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>How?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Because motion itself would be wholly at rest, and rest in turn would itself be in motion, if these two could be joined with one another.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>But surely this at least is most absolutely impossible, that motion be at rest and rest be in motion?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Of course.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Then only the third possibility is left.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes.
<milestone n="252e" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And certainly one of these three must be true;  either all things will mingle with one another, or none will do so, or some will and others will not.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Of course.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And certainly the first two were found to be impossible.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Then everybody who wishes to answer correctly will adopt the remaining one of the three possibilities.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Precisely.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p> Now since some things will commingle and others will not,
<milestone unit="page" n="253"/><milestone n="253a" unit="section"/>they are in much the same condition as the letters of the alphabet;  for some of these do not fit each other, and others do.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Of course.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And the vowels, to a greater degree than the others, run through them all as a bond, so that without one of the vowels the other letters cannot be joined one to another.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Now does everybody know which letters can join with which others?  Or does he who is to join them properly have need of art?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>He has need of art.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>What art?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>The art of grammar.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And is not the same true in connection with high and
<milestone n="253b" unit="section"/>low sounds?  Is not he who has the art to know the sounds which mingle and those which do not, musical, and he who does not know unmusical?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And we shall find similar conditions, then, in all the other arts and processes which are devoid of art?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Of course.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Now since we have agreed that the classes or genera also commingle with one another, or do not commingle, in the same way, must not he possess some science and proceed by the processes of reason who is to show correctly which of the classes harmonize with which, and which reject one another,
<milestone n="253c" unit="section"/>and also if he is to show whether there are some elements extending through all and holding them together so that they can mingle, and again, when they separate, whether there are other universal causes of separation?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Certainly he needs science, and perhaps even the greatest of sciences.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Then, Theaetetus, what name shall we give to this science?  Or, by Zeus, have we unwittingly stumbled upon the science that belongs to free men and perhaps found the philosopher while we were looking for the sophist?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>What do you mean?
<milestone n="253d" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Shall we not say that the division of things by classes and the avoidance of the belief that the same class is another, or another the same, belongs to the science of dialectic?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes, we shall.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Then he who is able to do this has a clear perception of one form or idea extending entirely through many individuals each of which lies apart, and of many forms differing from one another but included in one greater form, and again of one form evolved by the union of many wholes,
<milestone n="253e" unit="section"/>and of many forms entirely apart and separate.  This is the knowledge and ability to distinguish by classes how individual things can or cannot be associated with one another.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Certainly it is.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>But you surely, I suppose, will not grant the art of dialectic to any but the man who pursues philosophy in purity and righteousness.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>How could it be granted to anyone else?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Then it is in some region like this that we shall always, both now and hereafter, discover the philosopher, if we look for him;

Don't you think so?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>It seems likely.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>But the philosopher, always devoting himself through reason to the idea of being, is also very difficult to see on account of the brilliant light of the place;  for the eyes
<milestone n="254b" unit="section"/>of the soul of the multitude are not strong enough to endure the sight of the divine.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>This also seems no less true than what you said about the sophist.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Now we will make more accurate investigations about the philosopher hereafter, if we still care to do so;  but as to the sophist, it is clear that we must not relax our efforts until we have a satisfactory view of him.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>You are right.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Since, therefore, we are agreed that some of the classes will mingle with one another, and others will not, and some will mingle with few and others with many, and that
<milestone n="254c" unit="section"/>there is nothing to hinder some from mingling universally with all, let us next proceed with our discussion by investigating, not all the forms or ideas, lest we become confused among so many, but some only, selecting them from those that are considered the most important; let us first consider their several natures, then what their power of mingling with one another is, and so, if we cannot grasp being and not-being with perfect clearness, we shall at any rate not fail to reason fully about them, so far as the method of our present inquiry permits.  Let us in this way see whether it is, after all,
<milestone n="254d" unit="section"/>permitted us to say that not-being really is, although not being, and yet come off unscathed.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes;  that is the proper thing for us to do.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>The most important, surely, of the classes or genera are those which we just mentioned;  being itself and rest and motion.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes, by far.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And further, two of them, we say, cannot mingle with each other.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Decidedly not.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>But being can mingle with both of them, for they both are.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Of course.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Then these prove to be three.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>To be sure.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Each of them is, then, other than the remaining two, but the same as itself.
<milestone n="254e" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>But what do we mean by these words, &ldquo;the same&rdquo; and &ldquo;other,&rdquo; which we have just used? Are they two new classes, different from the other three, but always of necessity mingled with them, and must we conduct our inquiry on the assumption that there are five classes, not three, or are we unconsciously speaking of one of those three
<milestone unit="page" n="255"/><milestone n="255a" unit="section"/>when we say &ldquo;the same&rdquo; or &ldquo;other&rdquo;?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Perhaps.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>But certainly motion and rest are neither other nor the same.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>How so?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Whatever term we apply to rest and motion in common cannot be either of those two.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Why not?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Because motion would be at rest and rest would be in motion;  in respect of both, for whichever of the two became &ldquo;other&rdquo; would force the other to change its nature into that of its opposite, since
<milestone n="255b" unit="section"/>it would participate in its opposite.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Exactly so.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Both certainly partake of the same and the other.<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">i.e., sameness and difference can he predicated of both.</note></p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Then we must not say that motion, or rest either, is the same or other.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>No.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>But should we conceive of &ldquo;being&rdquo; and &ldquo;the same&rdquo; as one?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Perhaps.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>But if &ldquo;being&rdquo; and &ldquo;the same&rdquo; have no difference of meaning, then when we go on and say that both rest and motion are, we shall be saying that they are both the same,
<milestone n="255c" unit="section"/>since they are.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>But surely that is impossible.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Then it is impossible for being and the same to be one.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Pretty nearly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>So we shall consider &ldquo;the same&rdquo; a fourth class in addition to the other three?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Then shall we call &ldquo;the other&rdquo; a fifth class?  Or must we conceive of this and &ldquo;being&rdquo; as two names for one class?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>May be.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>But I fancy you admit that among the entities some are always conceived as absolute, and some as relative.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Of course.
<milestone n="255d" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And other is always relative to other, is it not?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>It would not be so, if being and the other were not utterly different.  If the other, like being, partook of both absolute and relative existence, there would be also among the others that exist another not in relation to any other;  but as it is, we find that whatever is other is just what it is through compulsion of some other.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>The facts are as you say.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Then we must place the nature of &ldquo;the other&rdquo; as a fifth
<milestone n="255e" unit="section"/>among the classes in which we select our examples.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And we shall say that it permeates them all;  for each of them is other than the rest, not by reason of its own nature, but because it partakes of the idea of the other.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Exactly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Let us now state our conclusions, taking up the five classes one at a time.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>How?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Take motion first;  we say that it is entirely other than rest, do we not?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>We do.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Then it is not rest.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Not at all.
<milestone unit="page" n="256"/><milestone n="256a" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>But it exists, by reason of its participation in being.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes, it exists.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Now motion again is other than the same.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>You're about right.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Therefore it is not the same.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>No, it is not.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>But yet we found it was the same, because all things partake of the same.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Then we must admit that motion is the same and is not the same, and we must not be disturbed thereby;  for when we say it is the same and not the same, we do not use the words alike.  When we call it the same, we do so because it partakes
<milestone n="256b" unit="section"/>of the same in relation to itself, and when we call it not the same, we do so on account of its participation in the other, by which it is separated from the same and becomes not that but other, so that it is correctly spoken of in turn as not the same.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes, certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Then even if absolute motion partook in any way of rest, it would not be absurd to say it was at rest?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>It would be perfectly right, if we are to admit that some of the classes will mingle with one another, and others will not.
<milestone n="256c" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And surely we demonstrated that before we took up our present points;  we proved that it was according to nature.<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">See <bibl n="Plat.

Theaet. 251e ff</bibl></note></p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes, of course.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Then let us recapitulate:  Motion is other than the other, just as we found it to be other than the same and than rest.  Is that true?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Inevitably.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Then it is in a sense not other and also other, according to our present reasoning.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>True.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Now how about the next point?  Shall we say next that motion is other than the three, but not other than the fourth,&mdash;that is, if we have agreed that the classes
<milestone n="256d" unit="section"/>about which and within which we undertook to carry on our inquiry are five in number?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>How can we say that?  For we cannot admit that the number is less than was shown just now.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Then we may fearlessly persist in contending that motion is other than being?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes, most fearlessly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>It is clear, then, that motion really is not, and also that it is, since it partakes of being?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>That is perfectly clear.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>In relation to motion, then, not-being is.  That is inevitable.  And this extends to all the classes;  for in all of them
<milestone n="256e" unit="section"/>the nature of other so operates as to make each one other than being, and therefore not-being.  So we may, from this point of view, rightly say of all of them alike that they are not; and again, since they partake of being, that they are and have being.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes, I suppose so.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And so, in relation to each of the classes, being is many, and not-being is infinite in number.<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">Being is many, for each and every thing in all the classes is;  but not-being is infinite, for not only is it true that everything in each of the classes is not, but not-being extends also to all conceptions which do not and cannot have any reality.</note></p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>So it seems.
<milestone unit="page" n="257"/><milestone n="257a" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Then being itself must also be said to be other than all other things.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes, it must.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And we conclude that whatever the number of other things is, just that is the number of the things in relation to which being is not;  for not being those things, it is itself one, and again, those other things are not unlimited in number.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>That is not far from the truth.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Then we must not be disturbed by this either, since by their nature the classes have participation in one another.  But if anyone refuses to accept our present results, let him reckon with our previous arguments and then proceed to reckon with the next step.<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">i.e., if he will not accept our proof that being is not, etc., he must disprove our arguuents respecting the participation of idea in one another, and then proceed to draw his inference.</note></p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>That is very fair.
<milestone n="257b" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Then here is a point to consider.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>What is it?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>When we say not-being, we speak, I think, not of something that is the opposite of being, but only of something different.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>What do you mean?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>For instance, when we speak of a thing as not great, do we seem to you to mean by the expression what is small any more than what is of middle size?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>No, of course not.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Then when we are told that the negative signifies the opposite, we shall not admit it;  we shall admit only that the particle &ldquo;not&rdquo;<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">The two particles <foreign lang="greek">OU)</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">MH/</foreign> in Greek.</note> indicates something different
<milestone n="257c" unit="section"/>from the words to which it is prefixed, or rather from the things denoted by the words that follow the negative.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Let us consider another point and see if you agree with me.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>What is it?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>It seems to me that the nature of the other is all cut up into little bits, like knowledge.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>What do you mean?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Knowledge, like other, is one, but each separate part of it which applies to some particular subject
<milestone n="257d" unit="section"/>has a name of its own;  hence there are many arts, as they are called, and kinds of knowledge, or sciences.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes, certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And the same is true, by their nature, of the parts of the other, though it also is one concept.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Perhaps;  but let us discuss the matter and see how it comes about.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Is there a part of the other which is opposed to the beautiful?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>There is.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Shall we say that this is nameless or that it has a name?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>That it has one;  for that which in each case we call not-beautiful is surely the other of the nature of the beautiful and of nothing else.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Now, then, tell me something more.
<milestone n="257e" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>What?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Does it not result from this that the not-beautiful is a distinct part of some one class of being and also, again, opposed to some class of being?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Then, apparently, it follows that the not-beautiful is a contrast of being with being.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Quite right.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Can we, then, in that case, say that the beautiful is more and the not-beautiful less a part of being?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Not at all.
<milestone unit="page" n="258"/><milestone n="258a" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Hence the not-great must be said to be no less truly than the great?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>No less truly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And so we must recognize the same relation between the just and the not-just, in so far as neither has any more being than the other?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Of course.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And we shall, then, say the same of other things, since the nature of the other is proved to possess real being;  and if it has being, we must necessarily ascribe being in no less degree to its parts also.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Of course.
<milestone n="258b" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Then, as it seems, the opposition of the nature of a part of the other, and of the nature of being, when they are opposed to one another, is no less truly existence than is being itself, if it is not wrong for me to say so, for it signifies not the opposite of being, but only the other of being, and nothing more.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>That is perfectly clear.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Then what shall we call this?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Evidently this is precisely not-being, which we were looking for because of the sophist.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And is this, as you were saying, as fully endowed with being as anything else, and shall we henceforth say with confidence that not-being has an assured existence and a nature of its own? 
<milestone n="258c" unit="section"/>Just as we found that the great was great and the beautiful was beautiful, the not-great was not-great and the not-beautiful was not-beautiful, shall we in the same way say that not-being was and is not-being, to be counted as one class among the many classes of being?  Or have we, Theaetetus, any remaining distrust about the matter?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>None whatever.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Do you observe, then, that we have gone farther in our distrust of Parmenides than the limit set by his prohibition?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>What do you mean?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>We have proceeded farther in our investigation and have shown him more than that which he forbade us to examine.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>How so?
<milestone n="258d" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Because he says somewhere:<quote type="verse"><l met="dactylic">Never shall this thought prevail, that not-being is;</l><l>Nay, keep your mind from this path of investigation,</l></quote><bibl>Parmenides Fr. 7.1</bibl></p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes, that is what he says.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>But we have not only pointed out that things which are not exist, but we have even shown what the form or class of not-being is;  for we have pointed out that the nature of the other exists and is distributed in small bits
<milestone n="258e" unit="section"/>throughout all existing things in their relations to one another, and we have ventured to say that each part of the other which is contrasted with being, really is exactly not-being.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>And certainly, Stranger, I think that what we have said is perfectly true.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Then let not anyone assert that we declare that not-being is the opposite of being, and hence are so rash as to say that not-being exists.  For we long ago gave up speaking of any opposite of being, whether it exists or not and is capable
<milestone unit="page" n="259"/><milestone n="259a" unit="section"/>or totally incapable of definition.   But as for our present definition of not-being, a man must either refute us and show that we are wrong, or, so long as he cannot do that, he too must say, as we do, that the classes mingle with one another, and being and the other permeate all things, including each other, and the other, since it participates in being, is, by reason of this participation, yet is not that in which it participates, but other, and since it is other than being, must inevitably be not-being. 
<milestone n="259b" unit="section"/>But being, in turn, participates in the other and is therefore other than the rest of the classes, and since it is other than all of them, it is not each one of them or all the rest, but only itself;  there is therefore no doubt that there are thousands and thousands of things which being is not, and just so all other things, both individually and collectively, in many relations are, and in many are not.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>True.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And if any man has doubts about these oppositions, he must make investigations and advance better doctrines than
<milestone n="259c" unit="section"/>these of ours;  or if he finds pleasure in dragging words about and applying them to different things at different times, with the notion that he has invented something difficult to explain, our present argument asserts that he has taken up seriously matters which are not worth serious attention;  for this process is neither clever nor difficult, whereas here now is something both difficult and beautiful.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>What is it?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>What I have spoken of before&mdash;the ability to let those quibbles go as of no account and to follow and refute in detail the arguments of a man who says that other is in a sense the same, or that the same is other,
<milestone n="259d" unit="section"/>and to do this from that point of view and with regard for those relations which he presupposes for either of these conditions.  But to show that in some sort of fashion the same is the other, and the other the same, and the great small, and the like unlike, and to take pleasure in thus always bringing forward opposites in the argument,&mdash;all that is no true refutation, but is plainly the newborn offspring of some brain that has just begun to lay hold upon the problem of realities.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Exactly so.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>For certainly, my friend, the attempt to separate everything from everything else is not only not in good taste but also
<milestone n="259e" unit="section"/>shows that a man is utterly uncultivated and unphilosophical.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Why so?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>The complete separation of each thing from all is the utterly final obliteration of all discourse.  For our power of discourse is derived from the interweaving of the classes or ideas with one another.<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">The denial, that is to say, of all the interrelations of ideas leads to purely negative results.  Examples of this are the exclusive antithesis of being and not-being and the mutual exclusion of rest and motion.  The difficulty is solved at once when we recognize that positive and negative are necessarily interwoven in the nature of things, that the negative has only a relative existence and is not the opposite of the positive, but only different from it.</note></p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>True.
<milestone unit="page" n="260"/><milestone n="260a" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Observe, then, that we have now been just in time in carrying our point against the supporters of such doctrine, and in forcing them to admit that one thing mingles with another.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>What was our object?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Our object was to establish discourse as one of our classes of being.  For if we were deprived of this, we should be deprived of philosophy, which would be the greatest calamity;  moreover, we must at the present moment come to an agreement about the nature of discourse, and if we were robbed of it by its absolute non-existence, we could no longer discourse;  and we should be robbed of it
<milestone n="260b" unit="section"/>if we agreed that there is no mixture of anything with anything.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>That is true enough;  but I do not understand why we must come to an agreement about discourse just now.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Perhaps the easiest way for you to understand is by following this line of argument.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>What line?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>We found that not-being was one of the classes of being, permeating all being.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>So the next thing is to inquire whether it mingles with opinion and speech.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Why?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>If it does not mingle with them, the necessary result
<milestone n="260c" unit="section"/>is that all things are true, but if it does, then false opinion and false discourse come into being;  for to think or say what is not&mdash;that is, I suppose, falsehood arising in mind or in words.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>So it is.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>But if falsehood exists, deceit exists.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And if deceit exists, all things must be henceforth full of images and likenesses and fancies.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Of course.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>But we said that the sophist had
<milestone n="260d" unit="section"/>taken refuge in this region and had absolutely denied the existence of falsehood: for he said that not-being could be neither conceived nor uttered, since not-being did not in any way participate in being.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes, so it was.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>But now not-being has been found to partake of being, and so, perhaps, he would no longer keep up the fight in this direction;  but he might say that some ideas partake of not-being and some do not, and that speech and opinion are among those which do not;  and he would therefore again contend that the image-making and fantastic art,
<milestone n="260e" unit="section"/>in which we placed him, has absolutely no existence, since opinion and speech have no participation in not-being;  for falsehood cannot possibly exist unless such participation takes place.  For this reason we must first inquire into the nature of speech and opinion and fancy,<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">The English word &ldquo;fancy,&rdquo; though etymologically identical with the Greek <foreign lang="greek">FANTASI/A</foreign>, has lost the close connection with &ldquo;seeming&rdquo; (<foreign lang="greek">FAI/NESQAI</foreign>) which the Greek retains.

<milestone unit="page" n="261"/><milestone n="261a" unit="section"/>and when we have perceived that, may prove the existence of falsehood, and after proving that, may imprison the sophist therein, if he can be held on that charge, and if not, may set him free and seek him in another class.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>It certainly seems, Stranger, that what you said at first about the sophist&mdash;that he was a hard kind of creature to catch&mdash;is true;  for he seems to have no end of defences,<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">Perhaps a sort of pun is intended, for <foreign lang="greek">PRO/BLHMA</foreign> was already beginning to have the meaning of &ldquo;problem.&rdquo;</note> and when he throws one of them up, his opponent has first to fight through it before he can reach the man himself;  for now, you see, we have barely passed through
<milestone n="261b" unit="section"/>the non-existence of being, which was his first prepared line of defence, when we find another line ready;  and so we must prove that falsehood exists in relation to opinion and to speech;  and after this, perhaps, there will be another line, and still another after that;  and it seems no end will ever appear.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>No one should be discouraged, Theaetetus, who can make constant progress, even though it be slow.  For if a man is discouraged under these conditions, what would he do under others&mdash;if he did not get ahead at all or were even pressed back?  It would be a long time, as the saying is,
<milestone n="261c" unit="section"/>before such a man would ever take a city.  But now, my friend, since we have passed the line you speak of, the main defences would surely be in our hands, and the rest will now be smaller and easier to take.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Good.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>First, then, let us take up speech and opinion, as I said just now, in order to come to a clearer understanding whether not-being touches them, or they are both entirely true, and neither is ever false.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Very well.
<milestone n="261d" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Then let us now investigate names, just a we spoke a while ago about ideas and letters;  for in that direction the object of our present search is coming in sight.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>What do we need to understand about names?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Whether they all unite with one another, or none of them, or some will and some will not.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Evidently the last;  some will and some will not.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>This, perhaps, is what you mean, that those which are spoken in order
<milestone n="261e" unit="section"/>and mean something do unite, but those that mean nothing in their sequence do not unite.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>How so, and what do you mean by that?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>What I supposed you had in mind when you assented;  for we have two kinds of vocal indications of being.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>How so?
<milestone unit="page" n="262"/><milestone n="262a" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>One called nouns, the other verbs.<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">The science of language, in all its branches, was young in the time of Plato.  Words of general meaning were necessarily used in a technical sense.  So here <foreign lang="greek">O)/NOMA</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">R(H=MA</foreign> are used as parts of grammatical terminology in the sense of &ldquo;verb&rdquo; and &ldquo;noun,&rdquo; though Plato elsewhere employs them with their ordinary meanings.  Similarly the distinction between vowels and consonants (<bibl n="Plat. Theaet. 203">Plat. Theaet. 203</bibl>; cf. <bibl n="Plat. Soph. 253">Plat. Soph. 253</bibl>) was at least relatively new, as was that between the active and the passive voice.  How important Plato's part was in the development of linguistic study can no longer be accurately determined.</note></p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Define each of them.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>The indication which relates to action we may call a verb.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And the vocal sign applied to those who perform the actions in question we call a noun.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Exactly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Hence discourse is never composed of nouns alone spoken in succession, nor of verbs spoken without nouns.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>I do not understand that.
<milestone n="262b" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>I see;  you evidently had something else in mind when you assented just now;  for what I wished to say was just this, that verbs and nouns do not make discourse if spoken successively in this way.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>In what way?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>For instance, &ldquo;walks,&rdquo; &ldquo;runs,&rdquo; &ldquo;sleeps&rdquo; and the other verbs which denote actions, even if you utter all there are of them in succession, do not make discourse for all that.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>No, of course not.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And again, when &ldquo;lion,&rdquo; &ldquo;stag,&rdquo; &ldquo;horse,&rdquo; and all other names of those who perform these actions are uttered,
<milestone n="262c" unit="section"/>such a succession of words does not yet make discourse;  for in neither case do the words uttered indicate action or inaction or existence of anything that exists or does not exist, until the verbs are mingled with the nouns;  then the words fit, and their first combination is a sentence, about the first and shortest form of discourse.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>What do you mean by that?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>When one says &ldquo;a man learns,&rdquo; you agree that this is the least and first of sentences, do you not?
<milestone n="262d" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>For when he says that, he makes a statement about that which is or is becoming or has become or is to be;  he does not merely give names, but he reaches a conclusion by combining verbs with nouns. That is why we said that he discourses and does not merely give names, and therefore we gave to this combination the name of discourse.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>That was right.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>So, then, just as of things some fit each other and some do not, so too some vocal signs do not fit,
<milestone n="262e" unit="section"/>but some of them do fit and form discourse.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Now there is another little point.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>What is it?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>A sentence, if it is to be a sentence, must have a subject;  without a subject it is impossible.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>True.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And it must also be of some quality, must it not?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Of course.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Now let us pay attention to each other.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes, at any rate we ought to do so.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Now, then, I will speak a sentence to you in which a action and the result of action are combined by means of a noun and a verb, and whatever the subject of the sentence is do you tell me.

<milestone n="263b" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Now what quality shall be ascribed to each of these sentences?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>One is false, I suppose, the other true.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>The true one states facts as they are about you.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And the false one states things that are other than the facts.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>In other words, it speaks of things that are not as if they were.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes, that is pretty much what it does.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And states with reference to you that things are which are other than things which actually are;  for we said, you know, that in respect to everything there are many things that are and many that are not.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>To be sure.
<milestone n="263c" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Now the second of my sentences about you is in the first place by sheer necessity one of the shortest which conform to our definition of sentence.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>At any rate we just now agreed on that point.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And secondly it has a subject.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And if you are not the subject, there is none.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Certainly not.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And if there is no subject, it would not be a sentence at all;  for we showed that a sentence without a subject is impossible.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Quite right.
<milestone n="263d" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Now when things are said about you, but things other are said as the same and things that are not as things that are, it appears that when such a combination is formed of verbs and nouns we have really and truly false discourse.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes, very truly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Is it, then, not already plain that the three classes, thought, opinion, and fancy, all arise in our minds as both false and true?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>How is it plain?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>You will understand more easily if you first grap their natures
<milestone n="263e" unit="section"/>and the several differences between them.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Give me an opportunity.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Well, then, thought and speech are the same;  only the former, which is a silent inner conversation of the soul with itself, has been given the special name of thought.  Is not that true?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>But the stream that flows from the soul in vocal utterance through the mouth has the name of speech?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>True.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And in speech we know there is just&mdash;</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>What?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Affirmation and negation</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes, we know that.
<milestone unit="page" n="264"/><milestone n="264a" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Now when this arises in the soul silently by way of thought, can you give it any other name than opinion?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Certainly not.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And when such a condition is brought about in anyone, not independently, but through sensation, can it properly be called anything but seeming, or fancy?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>No.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Then since speech, as we found, is true and false, and we saw that thought is conversation of the soul with itself, and opinion is the final result of thought,
<milestone n="264b" unit="section"/>and what we mean when we say &ldquo;it seems&rdquo; is a mixture of sensation and opinion, it is inevitable that, since these are all akin to speech, some of them must sometimes be false.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Do you see, then, that false opinion and false discourse were found sooner than we expected when we feared a few moments ago that in looking for them we were undertaking an endless task?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes, I see.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Then let us not be discouraged about the rest of our search, either; 
<milestone n="264c" unit="section"/>for now that these points are settled, we have only to revert to our previous divisions into classes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>What divisions?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>We made two classes of image-making, the likeness-making and the fantastic.<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">See <bibl n="Plat.

Theaet. 235d ff</bibl></note></p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And we said that we did not know to which of the two the sophist should be assigned.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>You are right.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And in the midst of our perplexity about that, we were overwhelmed by a still greater dizziness when the doctrine appeared which challenges everybody and asserts that neither likeness nor image
<milestone n="264d" unit="section"/>nor appearance exists at all, because falsehood never exists anywhere in any way.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>True.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>But now, since the existence of false speech and false opinion has been proved, it is possible for imitations of realities to exist and for an art of deception to arise from this condition of mind.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes, it is possible.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And we decided some time ago that the sophist was in one of those two divisions of the image-making class.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Then let us try again;  let us divide in two
<milestone n="264e" unit="section"/>the class we have taken up for discussion, and proceed always by way of the right-hand part of the thing divided, clinging close to the company to which the sophist belongs, until, having stripped him of all common properties and left him only his own peculiar nature, we shall show him plainly first
<milestone unit="page" n="265"/><milestone n="265a" unit="section"/>to ourselves and secondly to those who are most closely akin to the dialectic method.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Right.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>We began by making two divisions of art, the productive and the acquisitive, did we not?<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">See <bibl n="Plat. Theaet. 219">Plat. Theaet. 219</bibl></note></p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And the sophist showed himself to us in the arts of hunting, contests, commerce, and the like, which were subdivisions of acquisitive art?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>But now, since imitative art has taken him over, it is clear that our first step must be the division of productive art into two parts; 
<milestone n="265b" unit="section"/>for imitative art is a kind of production&mdash;of images, however, we say, not of real things in each case.  Do you agree?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>By all means.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Then let us first assume two parts  of productive art.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>What are they?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>The divine and the human.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p> I don't yet understand.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>We said, if we remember the beginning of our conversation, that every power is productive which causes things to come into being which did not exist before.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes, we remember.
<milestone n="265c" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>There are all the animals, and all the plants that grow out of the earth from seeds and roots, and all the lifeless substances, fusible and infusible, that are formed within the earth.  Shall we say that they came into being, not having been before, in any other way than through God's workmanship?  Or, accepting the commonly expressed belief&mdash;</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>What belief?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>That nature brings them forth from some self-acting cause, without creative intelligence.  Or shall we say that they are created by reason and by divine knowledge that comes from God?
<milestone n="265d" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>I, perhaps because I am young, often change from one opinion to the other;  but now, looking at you and considering that you think they are created by God, I also adopt that view.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Well said, Theaetetus;  and if I thought you were one of those who would think differently by and by, I should try now, by argument and urgent persuasion, to make you agree with my opinion;  but since I understand your nature and see that it of itself inclines,
<milestone n="265e" unit="section"/>without any words of mine, towards that to which you say you are at present attracted, I will let that go;  for it would be a waste of time. But I will assume that things which people call natural are made by divine art, and things put together by man out of those as materials are made by human art, and that there are accordingly two kinds of art, the one human and the other divine.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Quite right.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Now that there are two, divide each of them again.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>How?
<milestone unit="page" n="266"/><milestone n="266a" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>You divided all productive art widthwise, as it were, before;  now divide it lengthwise.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Assume that it is done.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>In that way we now get four parts in all;  two belong to us and are human, and two belong to the gods and are divine.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And again, when the section is made the other way, one part of each half has to do with the making of real things, and the two remaining parts may very well be called image-making;  and so productive art is again divided into two parts.
<milestone n="266b" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Tell me again how each part is distinguished.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>We know that we and all the other animals, and fire, water, and their kindred elements, out of which natural objects are formed, are one and all the very offspring and creations of God, do we not?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And corresponding to each and all of these there are images, not the things themselves, which are also made by superhuman skill.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>What are they?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>The appearances in dreams, and those that arise by day and are said to be spontaneous&mdash;a shadow when
<milestone n="266c" unit="section"/>a dark object interrupts the firelight, or when twofold light, from the objects themselves and from outside, meets on smooth and bright surfaces and causes upon our senses an effect the reverse of our ordinary sight, thus producing an image.<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">This was the current explanation of reflection.  Mirrors and smooth objects were supposed to contain a luminous principle which met on the smooth surface with the light coming from the object reflected.  So in the act of vision the fire within the eye united with the external fire (<bibl n="Plat. Tim. 46a">Plat. Tim. 46a</bibl>).  The words <foreign lang="greek">TH=S E)/MPROSQEN . . . E)NANTI/AN AI)/SQHSIN</foreign> refer to the transposition of right and left in the reflection (cf. <bibl n="Plat. Theaet. 193c">Plat. Theaet. 193c</bibl>).</note></p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes, these are two works of divine creation, the thing itself and the corresponding image in each case.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And how about our own art?  Shall we not say that we make a house by the art of building, and by the art of painting make another house, a sort of man-made dream produced for those who are awake?
<milestone n="266d" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And in the same way, we say, all the other works of our creative activity also are twofold and go in pairs&mdash;the thing itself, produced by the art that creates real things, and the image, produced by the image-making art.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>I understand better now;  and I agree that there are two kinds of production, each of them twofold&mdash;the divine and the human by one method of bisection, and by the other real things and the product that consists of a sort of likenesses.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p> We must remember that there were to be two parts of the image-making class, the likeness-making and the fantastic,
<milestone n="266e" unit="section"/>if we should find that falsehood really existed and was in the class of real being.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes, there were.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>But we found that falsehood does exist, and therefore we shall now, without any doubts, number the kinds of image-making art as two, shall we not?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes.
<milestone unit="page" n="267"/><milestone n="267a" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Let us, then, again bisect the fantastic art.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>How?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>One kind is that produced by instruments, the other that in which the producer of the appearance offers himself as the instrument.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>What do you mean?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>When anyone, by employing his own person as his instrument, makes his own figure or voice seem similar to yours, that kind of fantastic art is called mimetic.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Let us, then, classify this part under the name of mimetic art;  but as for all the rest, let us be so self-indulgent as to let it go
<milestone n="267b" unit="section"/>and leave it for someone else to unify and name appropriately.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Very well, let us adopt that classification and let the other part go.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>But it is surely worth while to consider, Theaetetus, that the mimetic art also has two parts;  and I will tell you why.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Please do.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Some who imitate do so with knowledge of that which they imitate, and others without such knowledge.  And yet what division can we imagine more complete than that which separates knowledge and ignorance?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>None.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>The example I just gave was of imitation by those who know, was it not?  For a man who imitates you would know you and your figure.
<milestone n="267c" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Of course.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>But what of the figure of justice and, in a word, of virtue in general?  Are there not many who have no knowledge of it, but only a sort of opinion, and who try with the greatest eagerness to make this which they themselves think is virtue seem to exist within them, by imitating it in acts and words to the best of their ability?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes, there are very many such people.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Do all of them, then, fail in the attempt to seem to be just when they are not so at all?  Or is quite the opposite the case?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Quite the opposite.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Then I think we must say that such an imitator is quite distinct from the other,
<milestone n="267d" unit="section"/>the one who does not know from the one who knows.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Where, then, can the fitting name for each of the two be found?  Clearly it is not an easy task, because there was, it seems, among the earlier thinkers a long established and careless indolence in respect to the division of classes or genera into forms or species, so that nobody even tried to make such divisions;  therefore there cannot be a great abundance of names.  However, even though the innovation in language be a trifle bold, let us, for the sake of making a distinction, call the imitation which is based on opinion, oplnion-imitation,
<milestone n="267e" unit="section"/>and that which is founded on knowledge, a sort of scientific imitation.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Agreed.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>We mat therefore apply ourselves to the former, for we found that the sophist was among those who imitate but was not among those who know.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Very true.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Then let us examine the opinion-imitator as if he were a piece of iron, and see whether he is sound or there is still some seam in him.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Let us do so.
<milestone unit="page" n="268"/><milestone n="268a" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Well, there is a very marked seam.  For some of these imitators are simple-minded and think they know that about which they have only opinion, but the other kind because of their experience in the rough and tumble of arguments, strongly suspect and fear that they are ignorant of the things which they pretend before the public to know.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>Certainly the two classes you mention both exist.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Then shall we call one the simple imitator and the other the dissembling imitator?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>That is reaonable, at any rate.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And shall we say that the latter forms one class or two again?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>That is your affair.
<milestone n="268b" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>I am considering, and I think I can see two classes I see one who can dissemble in long speeches in public before a multitude, and the other who does it in private in short speeches and forces the person who converses with him to contradict himself.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theaetetus</speaker><p>You are quite right.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And what name shall we give to him who makes the longer speeches?

<milestone unit="page" n="257"/><milestone n="257a" unit="section"/><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Really I am greatly indebted to you, Theodorus, for my acquaintance with Theaetetus and with the Stranger, too.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theodorus</speaker><p>Presently, Socrates, you will be three times as much indebted, when they have worked out the statesman and the philosopher for you.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Indeed!  My dear Theodorus, can I believe my ears?  Were those really the words of the great calculator and geometrician?
<milestone n="257b" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Theodorus</speaker><p>Why, what do you mean, Socrates?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>When you rated sophist, statesman, and philosopher at the same value, though they are farther apart in worth than your mathematical proportion can express.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theodorus</speaker><p>By Ammon, our special divinity,<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">Theodorus was from <placeName key="tgn,7000639">Cyrene</placeName>, not far from the oasis of Ammon.</note> that is a good hit, Socrates;  evidently you havenÕt forgotten your mathematics, and you are quite right in, finding fault with my bad arithmetic.  I will get even with you at some other time;  but now, Stranger, I turn to you.  Do not grow tired of being kind to us, but go on and tell us about the statesman or the philosopher,

<milestone n="257c" unit="section"/>whichever you prefer to take first.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>That is the thing to do, Theodorus, since we have once begun, and we must not stop until we have finished with them.  But what shall I do about Theaetetus here?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theodorus</speaker><p>In what respect?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Shall we give him a rest and take his schoolmate here, the young Socrates, in his place?  What is your advice?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theodorus</speaker><p>Make the change as you suggest.  They are young, and if they have a chance to rest by turns, they will bear any labor better.
<milestone n="257d" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And besides, Stranger, it seems to me that they are both related to me after a fashion;  one of them anyhow, as you say, looks like me in his cast of countenance, and the other has the same name and appellation, which implies some sort of kinship.
<milestone unit="page" n="258"/><milestone n="258a" unit="section"/>Of course we ought always to be eager to get acquainted with our relatives by debating with them.  Now I myself had an argument with Theaetetus yesterday and have been listening to his answers just now, but I do not know Socrates in either way and must examine him, too.  But let him reply to you now;  my turn will come by and by.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Very well;  Socrates, do you hear what Socrates says?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And do you agree?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Certainly.
<milestone n="258b" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>There seems to be no objection on your part, and I suppose there should be still less on mine.  Well, then, after the sophist, I think it is our next duty to seek for the statesman;  so please tell me:  should we rank him also among those who have a science, or not?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Must the sciences, then, be divided as when we were examining the sophist?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Perhaps.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>In that case, Socrates, I think the division will not be along the same lines.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>How will it be?
<milestone n="258c" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Along other lines.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Very likely.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Where, then, shall we find the statesmanÕs path?  For we must find it, separate it from the rest, and imprint upon it the seal of a single class;  then we must set the mark of another single class upon all the other paths that lead away from this, and make our soul conceive of all sciences as of two classes.<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">i.e. one class is to be separated and then all the rest are to be marked as one other class&mdash;the familiar division into two parts.</note></p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>This, Stranger, is now your affair, I think, not mine.
<milestone n="258d" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And yet, Socrates, it must be your affair, too, when we have found the path.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Quite true.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Are not arithmetic and certain other kindred arts pure sciences, without regard to practical application, which merely furnish knowledge?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Yes, they are.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>But the science possessed by the arts relating to carpentering and to handicraft in general is inherent in their application,
<milestone n="258e" unit="section"/>and with its aid they create objects which did not previously exist.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>To be sure.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>In this way, then, divide all science into two arts, calling the one practical, and the other purely intellectual.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Let us assume that all science is one and that these are its two forms.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Shall we then assume that the statesman, king, master, and householder too, for that matter, are all one, to be grouped under one title, or shall we say that there are as many arts as names?  But let me rather help you to understand in this way.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>In what way?
<milestone unit="page" n="259"/><milestone n="259a" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>By this example:  If anyone, though himself in private station, is able to advise one of the public physicians, must not his art be called by the same name as that of the man whom he advises?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Well, then, if a man who is himself in private station is wise enough to advise him who is king of a country, shall we not say that he has the science which the ruler himself ought to possess?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>We shall.
<milestone n="259b" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>But certainly the science of a true king is kingly science?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And will not he who possesses this science, whether he happen to be a ruler or a private citizen, rightly be called &ldquo;kingly,&rdquo; when considered purely with reference to his art?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>At least he has a right to be.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And surely the householder and the master of a family are the same.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Yes, of course.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Well, so far as government is concerned, is there any difference between the grandeur of a large house and the majesty of a small state?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>No.
<milestone n="259c" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Then as for the point we were just discussing, it is clear that all these are the objects of one science, and whether a man calls this the art of kingship or statesmanship or householding, let us not quarrel with him.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>By no means.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>But this is plain, that any king can do little with his hands or his whole body toward holding his position, compared with what he can do with the sagacity and strength of his soul.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Yes, that is plain.
<milestone n="259d" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Shall we say, then, that the king is more akin to the intellectual than to the manual or the practical in general?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Shall we, therefore, put all these together as one&mdash;the political art and the statesman, the royal art and the king?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Obviously.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Then we should be proceeding in due order if we should next divide intellectual science?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Now pay attention to see if we can perceive any natural line of cleavage in it.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Tell us of what sort it is.
<milestone n="259e" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Of this sort.  We recognized a sort of art of calculation.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>It is, I suppose, most certainly one of the intellectual arts.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Of course.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And shall we grant to the art of calculation, when it has found out the difference between numbers, any further function than that of passing judgement on them when found out?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>No, certainly not.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Every architect, too, is a ruler of workmen, not a workman himself.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>As supplying knowledge, not manual labor.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>True.
<milestone unit="page" n="260"/><milestone n="260a" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>So he may fairly be said to participate in intellectual science.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>But it is his business, I suppose, not to pass judgement and be done with it and go away, as the calculator did, but to give each of the workmen the proper orders, until they have finished their appointed task.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>You are right.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Then all such sciences, and all those that are in the class with calculating, are alike intellectual sciences,
<milestone n="260b" unit="section"/>but these two classes differ from one another in the matter of judging and commanding.  Am I right?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>I think so.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Then if we bisected intellectual science as a whole and called one part the commanding and the other the judging part, might we say we had made fitting division?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Yes, in my opinion.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And surely when men are doing anything in common it is pleasant for them to agree.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Of course it is.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>On this point, then, so long as we ourselves are in agreement, we need not bother about the opinions of others.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Of course not.
<milestone n="260c" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Now to which of these two classes is the kingly man to be assigned?  Shall we assign him to the art of judging, as a kind of spectator, or rather to the art of commanding, inasmuch as he is a ruler?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Rather to the latter, of course.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Then once more we must see whether the art of command falls into two divisions.  It seems to me that it does, and I think there is much the same distinction between the kingly class and the class of heralds
<milestone n="260d" unit="section"/>as between the art of men who sell what they themselves produce and that of retail dealers.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>How so?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Retail dealers receive and sell over again the productions of others, which have generally been sold before.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And in like manner heralds receive the purposes of others in the form of orders, and then give the orders a second time to others.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Very true.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Shall we, then, join the art of the king in the same class with the art of the interpreter,
<milestone n="260e" unit="section"/>the boatswain, the prophet, the herald, and many other kindred arts, all of which involve giving orders?  Or, as we just now made a comparison of functions, shall we now by comparison make a name also&mdash;since the class of those who issue orders of their own is virtually nameless&mdash;and assign kings to the science of giving orders of oneÕs own, disregarding all the rest and leaving to someone else the task of naming them?  For the object of our present quest is the ruler,

<milestone unit="page" n="261"/><milestone n="261a" unit="section"/>not his opposite.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Quite right.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Then since a reasonable distinction between this class and the rest has been made, by distinguishing the commands given as oneÕs own or anotherÕs, shall we again divide this class, if there is in it any further line of section?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>I think there is one;  please help me in making the section.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>On what line?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Take the case of all those whom we conceive of as rulers who give commands:  shall we not find that they all issue commands
<milestone n="261b" unit="section"/>for the sake of producing something?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Of course.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Furthermore it is not at all difficult to divide all that is produced into two classes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>How?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Of the whole class, some have life and others have no life.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And on these same lines we may, if we like, make a division of the part of intellectual science which commands.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>In what way?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>By assigning one part of it to the production of lifeless, the other to that of living objects;
<milestone n="261c" unit="section"/>and in this way the whole will be divided into two parts.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Let us then leave one half and take up the other, and then let us divide that entire half into two parts.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Which half shall we take up?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>That which issues commands relating to living objects, assuredly.  For certainly the science of the king is not, like that of the architect, one which supervises lifeless objects;  it is a nobler science,
<milestone n="261d" unit="section"/>since it exercises its power among living beings and in relation to them alone.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>True.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Now you may notice that the breeding and nurture of living beings is sometimes the nurture of a single animal and sometimes the common care of creatures in droves.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>True.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>But we shall find that the statesman is not one who tends a single creature, like the driver of a single ox or the groom who tends a horse;  he has more resemblance to a man who tends a herd of cattle or a drove of horses.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>That seems to be true, now that you mention it.
<milestone n="261e" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Shall we call the art of caring for many living creatures the art of tending a herd or something like community management?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Whichever we happen to say.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Good, Socrates!  If you preserve this attitude of indifference to mere names, you will turn out richer in wisdom when you are old.  But now we will, as you suggest, not trouble ourselves about the name;  but do you see a way in which a man may show that the art of herding is twofold,
<milestone unit="page" n="262"/><milestone n="262a" unit="section"/>and may thereby cause that which is now sought among a double number of things to be sought among half as many?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>I am quite willing to try.  I think one kind is the care of men, the other that of beasts.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>You made the division with perfect willingness and courage.  However, let us do our best not to fall again into your error.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>What error?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>We must not take a single small part, and set it off against many large ones, nor disregard species in making our division.
<milestone n="262b" unit="section"/>On the contrary, the part must be also a species.  It is a very fine thing to separate the object of our search at once from everything else, if the separation can be made correctly, and so, just now, you thought you had the right division and you hurried our discussion along, because you saw that it was leading towards man.  But, my friend, it is not safe to whittle off shavings;  it is safer to proceed by cutting through the middle, and in that way one is more likely to find classes.
<milestone n="262c" unit="section"/>This makes all the difference in the conduct of research.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>What do you mean by that, Stranger?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>I must try to speak still more clearly, Socrates, out of regard for your capacity.  Just at present it is impossible to make the matter entirely plain, but I will try to lay it before you a little more fully for the sake of clearness.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>What is it, then, that you say we did wrongly in making our division just now?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>It was very much as if, in undertaking to divide the human race into two parts,
<milestone n="262d" unit="section"/>one should make the division as most people in this country do;  they separate the Hellenic race from all the rest as one, and to all the other races, which are countless in number and have no relation in blood or language to one another, they give the single name &ldquo;barbarian&rdquo;;  then, because of this single name, they think it is a single species.  Or it was as if a man should think he was dividing number into two classes by cutting off a myriad from all the other numbers, with the notion that he was making one separate class,
<milestone n="262e" unit="section"/>and then should give one name to all the rest, and because of that name should think that this also formed one class distinct from the other.  A better division, more truly classified and more equal, would be made by dividing number into odd and even, and the human race into male and female;  as for the Lydians and Phrygians and various others they could be opposed to the rest and split off from them when it was impossible to find and separate two parts,
<milestone unit="page" n="263"/><milestone n="263a" unit="section"/>each of which formed a class.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Very true;  but thatÕs just the trouble, Stranger:  how can we get a clearer knowledge of class and part, and see that they are not the same thing, but different?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Socrates, you most excellent young man, it is no small task you impose upon me.  We have already strayed away from our subject more than we ought, and you wish us to wander still farther afield.  So for the present let us return to our subject, as is proper;  then we will go on the trail of this other matter by and by, when we have time.
<milestone n="263b" unit="section"/>Only take very good care not to imagine that you ever heard me declare flatly&mdash;</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>What?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>That class and part are separate from one another.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>But what did you say?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>That when there is a class of anything, it must necessarily be a part of the thing of which it is said to be a class;  but there is no necessity that a part be also a class.  Please always give this, rather than the other, as my doctrine.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>I will do so.
<milestone n="263c" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Then please go on to the next point.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>What is it?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>That from which our present digression started.  For I think it started when you were asked how the art of herding should be divided and said with great readiness that there were two kinds of living beings, the human race and a second one, a single class, comprising all the beasts.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>True.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And it was clear to me at the time that you removed a part and then thought that the remainder was one class
<milestone n="263d" unit="section"/>because you were able to call them all by the same name of beasts.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>That is true, too.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>But indeed, my most courageous young friend, perhaps, if there is any other animal capable of thought, such as the crane appears to be, or any other like creature, and it perchance gives names, just as you do, it might in its pride of self oppose cranes to all other animals, and group the rest, men included, under one head, calling them by one name, which might very well be that of beasts.  Now let us try to be on our guard against all that sort of thing.
<milestone n="263e" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>How can we guard against it?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>By not dividing the whole class of living beings, that so we may avoid such errors.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Well, there is no need of dividing the whole.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>No, certainly not, for it was in that way that we fell into our former error.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>What do you mean?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>That part of intellectual science which involves giving commands was a part of our animal-tending class, with especial reference to animals in herds, was it not?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Well, even at that stage of our discussion all animals had already been divided into tame and wild.
<milestone unit="page" n="264"/><milestone n="264a" unit="section"/>For if their nature admits of domestication they are called tame; if it does not, they are called wild.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Excellent.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>But the science we are hunting for was, and is, to be sought among tame creatures, more specifically creatures in herds.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Let us, then, not make our division as we did before, with a view to all, nor in a hurry, with the idea that we may thus reach political science quickly,
<milestone n="264b" unit="section"/>for that has already brought upon us the proverbial penalty.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>What penalty?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>The penalty of having made less speed, because we made too much haste and did not make our division right.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>And it was a good thing for us, Stranger</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>I do not deny it.  So let us begin again and try to divide the art of tending animals in common;  for perhaps the information you desire so much will come to you in the ordinary course of our conversation better than by other means.  Tell me&mdash;</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>What?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Whether, as I suppose, you have often heard people speak of this,&mdash;
<milestone n="264c" unit="section"/>for I know you never actually saw the preserves of fish in the <placeName key="tgn,1127805">Nile</placeName> and in the ponds of the Persian king.  But perhaps you have noticed the like in fountain-pools.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Yes, I have often seen the fish in fountain-pools and have heard many tales of those foreign preserves.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And surely, even if you have not wandered over the plains of <placeName key="tgn,7001399">Thessaly</placeName>, you have heard of goose-farms and crane-farms there and you believe that they exist.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Yes, of course.
<milestone n="264d" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>The reason why I asked you all these questions is that the rearing of flocks is in part aquatic and in part an affair of the dry land.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Yes, that is true.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Then do you agree that we ought to divide the art of tending animals in common into corresponding parts, assigning one part of it to each of these two, and calling one the art of aquatic-herding and the other the art of land-herding?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Yes, I agree.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And surely we shall not have to ask
<milestone n="264e" unit="section"/>to which of these two arts kingship belongs, for that is clear to everyone.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Of course.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Anybody could doubtless make a division of the art of tending herds on land.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>What would the division be?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Into the tending of flying and walking animals.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Very true.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And statesmanship is to be sought in connection with walking animals, is it not?  Any fool, so to speak, would believe that, donÕt you think?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Of course.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And the art of tending animals that walk must, like an even number, be divided in half.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Evidently.
<milestone unit="page" n="265"/><milestone n="265a" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And now I think I see two paths leading in that direction in which our argument has started:  the quicker way, by separating a relatively small part and a larger, and the other way, which is more   in accord with what we said a while ago about the need of making the division as nearly in the middle as we can, but is longer.  So we can proceed by whichever of the two we wish.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Can we not go by both?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Not by both at once, silly boy;  but obviously we can take them in turn.
<milestone n="265b" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Then I choose both in turn.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>That is easy enough, since we have but a short distance to go.  At the beginning, certainly, or middle of our journey it would have been hard to comply with your demand.  But now, since this is your wish, let us go first by the longer way, for we are fresher now and shall get along on it more easily.  So attend to the division.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Go on.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>The tame walking animals which live in herds are divided by nature into two classes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>How by nature?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Because one class is naturally without horns, and the other has horns.
<milestone n="265c" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>That is obvious.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Now divide the art of tending herds of walking animals into two parts, assigning one to each class of animals;  and define the parts, for if you try to give them names, the matter will become needlessly complicated.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>How shall I speak of them then?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>In this way:  say that the science which tends herds of walking animals is divided into two parts, one of which is assigned to the horned portion of the herd, the other to the hornless portion.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Assume that I have said that;
<milestone n="265d" unit="section"/>for you have made it perfectly clear.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And furthermore our &ldquo;king&rdquo; is very clearly the herdsman of a herd devoid of horns.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Of course;  that is evident.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Let us then try to break up this herd and give the king the part that belongs to him.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Very well.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Shall we make our division on the basis of having or not having cloven hoofs, or on that of mixing or not mixing the breed?  You know what I mean.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>No.  What is it?
<milestone n="265e" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Why, I mean that horses and asses can breed from each other.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Oh yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>But the rest of the herd of hornless tame animals cannot cross the breed.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>That is true, of course.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Well then, does the statesman appear to have charge of a kind that mixes or of one that does not mix the breed?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Evidently of one that is unmixed.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>So I suppose we must proceed as we have done heretofore and divide this into two parts.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Yes, we must.
<milestone unit="page" n="266"/><milestone n="266a" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And yet tame gregarious animals have all, with the exception of about two species, been already divided;  for dogs are not properly to be counted among gregarious creatures.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>No, they are not.  But how shall we divide the two species?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>As you and Theaetetus ought by rights to divide them, since you are interested in geometry.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>How do you mean?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>By the diameter, of course, and again by the diameter of the square of the diameter.<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">The word &ldquo;diameter&rdquo; here denotes the diagonal of a square.  The early Greek mathematicians worked out their arithmetical problems largely by geometrical methods (cf. <bibl n="Plat. Theaet. 147 d">Plat. Theaet. 147 D ff</bibl>).  The diagonal of the unit square (&radic;2) was naturally of especial interest.  It was called sometimes, as here simply <foreign lang="greek">H( DIA/METROS</foreign>, sometimes, as just below,<foreign lang="greek">H( DIA/METROS H( DUNA/MEI DI/POUS</foreign>, or, more briefly,<foreign lang="greek">H( DIA/METROS DI/POUS</foreign>.  Given a square the side of which is the unit (i.e. one square foot), the length of the diagonal will be &radic;2 and the square constructed with that diagonal as its side will contain two square feet.  The length of the diagonal of this square will be &radic;4=2 feet, and its area will be four square feet.</note></p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>What do you mean by that?
<milestone n="266b" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Is the nature which our human race possesses related to walking in any other way than as the diameter which is the square root of two feet?<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">There is here a play upon words.  Man, being a two-footed (<foreign lang="greek">DI/POUS</foreign>) animal, is compared to the diagonal of the unit square (&radic;2,<foreign lang="greek">DIA/METROS DI/POUS</foreign>).</note></p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>No.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And the nature of the remaining species, again, considered from the point of view of the square root, is the diameter of the square of our root, if it is the nature of twice two feet.<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">i.e. the remaining species is four-footed.  Our diameter is &radic;2, and four is the area of the square constructed on the diagonal of the square which has &radic;2 as its side.  All this satirizes the tendency of contemporary thinkers to play with numbers.</note></p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Of course;  and now I think I almost understand what you wish to make plain.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Socrates, do we see that besides this something else has turned up
<milestone n="266c" unit="section"/>in these divisions of ours which would be a famous joke?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>No. What is it?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Our human race shares the same lot and runs in the same heat as the most excellent and at the same time most easy-going race of creatures.<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">The animal referred to is the pig.  See P. Shorey, <title>Classical Philology,</title>1917, July, p. 308.</note></p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Yes, I see that;  it is a very queer result.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Indeed?  But is it not reasonable that they arrive last, who are the slowest?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Yes, that is true.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And do we fail to notice this further point, that the king appears in a still more ridiculous light, running along with the herd and paired in the race with the man of all others
<milestone n="266d" unit="section"/>who is most in training for a life of careless ease?<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">i.e. the swineherd, the pig belonging to <foreign lang="greek">GE/NEI EU)XERESTA/TW|</foreign>.</note></p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Certainly he does.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>For now, Socrates, we have shown more clearly the truth of that which we said yesterday in our search for the sophist.<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">See <bibl n="Plat. Soph. 227B">Plat. Soph. 227B</bibl>.</note></p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>What was it?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>That this method of argument pays no more heed to the noble than to the ignoble, and no less honor to the small than to the great, but always goes on its own way to the most perfect truth.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>So it seems.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Then shall I now, without waiting for you to ask me, guide you of my own accord along that shorter way referred to a moment ago that leads
<milestone n="266e" unit="section"/>to the definition of the king?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>By all means.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>I say, then, that we ought at that time to have divided walking animals immediately into biped and quadruped, then seeing that the human race falls into the same division with the feathered creatures and no others, we must again divide the biped class into featherless and feathered, and when that division is made and the art of herding human beings is made plain, we ought to take the statesmanlike and kingly man and place him as a sort of charioteer therein, handing over to him the reins of the state, because that is his own proper science.
<milestone unit="page" n="267"/><milestone n="267a" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>You have cleared up the argument finely, and as if it were a debt you were paying, you threw in the digression as interest and for good measure.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Now let us go back to the beginning and join together the definition of the name of the statesmanÕs art link by link to the end.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>By all means.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>In the first place we said that intellectual science had a part that gives commands;  and a portion of this was called by a comparison the part that gives its own commands;
<milestone n="267b" unit="section"/>and again the art of rearing living beings was singled out, which is by no means the smallest part of the art which gives its own commands;  and a class of rearing living beings was herd-tending, and a part of this again the herding of walking animals;  and from the herding of walking animals the art of rearing those without horns was divided.  And of this in turn one part will have to be treated as no less than threefold, if it is to be called by one comprehensive name, and it will be called (1) the science (2) of tending herds (3) which do not cross breeds.
<milestone n="267c" unit="section"/>But the only possible further subdivision of this is the art of herding human beings, and this is at last what we are looking for, the single art called both kingly and statesmanlike.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>That is perfectly true.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And yet, Socrates, have we truly accomplished this, exactly as you have said?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Accomplished what?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>The perfectly satisfactory discussion of our subject.  Or is our investigation incomplete in just this detail, that we have given a definition after a fashion,
<milestone n="267d" unit="section"/>but have not perfectly completed it?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>What do you mean?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>I will try to make still plainer to us both the thought which I now have in mind.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Please do so.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>We found just now that there were many arts of herding, and one of them was the art of statesmanship, which was the care of one particular kind of herd, did we not?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And our argument defined this, not as the tending of horses or other beasts, but as the science of tending men in common.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Yes, it did.
<milestone n="267e" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Let us, then, observe the point of difference between kings and all other herdsmen.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>What point of difference?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Let us see whether anyone who is designated by the name of another art says and claims that he is fellow manager of the herd in common with any of the other kinds of herdsmen.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>What do you mean?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>For instance, merchants, husbandmen, and all who prepare grain for use, and also gymnastic trainers and physicians would certainly all dispute with the herdsmen of humanity, whom we have called statesmen,
<milestone unit="page" n="268"/><milestone n="268a" unit="section"/>and would assert that they themselves take care of the tending of humanity, and not the tending of the common herd only, but even that of the rulers themselves, would they not?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>And would they be right?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Perhaps.  We will examine that matter;  but this we know, that no one will ever raise such a contention against any neatherd, but the herdsman himself tends the herd, he is their physician, he is their matchmaker,
<milestone n="268b" unit="section"/>and he alone knows the midwifeÕs science of aiding at the birth of their offspring.  Moreover, so far as the nature of the creatures allows them to enjoy sport or music, no one can enliven or soothe them better than he;  whether with instruments or merely with his voice he performs the music best suited to his own herd;  and the same applies to the other herdsmen.  Is not that the case?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>You are quite right.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Then how can our discourse about the king be right and free from error,
<milestone n="268c" unit="section"/>when we pick him out alone as herdsman and tender of the human herd, while countless others dispute his claim?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>It cannot possibly be right.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>We suspected a little while ago that although we might be outlining a sort of kingly shape we had not yet perfected an accurate portrait of the statesman, and could not do so until, by removing those who crowd about him and contend with him for a share in his herdsmanship, we separated him from them and made him stand forth alone and uncontaminated.  Was our fear justified?
<milestone n="268d" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>It certainly was.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Then we must attend to that, Socrates, if we are not to end our argument in disgrace.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>But we certainly must not do that.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Then we must begin again from a new sarting-point and travel by a different road.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>By what road?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>By one which offers us some amusement;  for there is a famous story a great part of which it is really our duty to insert into our discussion;  and then after that we can proceed as before,
<milestone n="268e" unit="section"/>by eliminating part after part, and in that way reach the ultimate object of our search.  Shall we do that?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>By all means.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Then please pay careful attention to my story, just as if you were a child;  and anyway you are not much too old for childrenÕs tales.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Please tell the story.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Of the portents recorded in ancient tales many did happen and will happen again.  Such an one is the portent connected with the tale of the quarrel between Atreus and Thyestes.  You have doubtless heard of it and remember what is said to have taken place.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>You refer, I suppose, to the token of the golden lamb.<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">Hermes revenged upon the Pelopidae the death of his son Myrtilus by causing a lamb with golden fleece to be born among the flocks of Atreus.  When his claim to the succession was disputed, Atreus promised to show this prodigy to prove that the gods were on his side.  Thyestes persuaded Aerope, the wife of Atreus, to give him the lamb, and Atreus was in danger of losing his kingdom, had not Zeus, who favored his claim, made the sun and the Pleiades return from their setting towards their rising.  This is the form of the story given in a scholium on <bibl n="Eur. Orest. 988">Eur. Orest. 988</bibl>, and Plato seems to have this form in mind, though variants existed.  The lamb was a token (<foreign lang="greek">SHMEI=ON</foreign>) of the favor of the gods, and the changed course of the sun and stars was a testimony (<foreign lang="greek">MARTURH/SAS</foreign>) to the right of Atreus.</note>
<milestone unit="page" n="269"/><milestone n="269a" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Oh no;  I mean the change in the rising and setting of the sun and the other heavenly bodies, how in those times they used to set in the quarter where they now rise, and used to rise where they now set, but the god at the time of the quarrel, you recall, changed all that to the present system as a testimony in favor of Atreus.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Yes, IÕve heard that, too.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And again we have often heard the tale of the reign of Cronus.
<milestone n="269b" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Yes, very often.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And how about the story that the ancient folk were earthborn and not begotten of one another?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>That is one of the old tales, too.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Well, all these stories and others still more remarkable have their source in one and the same event, but in the lapse of ages some of them have been lost and others are told in fragmentary and disconnected fashion.  But no one has told the event which is the cause of them all,
<milestone n="269c" unit="section"/>and so I must tell it now;  for that will help us to make clear the nature of the king.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Very good;  just tell your tale and omit nothing.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Listen then.  During a certain period God himself goes with the universe as guide in its revolving course, but at another epoch, when the cycles have at length reached the measure of his allotted time, he lets it go,
<milestone n="269d" unit="section"/>and of its own accord it turns backward in the opposite direction, since it is a living creature and is endowed with intelligence by him who fashioned it in the beginning.  Now this reversal of its motion is an inevitable part of its nature for the following reason.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>What reason?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Absolute and perpetual immutability is a property of only the most divine things of all, and body does not belong to this class.  Now that which we call heaven and the universe has received from its creator many blessed qualities, but then, too, it partakes also of a bodily nature;
<milestone n="269e" unit="section"/>therefore it is impossible for it to be entirely free from change;  it moves, however, so far as it is able to do so, with a single motion in the same place and the same manner, and therefore it has acquired the reverse motion in a circle, because that involves the least deviation from its own motion.  But to turn itself for ever is hardly possible except for the power that guides all moving things;  and that this should turn now in one direction and now in the opposite direction is contrary to divine law.  As the result of all this, we must not say either that the universe turns itself always, or that it is always turned by God in two opposite courses,
<milestone unit="page" n="270"/><milestone n="270a" unit="section"/>or again that two divinities opposed to one another turn it.  The only remaining alternative is what I suggested a little while ago, that the universe is guided at one time by an extrinsic divine cause, acquiring the power of living again and receiving renewed immortality from the Creator, and at another time it is left to itself and then moves by its own motion, being left to itself at such a moment that it moves backwards through countless ages, because it is immensely large and most evenly balanced, and turns upon the smallest pivot.
<milestone n="270b" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>All that account of yours appears, at any rate, very reasonable.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Then, in the light of what has been said, let us consider and gain understanding of the event which we said was the cause of all those wonderful portents;  for it is really just this.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Just what?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>The fact that at certain periods the universe has its present circular motion, and at other periods it revolves in the reverse direction.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>How was this the cause?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>We cannot help believing that of all the changes which take place in the heavens this reversal is
<milestone n="270c" unit="section"/>the greatest and most complete.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>It certainly seems to be so.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Therefore we must also believe that at the same time the greatest changes come upon us who dwell within the heavens.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>That is likely too.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And animals cannot well endure many great and various changes at once.  That is a familiar fact, is it not?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Of course.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Inevitably, then, there is at that time great destruction of animals in general, and only a small part of the human race survives;
<milestone n="270d" unit="section"/>and the survivors have many experiences wonderful and strange, the greatest of which, a consequence of the reversal of everything at the time when the world begins to turn in the direction opposed to that of its present revolution, is this.<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">The tale of Atreus introduces the fanciful theory of the reversal of the revolution of the heavenly bodies, and this, especially in an age when the stars were believed to exercise a direct influence upon mankind and other creatures, naturally brings with it the reversal of all processes of growth.  This leads to a new birth of mankind, and the Stranger then briefly describes the age of innocence, the fall of man and the barbarism that follows, and the partial restoration of man through divine interposition and the gift of the various arts of civilization.  Plato does not offer this as a real explanation of the existing condition of the world, but it serves, like the myths introduced in other dialogues to present, in connection with accepted mythology, a theory which may account for some of the facts of life.</note></p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>What is that experience?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>First the age of all animals, whatever it was at the moment, stood still, and every mortal creature stopped growing older in appearance
<milestone n="270e" unit="section"/>and then reversed its growth and became, as it were, younger and more tender;  the hoary locks of the old men grew dark, and bearded cheeks grew smooth again as their possessors reverted to their earlier ages, and the bodies of young men grew smoother and smaller day by day and night by night, until they became as new-born babes, to which they were likened in mind and body;  and then at last they wasted away entirely and wholly disappeared.  And the bodies of those who died by violence in those times quickly underwent the same changes,
<milestone unit="page" n="271"/><milestone n="271a" unit="section"/>were destroyed, and disappeared in a few days.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>But then, Stranger, how did animals come into existence in those days?  How were they begotten of one another?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>It is clear, Socrates, that being begotten of one another was no part of the natural order of that time, but the earth-born race which, according to tradition, once existed, was the race which returned at that time out of the earth;  and the memory of it was preserved by our earliest ancestors, who were born in the beginning of our period and therefore were next neighbors to the end of the previous period of the worldÕs revolution,

<milestone n="271b" unit="section"/>with no interval between.  For they were to us the heralds of these stories which are nowadays unduly disbelieved by many people.  For you must, I think, consider what would result.  It is a natural consequence of the return of the old to childhood that those who are dead and lying in the earth take shape and come to life again, since the process of birth is reversed along with the reversal of the worldÕs revolution;  for this reason they are inevitably earth-born,

<milestone n="271c" unit="section"/>and hence arises their name and the tradition about them, except those of them whom God removed to some other fate.<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">This may refer to philosophers (cf. <bibl n="Plat. Phaedo 82c">Plat. Phaedo 82c</bibl>) or, more probably, to those who, like Menelaus, were transferred to the abode of the blessed, or, like Heracles, became gods.  Such individuals would be exempt from the consequences of any subsequent reversal of the WorldÕs revolution.</note></p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Certainly that follows from what preceded.  But was the life in the reign of Cronus, which you mentioned, in that previous period of revolution or in ours?  For evidently the change in the course of the stars and the sun takes place in both periods.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>You have followed my account very well.
<milestone n="271d" unit="section"/>No, the life about which you ask, when all the fruits of the earth sprang up of their own accord for men, did not belong at all to the present period of revolution, but this also belonged to the previous one.  For then, in the beginning, God ruled and supervised the whole revolution, and so again, in the same way, all the parts of the universe were divided by regions among gods who ruled them, and, moreover, the animals were distributed by species and flocks among inferior deities as divine shepherds, each of whom was in all respects the independent guardian of the creatures under his own care,
<milestone n="271e" unit="section"/>so that no creature was wild, nor did they eat one another, and there was no war among them, nor any strife whatsoever.  To tell all the other consequences of such an order of the world would be an endless task.  But the reason for the story of the spontaneous life of mankind is as follows:  God himself was their shepherd, watching over them, just as man, being an animal of different and more divine nature than the rest, now tends the lower species of animals.  And under his care there were no states,
<milestone unit="page" n="272"/><milestone n="272a" unit="section"/>nor did men possess wives or children;  for they all came to life again out of the earth, with no recollection of their former lives.  So there were no states or families, but they had fruits in plenty from the trees and other plants, which the earth furnished them of its own accord, without help from agriculture.  And they lived for the most part in the open air, without clothing or bedding;  for the climate was tempered for their comfort, and the abundant grass that grew up out of the earth furnished them soft couches.
<milestone n="272b" unit="section"/>That, Socrates, was the life of men in the reign of Cronus;  but the life of the present age, which is said to be the age of Zeus, you know by your own experience.  Would you be able and willing to decide which of them is the more blessed?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Certainly not.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Shall I, then, make some sort of a judgement for you?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Do so, by all means.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Well, then, if the foster children of Cronus, having all this leisure and the ability to converse not only with human beings but also with beasts,
<milestone n="272c" unit="section"/>made full use of all these opportunities with a view to philosophy, talking with the animals and with one another and learning from every creature that, through possession of some peculiar power he may have had in any respect beyond his fellows perceptions tending towards an increase of wisdom, it would be easy to decide that the people of those old times were immeasurably happier than those of our epoch.  Or if they merely ate and drank till they were full and gossiped with each other and the animals, telling such stories as are even now told about them,
<milestone n="272d" unit="section"/>in that case, too, it would, in my opinion, be very easy to reach a decision.  However, let us pass those matters by, so long as there is no one capable of reporting to us what the desires of the people in those days were in regard to knowledge and the employment of speech.  The reason why we revived this legend must be told, in order that we may get ahead afterwards.  For when the time of all those conditions was accomplished and the change was to take place and all the earth-born race had at length been used up,
<milestone n="272e" unit="section"/>since every soul had fulfilled all its births by falling into the earth as seed its prescribed number of times, then the helmsman of the universe dropped the tiller and withdrew to his place of outlook, and fate and innate desire made the earth turn backwards.  So, too, all the gods who share, each in his own sphere, the rule of the Supreme Spirit, promptly perceiving what was taking place, let go the parts of the world which were under their care.
<milestone unit="page" n="273"/><milestone n="273a" unit="section"/>And as the universe was turned back and there came the shock of collision, as the beginning and the end rushed in opposite directions, it produced a great earthquake within itself and caused a new destruction of all sorts of living creatures.  But after that, when a sufficient time had elapsed, there was rest now from disturbance and confusion, calm followed the earthquakes, and the world went on its own accustomed course in orderly fashion, exercising care and rule
<milestone n="273b" unit="section"/>over itself and all within itself, and remembering and practising the teachings of the Creator and Father to the extent of its power, at first more accurately and at last more carelessly;  and the reason for this was the material element in its composition, because this element, which was inherent in the primeval nature, was infected with great disorder before the attainment of the existing orderly universe.  For from its Composer the universe has received only good things;  but from its previous condition it retains in itself and creates in the animals all the elements of harshness and injustice
<milestone n="273c" unit="section"/>which have their origin in the heavens.  Now as long as the world was nurturing the animals within itself under the guidance of the Pilot, it produced little evil and great good;  but in becoming separated from him it always got on most excellently during the time immediately after it was let go, but as time went on and it grew forgetful, the ancient condition of disorder prevailed more and more
<milestone n="273d" unit="section"/>and towards the end of the time reached its height, and the universe, mingling but little good with much of the opposite sort, was in danger of destruction for itself and those within it.  Therefore at that moment God, who made the order of the universe, perceived that it was in dire trouble, and fearing that it might founder in the tempest of confusion and sink in the boundless sea of diversity,
<milestone n="273e" unit="section"/>he took again his place as its helmsman, reversed whatever had become unsound and unsettled in the previous period when the world was left to itself, set the world in order, restored it and made it immortal and ageless.  So now the whole tale is told;  but for our purpose of exhibiting the nature of the king it will be enough to revert to the earlier part of the story.  For when the universe was turned again into the present path of generation, the age of individuals came again to a stop, and that led to new processes, the reverse of those which had gone before.  For the animals which had grown so small as almost to disappear grew larger, and those newly born from the earth with hoary hair died and passed below the earth again.  And all other things changed,
<milestone unit="page" n="274"/><milestone n="274a" unit="section"/>imitating the condition of the universe and conforming to it, and so too pregnancy and birth and nurture necessarily imitated and conformed to the rest;  for no living creature could any longer come into being by the union of other elements, but just as the universe was ordered to be the ruler of its own course, so in the same way the parts were ordered, so far as they could, to grow and beget and give nourishment of themselves under the same guidance.
<milestone n="274b" unit="section"/>And now we have come at last to the point for the sake of which this whole discourse was begun.  For much might be said, and at great length, about the other animals, their previous forms and the causes of their several changes;  but about mankind there is less to say and it is more to our purpose.  For men, deprived of the care of the deity who had possessed and tended us, since most of the beasts who were by nature unfriendly had grown fierce, and they themselves were feeble and unprotected, were ravaged by the beasts
<milestone n="274c" unit="section"/>and were in the first ages still without resources or skill;  the food which had formerly offered itself freely had failed them, and they did not yet know how to provide for themselves, because no necessity had hitherto compelled them.  On all these accounts they were in great straits;  and that is the reason why the gifts of the gods that are told of in the old traditions were given us with the needful information and instruction,&mdash;fire by Prometheus, the arts by Hephaestus and the goddess who is his fellow-artisan, seeds and plants by other deities.<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">The fellow-artisan of Hephaestus is Athena;  seeds and plants are the gifts of Demeter and Dionysus.</note>
<milestone n="274d" unit="section"/>And from these has arisen all that constitutes human life, since, as I said a moment ago, the care of the gods had failed men and they had to direct their own lives and take care of themselves, like the whole universe, which we imitate and follow through all time, being born and living now in our present manner and in that other epoch in the other manner.
<milestone n="274e" unit="section"/>So, then, let our tale be finished;  but we will turn it to account for opening our eyes to the great error we made in the exposition of the king and the statesman in our earlier discussion.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>How, then, did we err, and what is the great error you say we have committed?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>In one way we made a comparatively slight error, in another a very important one, much greater and more far-reaching than the first.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>How did we do that?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>When we were asked about the king and the statesman of the present movement of the world and mode of generation, we told of the shepherd of the human flock in the time of the reverse movement,
<milestone unit="page" n="275"/><milestone n="275a" unit="section"/>and he was a god, not a man, besides.  That was a very great error.  Then when we declared that he was ruler of the whole state, but did not fully tell in what manner he ruled, what we said was true, though it was not complete nor clear, and therefore our error was less in this case than in the other.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>True.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Apparently, then, we must expect a complete description of the statesman only when we have defined the manner of his rule over the state.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Very good.
<milestone n="275b" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And this is why I introduced the myth, not only in order to show that all men compete for the care of the flock with him whom we are now seeking, but also that we may more clearly see him who alone ought to have the care of human beings as shepherds and neatherds care for their flocks and herds, and therefore alone deserves to be honored with that appellation.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Quite right.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>I think, Socrates, that the form of the divine shepherd is greater
<milestone n="275c" unit="section"/>than that of the king, whereas the statesmen who now exist here are by nature much more like their subjects, with whom they share much more nearly the same breeding and education.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And yet they would have to be investigated with precisely the same care, whether their nature be like that of their subjects or like that of the divine shepherd.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Of course.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Then let us go back to this point:  the art which we said gave its own orders and had to do with living beings,
<milestone n="275d" unit="section"/>but had charge of them not singly but in common, and which we at once called the art of the herdsman,&mdash;do you remember?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Well, it was in connection with that, somewhere, that we made our mistake;  for we never included or named the statesman;  unobserved by us he slipped out of our nomenclature.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>How so?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>All the other herdsmen have this in common that they feed their respective herds;  but the statesman does not, yet we gave him the name of herdsman, when we ought to have given him one
<milestone n="275e" unit="section"/>which is common to them all.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>True, if there were such a name.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Is not caring for herds common to them all, with no especial mention of feeding or any other activity?  If we called it an art of tending herds or caring for them or managing them, as all herdsmen do, we could wrap up the statesman with the rest, since the argument showed that we ought to do so.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Quite right;  but how would the next
<milestone unit="page" n="276"/><milestone n="276a" unit="section"/>division be made?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Just as we divided the art of feeding herds before by distinguishing between those that go on foot and the winged, and the unmixed breeds and the hornless, we might divide the art of tending herds by these same distinctions, embracing in the word both the kingship of the present time and that of the time of Cronus.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Evidently;  but again I wonder what the next step is.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>It Is clear that if we had used the word &ldquo;tending&rdquo; herds,
<milestone n="276b" unit="section"/>we should never have met with the contention that there is no caring for them at all in statesmanship, though the earlier contention was justified that there is no art in the case of human beings that deserves the name of feeding, and if there be such an art, it belongs much more to many others than to the king.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Quite right.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>But no other art would advance a stronger claim than that of kingship to be the art of caring for the whole human community
<milestone n="276c" unit="section"/>and ruling all mankind.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>You are right.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And after all this, Socrates, do we see that another great error was committed at the very end?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>What was it?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Why, it was this:  No matter how strong our belief that there was an art of feeding the biped herd, we ought not to have called it kingship and statecraft on the spot, as if it were all quite settled.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>What ought we to have done, then?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>In the first place, as we said, we ought to have remodelled the name,
<milestone n="276d" unit="section"/>making it denote care, rather than feeding, and then we ought to have divided the art, for it may still admit of not unimportant divisions.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>What are they?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>There is one by which we might have divided the divine shepherd from the human caretaker.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Quite right.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And again it was essential that the art of caretaking thus isolated and assigned to man be divided into two parts.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>On what line of division?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>On that of compulsory and voluntary.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Why is that?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Because this was about the point at which we made our mistake before;
<milestone n="276e" unit="section"/>we were more simple-minded than we should have been, and we put the king and the tyrant together, whereas they and their respective modes of ruling are quite unlike.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>True.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>But now shall we, as I said, correct ourselves and divide the care of humanity into two parts, by the criterion of the compulsory and the voluntary?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>By all means.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And if we call the art of those who use compulsion tyrannical or something of the sort and the voluntary care of voluntary bipeds political, may we not declare that he who possesses this latter art of caretaking is really the true king and statesman?
<milestone unit="page" n="277"/><milestone n="277a" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Well, Stranger, it looks as though our account of the statesman were complete now.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>That would be a fine thing for us, Socrates.  But not you alone must think so;  I must think so, too, in agreement with you.  As a matter of fact, however, in my opinion our figure of the king is not yet perfect, but like statue-makers who sometimes in their misapplied enthusiasm make too numerous and too large additions and thus delay the completion of their several works,
<milestone n="277b" unit="section"/>we too, at this time, wishing to make quick progress, and also to make clear in a grand style the error of our previous course, and, moreover, fancying that the use of great illustrations was proper in the case of a king, have taken up a marvellous mass of myth and have consequently been obliged to use a greater part of it than we should.  So we have made our discourse too long and after all have never made an end of the tale,
<milestone n="277c" unit="section"/>but our talk, just like a picture of a living creature, seems to have a good enough outline, but not yet to have received the clearness that comes from pigments and the blending of colors.  And yet it is more fitting to portray any living being by speech and argument than by painting or any handicraft whatsoever to persons who are able to follow argument;  but to others it is better to do it by means of works of craftsmanship.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>That is true;  but explain wherein you think our exposition is still deficient.
<milestone n="277d" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>It is difficult, my dear fellow, to set forth any of the greater ideas, except by the use of examples;  for it would seem that each of us knows everything that he knows as if in a dream and then again, when he is as it were awake, knows nothing of it all.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>What do you mean by that?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>I seem at present in absurd fashion to have touched upon our experience in regard to knowledge.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>In what respect?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Why, my friend, the very example I employ requires another example.<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">i.e. the nature of example is to be explained below by means of an example.  The example of the letters of the alphabet is employed also in the <bibl n="Plat. Theaet. 202">Plat. Theaet. 202 ff</bibl>, but the Stranger cannot properly refer to that, as he was not present at the time.  Or is this a dramatic slip on PlatoÕs part?</note>

<milestone n="277e" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Indeed?  What is it?  DonÕt hesitate to tell on my account.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>I will tell, since you on your part are prepared to listen.  We know that children, when they are just getting some knowledge of letters&mdash;</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Well?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Recognize the several letters well enough in the short and easy syllables, and can make correct statements about them.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Yes, of course.
<milestone unit="page" n="278"/><milestone n="278a" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And then again in other syllables they are in doubt about those same letters, and err in opinion and speech about them.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Yes, certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Would not the easiest and best way to lead them to the letters which they do not yet know be this?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>What?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>To lead them first to those cases in which they had correct opinions about these same letters and then to lead them and set them beside the groups which they did not yet recognize
<milestone n="278b" unit="section"/>and by comparing them to show that their nature is the same in both combinations alike, and to continue until the letters about which their opinions are correct have been shown in juxtaposition with all those of which they are ignorant.  Being shown in this way they become examples<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">There is here a play on the words <foreign lang="greek">PARA-TIQE/MENA DEIXQH=|, DEIXQE/NTA DE/, PARA-DEI/GMATA</foreign> Placed beside, they are shown and being shown, they become paradigms, i.e. objects of comparison, i.e. examples.</note> and bring it about that every letter is in all syllables always called by the same name, either by differentiation from the other letters,
<milestone n="278c" unit="section"/>in case it is different, or because it is the same.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Is this, then, a satisfactory definition, that an example is formed when that which is the same in some second unconnected thing is rightly conceived and compared with the first, so that the two together form one true idea?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Evidently.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Can we wonder, then, that our soul, whose nature involves it in the same uncertainty about the letters or elements of all things,
<milestone n="278d" unit="section"/>is sometimes in some cases firmly grounded in the truth about every detail, and again in other cases is all at sea about everything, and somehow or other has correct opinions about some combinations, and then again is ignorant of the same things when they are transferred to the long and difficult syllables of life?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Surely we need not wonder at that.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>No;  for could anyone, my friend, who begins with false opinion, ever attain to even a small
<milestone n="278e" unit="section"/>part of truth and acquire wisdom?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>No;  it is hardly possible.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Then if this is the case, would it be a bad thing if you and I first tried to see in another small and partial example the nature of example in general, with the intention of transferring afterwards the same figurative method from lesser things to the most exalted eminence of the king, and trying by means of an example to become acquainted in a scientific way with the management of states, in order that this may be waking knowledge for us, not dream knowledge?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>That is a very good idea.
<milestone unit="page" n="279"/><milestone n="279a" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Then we must take up our former argument again, and since there are countless others who contend that they, rather than the royal class, have the care of states, we must accordingly remove all these and isolate the king;  and, as we said, to accomplish this we need an example.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>What example could we apply which is very small, but has the same kind of activity as statesmanship and would enable us satisfactorily to discover that which we seek?
<milestone n="279b" unit="section"/> What do you say, Socrates, if we have nothing else at hand, to taking at random the art of weaving, and, if you please, not the whole of that?  For I fancy the art of weaving wool will be enough;  if we choose that part only it will probably furnish us with the illustration we desire.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Agreed.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Then just as we divided each subject before by cutting off parts from parts,
<milestone n="279c" unit="section"/>why not now apply the same process to the art of weaving and, by going through all the steps as briefly as we possibly can, arrive quickly at that which serves our present purpose?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>What do you mean?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>I will answer you by actually going through the process.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Excellent</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Well, then, all things which we make or acquire are for the sake of doing something or else they are for defence against suffering;  and of the defensive class some are spells and antidotes, both divine and human, and some are material defences;
<milestone n="279d" unit="section"/>and of the material defences some are equipment for war and some are protections;  and of protections some are screens and some are defences against heat and cold;  and such defences are either shelters or coverings;  and coverings are either rugs to spread under us or wrappings to wrap round us;  and wrappings are either all of one piece or composed of several pieces;
<milestone n="279e" unit="section"/>and of the composite garments some are stitched and others put together without stitching;  and of the unstitched some are made of the fibres of plants and some are of hair;  and of those made with hair some are stuck together with liquids and cement and others are fastened without any such extraneous matter.  Now to these protective coverings made of materials fastened without extraneous matter we give the name of clothes;
<milestone unit="page" n="280"/><milestone n="280a" unit="section"/>and just as we called the art statecraft which was concerned with the state, so we shall call the art concerned with clothes, from the nature of its activity, clothes-making, shall we not?  And may we say further that weaving, in so far as the greatest part of it is, as we saw, concerned with the making of clothes, differs in name only from this art of clothes-making, just as in the other case the royal art differed from statecraft?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>That is perfectly correct.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Let us next reflect that a person might think that this description of the art of weaving was satisfactory,
<milestone n="280b" unit="section"/>because he cannot understand that it has not yet been distinguished from the closely co-operative arts, though it has been separated from many other kindred arts.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>What kindred arts?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>You do not seem to have followed what I have been saying;  so I think I had better go back again and begin at the end.  For if you understand what I mean by kinship, we distinguished from clothing something akin to it a moment ago when we separated rugs from it by the distinction between spreading under and wrapping round.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>I understand.
<milestone n="280c" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And we removed the entire manufacture of cloth made from flax and broom-cords and all that we just now called vegetable fibres;  and then, too, we separated off the process of felting and the kind of joining that employs piercing and sewing, most important of which is the shoemakerÕs art.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Yes, to be sure.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And we separated off the art of making coverings of leather in single pieces and all the arts of making shelters, which we find in house-building and carpentering in general
<milestone n="280d" unit="section"/>and in other methods of protection against water, and all the arts which furnish protection against theft and acts of violence, the arts, that is to say, of making lids and constructing doors, which are regarded as parts of the joinerÕs art;  and we cut off the armorerÕs art, which is a section of the great and various function of making defences;  and at the very beginning we cut off the whole art of magic which is concerned with antidotes and spells,

<milestone n="280e" unit="section"/>and we have left, as it would seem, just the art we were seeking, which furnishes protection from the weather, manufactures a defence of wool, and is called the art of weaving.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>That seems to be the case.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>But, my boy, this is not yet completely stated;  for the man who is engaged in the first part of the making of clothes
<milestone unit="page" n="281"/><milestone n="281a" unit="section"/>appears to do something the opposite of weaving.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>How so?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>The process of weaving is, I take it, a kind of joining together.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>But the first part I refer to is a separation of what is combined and matted together.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>What do you mean?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>The work of the carderÕs art.  Or shall we have the face to say that carding is weaving and the carder is a weaver?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>No, certainly not.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And surely if we say the art of making the warp or the woof is the art of weaving,
<milestone n="281b" unit="section"/>we are employing an irrational and false designation.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Of course.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Well then, shall we say that the whole arts of fulling and mending are no part of the care and treatment of clothes, or shall we declare that these also are entirely included in the art of weaving?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>By no means.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>But surely all these will contest the claim of the art of weaving in the matter of the treatment and the production of clothes;  they will grant that the part of weaving is the most important, but will claim that their own parts are of some importance, too.
<milestone n="281c" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Yes, certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Then we must believe that besides these the arts which produce the tools by means of which the works of weaving are accomplished will claim to be collaborators in every work of weaving.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Quite right.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Will our definition of the art of weaving (I mean the part of it we selected) be satisfactory if we say that of all the activities connected with woollen clothing it is the noblest and the greatest?
<milestone n="281d" unit="section"/>Or would that, although it contains some truth, yet lack clearness and completeness until we separate from weaving all these other arts?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>You are right.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Then shall our next move be to do this, that our discussion may proceed in due order?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>First, then, let us observe that there are two arts involved in all production.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>What are they?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>The one is a contingent cause, the other is the actual cause.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>What do you mean?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Those arts which do not produce the actual thing in question,
<milestone n="281e" unit="section"/>but which supply to the arts which do produce it the tools without which no art could ever perform its prescribed work, may be called contingent causes, and those which produce the actual thing are causes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>At any rate, that is reasonable.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Next, then, shall we designate all the arts which produce spindles, shuttles, and the various other tools that partake in the production of clothing as contingent causes, and those which treat and manufacture the clothing itself as causes?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Quite right.
<milestone unit="page" n="282"/><milestone n="282a" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And among the causal arts we may properly include washing and mending and all the care of clothing in such ways;  and, since the art of adornment is a wide one, we may classify them as a part of it under the name of fulling.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Good.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And, again, carding and spinning and all the processes concerned with the actual fabrication of the clothing under consideration, form collectively one art familiar to every one&mdash;the art of wool-working.
<milestone n="282b" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Of course.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And wool-working comprises two divisions, and each of these is a part of two arts at once.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>How is that?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Carding, and one half of the use of the weaverÕs rod,<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">The weaverÕs rod (for the Greeks appear to have used a rod, not a comb) was used to drive the threads of the woof close together, and also to keep the threads of the warp and woof distinct (cf.  <bibl n="Plat. Crat. 388a">Plat. Crat. 388a</bibl>).  All the processes here described, familiar as they were to the ancients, have been done away with, or, at least, greatly modified, in <placeName key="tgn,1000003">Europe</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7012149">America</placeName> by the modern methods of industry.</note> and the other crafts which separate things that are joined&mdash;all this collectively is a part of the art of wool-working;  and in all things we found two great arts, that of composition and that of division.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Now carding and all the other processes just mentioned are parts of the art of division;
<milestone n="282c" unit="section"/>for the art of division in wool and threads, exercised in one way with the rod and in another with the hands, has all the names just mentioned.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Yes, certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Then let us again take up something which is at once a part of the arts of composition and of wool-working.  Let us put aside all that belongs to division, making two parts of wool-working, by applying the principles of division and of composition.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Let us make that distinction.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>The part which belongs at once to composition and to wool-working,
<milestone n="282d" unit="section"/>Socrates, you must allow us to divide again, if we are to get a satisfactory concept of the aforesaid art of weaving.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Then we must divide it.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Yes, we must;  and let us call one part of it the art of twisting threads, and the other the art of intertwining them.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>I am not sure I understand.  By the art of twisting I think you mean the making of the warp.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Not that only, but also the making of the woof.  We shall not find that the woof is made without twisting, shall we?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>No, of course not.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Well, just define warp and woof;  perhaps the definition
<milestone n="282e" unit="section"/>would serve you well at this junction.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>How shall I do it?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>In this way:  A piece of carded wool, which is lengthened out and is wide, is said to be a lap of wool, is it not?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And if any such lap of wool is twisted with a spindle and made into a hard thread, we call the thread warp, and the art which governs this process is the art of spinning the warp.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Right.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And the threads, in turn, which are more loosely twisted and have in respect to the force used in the carding a softness adapted to the interweaving with the warp we will call the woof, and the art devoted to these
<milestone unit="page" n="283"/><milestone n="283a" unit="section"/>we will call the art of preparing the woof.<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">i.e. the pull (<foreign lang="greek">O(LKH/</foreign>)of the carderÕs comb was less strong in the preparation of the threads of the woof than in that of the threads of the warp.</note></p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Quite right.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>So now the part of the art of weaving which we chose for our discussion is clear to pretty much every understanding;  for when that part of the art of composition which is included in the art of weaving forms a web by the right intertwining of woof and warp, we call the entire web a woollen garment, and the art which directs this process we call weaving.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Quite right.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Very good.  Then why in the world did we not say at once
<milestone n="283b" unit="section"/>that weaving is the intertwining of woof and warp?  Why did we beat about the bush and make a host of futile distinctions?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>For my part, I thought nothing that was said was futile, Stranger.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And no wonder;  but perhaps you might change your mind.  Now to avoid any such malady, in case it should, as is not unlikely, attack you frequently hereafter, I will propose a principle of procedure which is applicable
<milestone n="283c" unit="section"/>to all cases of this sort.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Do so.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>First, then, let us scrutinize the general nature of excess and deficiency, for the sake of obtaining a rational basis for any praise or blame we may bestow upon excessive length or brevity in discussions of this kind.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Yes, that is a good thing to do.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Then the proper subjects for our consideration would, I fancy, be these.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>What?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Length and shortness and excess and deficiency in general;
<milestone n="283d" unit="section"/>for all of them may be regarded as the subjects of the art of measurement.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Let us, then, divide that art into two parts;  that is essential for our present purpose.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Please tell how to make the division.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>In this way:  one part is concerned with relative greatness or smallness, the other with the something without which production would not be possible.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>What do you mean?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Do you not think that, by the nature of the case, we must say that the greater is greater than the less and than nothing else,
<milestone n="283e" unit="section"/>and that the less is less than the greater and than nothing else?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>But must we not also assert the real existence of excess beyond the standard of the mean, and of inferiority to the mean, whether in words or deeds, and is not the chief difference between good men and bad found in such excess or deficiency?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>That is clear.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Then we must assume that there are these two kinds of great and small, and these two ways of distinguishing between them;  we must not, as we did a little while ago, say that they are relative to one another only, but rather, as we have just said, that one kind is relative in that way, and the other is relative to the standard of the mean.  Should we care to learn the reason for this?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Of course.
<milestone unit="page" n="284"/><milestone n="284a" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>If we assert that the greater has no relation to anything except the less, it will never have any relation to the standard of the mean, will it?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>No.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Will not this doctrine destroy the arts and their works one and all, and do away also with statesmanship, which we are now trying to define, and with weaving, which we did define?  For all these are doubtless careful about excess and deficiency in relation to the standard of the mean; they regard them not as non-existent, but as real difficulties in actual practice,
<milestone n="284b" unit="section"/>and it is in this way, when they preserve the standard of the mean, that all their works are good and beautiful.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And if we do away with the art of statesmanship, our subsequent search for the kingly art will be hopeless, will it not?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Then just as in the case of the sophist<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb"><bibl n="Plat. Soph. 235">Plat. Soph. 235</bibl></note> we forced the conclusion that not-being exists, since that was the point at which we had lost our hold of the argument, so now we must force this second conclusion, that the greater and the less are to be measured in relation,
<milestone n="284c" unit="section"/>not only to one another, but also to the establishment of the standard of the mean, must we not?  For if this is not admitted, neither the statesman nor any other man who has knowledge of practical affairs can be said without any doubt to exist.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Then we must by all means do now the same that we did then.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>This, Socrates, is a still greater task than that was;  and yet we remember how long that took us;  but it is perfectly fair to make about them some such assumption as this.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>As what?
<milestone n="284d" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>That sometime we shall need this principle of the mean for the demonstration of absolute precise truth.  But our belief that the demonstration is for our present purpose good and sufficient is, in my opinion, magnificently supported by this argument&mdash;that we must believe that all the arts alike exist and that the greater and the less are measured in relation not only to one another but also to the establishment of the standard of the mean.  For if this exists, they exist also, and if they exist, it exists also, but neither can ever exist if the other does not.
<milestone n="284e" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>That is quite right.  But what comes next?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>We should evidently divide the science of measurement into two parts in accordance with what has been said.  One part comprises all the arts which measure number, length, depth, breadth, and thickness in relation to their opposites;  the other comprises those which measure them in relation to the moderate, the fitting, the opportune, the needful, and all the other standards that are situated in the mean between the extremes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Both of your divisions are extensive, and there is a great difference between them.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Yes, for what many clever persons occasionally say, Socrates, fancying that it is a wise remark,
<milestone unit="page" n="285"/><milestone n="285a" unit="section"/>namely, that the science of measurement has to do with everything, is precisely the same as what we have just said.  For in a certain way all things which are in the province of art do partake of measurement;  but because people are not in the habit of considering things by dividing them into classes, they hastily put these widely different relations<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">i.e. relations to each other and relations to the standard of the mean.</note> into the same category, thinking they are alike;  and again they do the opposite of this when they fail to divide other things into parts.  What they ought to do is this:  when a person at first sees only the unity or common quality of many things,
<milestone n="285b" unit="section"/>he must not give up until he sees all the differences in them, so far as they exist in classes;  and conversely, when all sorts of dissimilarities are seen in a large number of objects he must find it impossible to be discouraged or to stop until has gathered into one circle of similarity all the things which are related to each other and has included them in some sort of class on the basis of their essential nature.  No more need be said, then, about this or about deficiency and excess;  let us only bear carefully in mind that two kinds of measurement which apply to them have been found,
<milestone n="285c" unit="section"/>and let us remember what those kinds are.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>We will remember.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Now that we have finished this discussion, let us take up another which concerns the actual objects of our inquiry and the conduct of such discussions in general.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>What is it?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Suppose we were asked the following question about a group of pupils learning their letters:  &ldquo;When a pupil is asked of what letters some word or other composed,
<milestone n="285d" unit="section"/>is the question asked for the sake of the one particular word before him or rather to make him more learned about all words in the lesson?&rdquo;</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Clearly to make him more learned about them all.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And how about our own investigation of the statesman?  Has it been undertaken for the sake of his particular subject or rather to make us better thinkers about all subjects?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Clearly this also is done with a view to them all.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Of course no man of sense would wish to pursue the discussion of weaving for its own sake;  but most people, it seems to me, fail to notice that some things have sensible resemblances which are easily perceived;
<milestone n="285e" unit="section"/>and it is not at all difficult to show them when anyone wishes, in response to a request for an explanation of some one of them, to exhibit them easily without trouble and really without explanation.  But, on the other hand, the greatest and noblest conceptions
<milestone unit="page" n="286"/><milestone n="286a" unit="section"/>have no image wrought plainly for human vision, which he who wishes to satisfy the mind of the inquirer can apply to some one of his senses and by mere exhibition satisfy the mind.  We must therefore endeavor by practice to acquire the power of giving and understanding a rational definition of each one of them;  for immaterial things, which are the noblest and greatest, can be exhibited by reason only, and it is for their sake that all we are saying is said.  But it is always easier to practise
    <milestone n="286b" unit="section"/>in small matters than in greater ones.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Excellent.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Let us, then, remember the reason for all that we have said about these matters.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>What is the reason?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>The reason is chiefly just that irritating impatience which we exhibited in relation to the long talk about weaving and the revolution of the universe and the sophist's long talk about the existence of not-being.<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">See <bibl n="Plat. Theaet. 283">Plat. theaet. 283</bibl>, <bibl n="Plat. Theaet. 277">Plat. Theaet. 277</bibl>, <bibl n="Plat. Soph. 261">Plat. Soph. 261</bibl></note> We felt that they were too long, and we reproached ourselves for all of them,
<milestone n="286c" unit="section"/>fearing that our talk was not only long, but irrelevant.  Consider, therefore, that the reason for what has just been said is my wish to avoid any such impatience in the future.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Very well.  Please go on with what you have to say.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>What I have to say, then, is that you and I, remembering what has just been said, must praise or blame the brevity or length of our several discussions, not by comparing their various lengths with one another, but with reference to that part of the science of measurement
<milestone n="286d" unit="section"/>which we said before must be borne in mind;  I mean the standard of fitness.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Quite right.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>But we must not always judge of length by fitness, either.  For we shall not in the least want a length that is fitted to give pleasure, except, perhaps, as a secondary consideration;  and again reason counsels us to accept fitness for the easiest and quickest completion of the inquiry in which we are engaged, not as the first, but as the second thing to be desired.  By far our first and most important object should be to exalt the method itself of ability to divide by classes,
<milestone n="286e" unit="section"/>and therefore, if a discourse, even though it be very long, makes the hearer better able to discover the truth, we should accept it eagerly and should not be offended by its length, or if it is short, we should judge it in the same way.  And, moreover, anyone who finds fault with the length of discourses in our discussions, or objects to roundabout methods, must not merely find fault with the speeches for their length and then pass them quickly and hastily by,
<milestone unit="page" n="287"/><milestone n="287a" unit="section"/>but he must also show that there is ground for the belief that if they had been briefer they would have made their hearers better dialecticians and quicker to discover through reason the truth of realities.  About other people and the praise or blame they direct towards other qualities in discourse, we need not be concerned;  we need not even appear to hear them.  But enough of this, if you feel about it as I do;  so let us go back to the statesman
<milestone n="287b" unit="section"/>and apply to him the example of weaving that we spoke of a while ago.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Very well;  let us do so.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>The art of the king, then, has been separated from most of the kindred arts, or rather from all the arts that have to do with herds.  There remain, however, the arts that have to do with the state itself.  These are both causes and contingent causes, and our first duty is to separate them from one another.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Quite right.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>It is not easy to divide them into halves, you know.
<milestone n="287c" unit="section"/>But I think the reason will nevertheless be clear as we go on.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Then we had better divide in another way.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Let us divide them, then, like an animal that is sacrificed, by joints, since we cannot bisect them;  for we must always divide into a number of parts as near two as possible.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>How shall we do it in the present instance?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Just as in the previous case, you know, we classed all the arts which furnished tools for weaving as contingent causes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>So now we must do the same thing, but it is even more imperative.
<milestone n="287d" unit="section"/>For all the arts which furnish any implement, great or small, for the state, must be classed as contingent causes;  for without them neither state nor statesmanship could ever exist, and yet I do not suppose we shall reckon any of them as the work of the kingly art.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>No.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>We shall certainly be undertaking a hard task in separating this class from the rest;  for it might be said that everything that exists is the instrument of something or other, and the statement seems plausible.  But there are possessions of another kind in the state,
<milestone n="287e" unit="section"/>about which I wish to say something.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>What do you wish to say?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>That they do not possess this instrumental function.  For they are not, like tools or instruments, made for the purpose of being causes of production, but exist for the preservation of that which has been produced.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>What is this class of possessions?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>That very various class which is made with dry and wet materials and such as are wrought by fire and without fire;  it is called collectively the class of receptacles;  it is a very large class and has, so far as I can see,
<milestone unit="page" n="288"/><milestone n="288a" unit="section"/>nothing at all to do with the art we are studying.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>No, of course not.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And there is a third very large class of possessions to be noticed, differing from these;  it is found on land and on water, it wanders about and is stationary, it is honorable and without honor, but it has one name, because the whole class is always a seat for some one and exists to be sat upon.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>What is it?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>We call it a vehicle, and it certainly is not at all the work of statesmanship, but much rather that of the arts of carpentry, pottery and bronze-working.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>I understand.
<milestone n="288b" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And is there a fourth class?  Shall we say that there is one, differing from those three, one to which most of the things we have mentioned belong&mdash;all clothing, most arms, all circuit walls of earth or of stone, and countless other things?  And since they are all made for defence, they may most rightly be called by the collective name of defence, and this may much more properly be considered for the most part the work of the art of building or of weaving than of statesmanship.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Certainly.
<milestone n="288c" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And should we care to make a fifth class, of ornamentation and painting and all the imitations created by the use of painting and music solely for our pleasure and properly included under one name?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>What is its name?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>It is called by some such name as plaything.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>To be sure.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>So this one name will properly be applied to all the members of this class;  for none of them is practised for any serious purpose, but all of them merely for play.
<milestone n="288d" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>I understand that pretty well, too.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And shall we not make a sixth class of that which furnishes to all these the materials of which and in which all the arts we have mentioned fashion their works, a very various class, the offspring of many other arts?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>What do you mean?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Gold and silver and all the products of the mines and all the materials which tree-felling and wood-cutting in general cut and provide for carpentry and basket-weaving;  and then, too, the art of stripping the bark from plants and the leather-workerÕs art which takes off the skins of animals,

<milestone n="288e" unit="section"/>and all the other arts which have to do with such matters, and those that make corks and paper and cords and enable us to manufacture composite classes of things from kinds that are not composite.  We call all this, as one class, the primary and simple possession of man, and it is in no way the work of the kingly science.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Good.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And property in food and all the things which, mingling parts of themselves with parts of the body, have any function of keeping it in health,
<milestone unit="page" n="289"/><milestone n="289a" unit="section"/>we may say is the seventh class, and we will call it collectively our nourishment, unless we have some better name to give it.  All this we can assign to the arts of husbandry, hunting, gymnastics, medicine, and cooking more properly than to that of statesmanship.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Of course.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Now I think I have in these seven classes mentioned nearly all kinds of property except tame animals.  See:  there was the primary possession, which ought in justice to have been placed first, and after this
<milestone n="289b" unit="section"/>the instrument, receptacle, vehicle, defence, plaything, nourishment.  Whatever we have omitted, unless some important thing has been overlooked, can find its place in one of those classes;  for instance, the group of coins, seals, and stamps, for there is not among these any kinship such as to form a large class, but some of them can be made to fit into the class of ornaments, others into that of instruments, though the classification is somewhat forced.  All property in tame animals,
<milestone n="289c" unit="section"/>except slaves, is included in the art of herding, which has already been divided into parts.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Yes quite true.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>There remains the class of slaves and servants in general, and here I prophesy that we shall find those who set up claims against the king for the very fabric of his art, just as the spinners and carders and the rest of whom we spoke advanced claims against the weavers a while ago.  All the others, whom we called contingent causes, have been removed along with the works we just mentioned and have been separated
<milestone n="289d" unit="section"/>from the activity of the king and the statesman.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>That seems to be the case, at least.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Come then, let us step up and look from close at hand at those who are left, that so we may know them more surely.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Yes, that is what we should do.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>We shall find, then, that the greatest servants, when seen from near at hand, are in conduct and condition the opposite of that which we suspected.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Who are they?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>The bought servants, acquired by purchase, whom we can without question call slaves.
<milestone n="289e" unit="section"/>They make no claim to any share in the kingly art.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Certainly not.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>How about those free men who put themselves voluntarily in the position of servants of those whom we mentioned before?  I mean the men who carry about and distribute among one another the productions of husbandry and the other arts, whether in the domestic marketplaces or by travelling from city to city by land or sea, exchanging money for wares or money for money, the men whom we call brokers,
<milestone unit="page" n="290"/><milestone n="290a" unit="section"/>merchants, shipmasters, and peddlers;  do they lay any claim to statesmanship?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Possibly to commercial statesmanship</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>But certainly we shall never find laborers, whom we see only too glad to serve anybody for hire, claiming a share in the kingly art.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Certainly not.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>But there are people who perform services of another kind.  How about them?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>What services and what men do you mean?
<milestone n="290b" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>The class of heralds and those who become by long practice skilled as clerks and other clever men who perform various services in connection with public offices.  What shall we call them?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>What you called the others, servants;  they are not themselves rulers in the states.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>But surely it was no dream that made me say we should find somewhere in this region those who more than others lay claim to the art of statesmanship;  and yet it would be utterly absurd
<milestone n="290c" unit="section"/>to look for them in any servile position.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>But let us draw a little closer still to those whom we have not yet examined.  There are men who have to do with divination and possess a portion of a certain menial science;  for they are supposed to be interpreters of the gods to men.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And then, too, the priests, according to law and custom, know how to give the gods, by means of sacrifices, the gifts that please them from us
<milestone n="290d" unit="section"/>and by prayers to ask for us the gain of good things from them;  now these are both part of a servantÕs art.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>At least they seem to be so.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>At last, then, I think we are, as it were, on the track of our quarry.  For the bearing of the priests and prophets is indeed full of pride, and they win high esteem because of the magnitude of their undertakings.  In <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>, for example, no king can rule without being a priest,
<milestone n="290e" unit="section"/>and if he happens to have forced his way to the throne from some other class, he must enroll himself in the class of priests afterwards;  and among the Greeks, too, you would find that in many states the performance of the greatest public sacrifices is a duty imposed upon the highest officials.  Yes, among you Athenians this is very plain, for they say the holiest and most national of the ancient sacrifices are performed by the man whom the lot has chosen to be the King.<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">The second in order of the nine annual archons.</note></p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Yes, certainly.
<milestone unit="page" n="291"/><milestone n="291a" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>We must, then, examine these elected kings and priests and their assistants, and also another very large crowd of people which has just come in sight now that the others are out of the way.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Who are these people?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>A very queer lot.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>How so?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>They are of very mixed race at least they seem so now, when I can just see them.  For many of them are like lions and centaurs and other fierce creatures,
<milestone n="291b" unit="section"/>and very many are like satyrs and the weak and cunning beasts;  and they make quick exchanges of forms and qualities with one another.  Ah, but now, Socrates, I think I have just made out who they are.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Tell me;  for you seem to have caught sight of something strange.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Yes, for ignorance makes things seem strange to everybody.  That was what happened to me just now;  when I suddenly caught sight of them I did not recognize the troop of those who busy themselves
<milestone n="291c" unit="section"/>with the affairs of the state.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>What troop?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>That which of all the sophists is the greatest charlatan and most practised in charlatanry.  This, although it is a hard thing to do, must be separated from the band of really statesmanlike and kingly men, if we are to get a clear view of the object of our search.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>But we certainly cannot give that up.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>No, of course not.  I agree to that.  And now please answer a question.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>What is it?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>We agree that monarchy is one of the forms
<milestone n="291d" unit="section"/>of government, do we not?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And after monarchy one might, I should say, mention the rule of the few.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Yes, of course.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And a third form of government is the rule of the multitude, called democracy, is it not?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Yes, certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Do not these three become after a fashion five, producing out of themselves two additional names?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>What names?
<milestone n="291e" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>People nowadays are likely to take into consideration enforced subjection and voluntary obedience, poverty and wealth, law and lawlessness as they occur in governments, and so they divide two of the forms we mentioned, giving to the two aspects of monarchy the two names tyranny and royalty.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And the state that is ruled by the few is called, as the case may be, aristocracy or oligarchy.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>To be sure.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>In the case of democracy, however,
<milestone unit="page" n="292"/><milestone n="292a" unit="section"/>whether the multitude rule those who have property by violence or with their willing consent, and whether the laws are carefully observed or not, no one ever habitually changes the name.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>True.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Now then, do we believe that any of these forms of government which are defined by the distinctions between the one, the few, and the many, or wealth and poverty, or violence and willingness, or written constitution and absence of laws, is a right one?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>I donÕt see why not.

<milestone n="292b" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Look a bit more closely along the line I am going to point out.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>What is it?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Shall we abide by what we said in the beginning, or dissent from it?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>To what do you refer?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>We said, I believe, that royal power was one of the sciences.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And not only a science, but we selected it from the rest as a science of judgement and command.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And from the science of command we distinguished one part which rules inanimate works,
<milestone n="292c" unit="section"/>and one which rules living beings;  and so we have gone on dividing in this manner to the present moment, never forgetting that it is a science, but as yet unable to state with sufficient accuracy what science it is.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>You are right.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Then is this our understanding, that the distinction between forms of government ought not to be found in the words few or many, or voluntary or unwilling, or wealth or poverty, but some science must be the distinguishing feature, if we are to be consistent with our previous statement?
<milestone n="292d" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Yes, indeed;  it cannot be otherwise.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Necessarily, then, our present duty is to inquire in which, if any, of these forms of government is engendered the science of ruling men, which is about the greatest of sciences and the most difficult to acquire.  We must discover that in order to see what men are to be distinguished from the wise king&mdash;men, I mean, who pretend to be, and make many believe that they are, statesmen, but are really not such at all.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Yes, we must do this;  that is implied in what was said before.
<milestone n="292e" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Does it seem at all possible that a multitude in a state could acquire this science?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>By no means.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>But in a state of one thousand men could perhaps a hundred or as many as fifty acquire it adequately?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>No, in that case this would be the easiest of all the arts; for we know that a city of a thousand men could never produce that number of finished draught-players in comparison with those in other Greek cities, still less so many kings.  For the man who possesses the kingly science, whether he rule or not,
<milestone unit="page" n="293"/><milestone n="293a" unit="section"/>must be called kingly, as our previous argument showed.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>You did well to remind me.  And in agreement with this, we must, I suppose, look for the right kind of rule in one or two or very few men, whenever such right rule occurs.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And these men, whether they rule over willing or unwilling subjects, with or without written laws, and whether they are rich or poor, must, according to our present opinion, be supposed to exercise their rule in accordance with some art or science.
<milestone n="293b" unit="section"/>And physicians offer a particularly good example of this point of view.  Whether they cure us against our will or with our will, by cutting us or burning us or causing us pain in any other way, and whether they do it by written rules or without them, and whether they are rich or poor, we call them physicians just the same, so long as they exercise authority by art or science, purging us or reducing us in some other way, or even adding to our weight, provided only that they who treat their patients treat them for the benefit of their health
<milestone n="293c" unit="section"/>and preserve them by making them better than they were.  In this way and no other, in my opinion, shall we determine this to be the only right definition of the rule of the physician or of any other rule whatsoever.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Very true.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>It is, then, a necessary consequence that among forms of government that one is preeminently right and is the only real government, in which the rulers are found to be truly possessed of science, not merely to seem to possess it, whether they rule by law or without law, whether their subjects are willing or unwilling,
<milestone n="293d" unit="section"/>and whether they themselves are rich or poor&mdash;none of these things can be at all taken into account on any right method.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Excellent.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And whether they purge the state for its good by killing or banishing some of the citizens, or make it smaller by sending out colonies somewhere, as bees swarm from the hive, or bring in citizens from elsewhere to make it larger, so long as they act in accordance with science and justice and preserve and benefit it by making it better than it was, so far as is possible,
<milestone n="293e" unit="section"/>that must at that time and by such characteristics be declared to be the only right form of government.  All other forms must be considered not as legitimate or really existent, but as imitating this;  those states which are said to be well governed imitate it better, and the others worse.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Everything else that you have said seems reasonable;  but that government should be carried on without laws is a hard saying.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>You got ahead of me a little with your question, Socrates;
<milestone unit="page" n="294"/><milestone n="294a" unit="section"/>for I was just going to ask whether you accepted all I have said, or were displeased with anything.  But now it is clear that we shall have to discuss the question of the propriety of government without laws.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Of course we shall.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>In a sense, however, it is clear that law-making belongs to the science of kingship;  but the best thing is not that the laws be in power, but that the man who is wise and of kingly nature be ruler.  Do you see why?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Why is it?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Because law could never, by determining exactly what is noblest
<milestone n="294b" unit="section"/>and must just for one and all, enjoin upon them that which is best;  for the differences of men and of actions and the fact that nothing, I may say, in human life is ever at rest, forbid any science whatsoever to promulgate any simple rule for everything and for all time.  We agree to that, I suppose?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Yes, of course.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>But we see that law aims at pretty nearly this very thing, like a stubborn and ignorant man
<milestone n="294c" unit="section"/>who allows no one to do anything contrary to his command, or even to ask a question, not even if something new occurs to some one, which is better than the rule he has himself ordained.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>True;  the law treats each and all of us exactly as you describe.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>So that which is persistently simple is inapplicable to things which are never simple?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>I suppose so.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Why in the world, then, is it necessary to make laws, since law is not the most perfect right?
<milestone n="294d" unit="section"/>We must ask the reason for this.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Yes, of course.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Well, there are here at <placeName key="tgn,7001393">Athens</placeName>, as in other cities, classes for practice in athletics to prepare for contests in running or the like, are there not?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Yes, a great many of them.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Now let us recall to mind the orders given by the professional trainers when they are in charge of such classes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>What do you mean?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>They think they cannot go into details in individual cases and order what is best for each personÕs physique;

<milestone n="294e" unit="section"/>they think they must employ a rougher method and give a general rule which will be good for the physique of the majority.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Good.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And therefore they nowadays assign equal exercise to whole classes;  they make them begin at the same time and stop at the same time, whether they run or wrestle or practise any other kind of bodily exercise.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>That is true.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And so we must believe that the law-maker who is to watch over the herds and maintain justice and the obligation of contracts,
<milestone unit="page" n="295"/><milestone n="295a" unit="section"/>will never be able by making laws for all collectively, to provide exactly that which is proper for each individual.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Probably not, at any rate.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>But he will, I fancy, legislate for the majority and in a general way only roughly for individuals, whether he issues written laws or his enactments follow the unwritten traditional customs.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Quite right.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Yes, quite right.  For how could anyone, Socrates,
<milestone n="295b" unit="section"/>sit beside each person all his life and tell him exactly what is proper for him to do?  Certainly anyone who really possessed the kingly science, if he were able to do this, would hardly, I imagine, ever put obstacles in his own way by writing what we call laws.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>No, at least not according to what has just been said.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Or rather, my friend, not according to what is going to be said.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>What is that?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Something of this sort:  Let us suppose
<milestone n="295c" unit="section"/>that a physician or a gymnastic trainer is going away and expects to be a long time absent from his patients or pupils; if he thinks they will not remember his instructions, he would want to write them down, would he not?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>What if he should come back again after a briefer absence than he expected?  Would he not venture to substitute other rules for those written instructions if others happened to be better for his patients,
<milestone n="295d" unit="section"/>because the winds or something else had, by act of God, changed unexpectedly from their usual course?  Would he persist in the opinion that no one must transgress the old laws, neither he himself by enacting new ones nor his patient by venturing to do anything contrary to the written rules, under the conviction that these laws were medicinal and healthful and anything else was unhealthful and unscientific?  If anything of that sort occurred in the realm of science and true art,
<milestone n="295e" unit="section"/>would not any such regulations on any subject assuredly arouse the greatest ridicule?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Most assuredly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>But he who has made written or unwritten laws about the just and unjust, the honorable and disgraceful, the good and the bad for the herds of men that are tended in their several cities in accordance with the laws of the law-makers, is not to be permitted to give other laws contrary to those, if the scientific law-maker, or another like him, should come!
<milestone unit="page" n="296"/><milestone n="296a" unit="section"/>Would not such a prohibition appear in truth as ridiculous as the other?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>It certainly would.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Do you know what people in general say about such a case?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>I donÕt recall it just now off-hand.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Yes, it is very plausible;  for they say that if anyone has anything better than the old laws to offer, he must first persuade the state, and then he may make his laws, but not otherwise.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>And is that not right?
<milestone n="296b" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Perhaps.  But suppose a man does not use persuasion, but makes an improvement by force.  What is this force to be called?  Answer me&mdash;or, no, not yet;  first answer in reference to what we were talking of before.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>What do you mean?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Suppose a physician who has right knowledge of his profession does not persuade, but forces, his patient, whether man, woman, or child, to do the better thing, though it be contrary to the written precepts, what will such violence be called?  The last name in the world to call it would be &ldquo;unscientific and baneful error,&rdquo; as the phrase is, would it not?
<milestone n="296c" unit="section"/>And the patient so forced might rightly say anything else rather than that he had been treated in a baneful or unscientific way by the physicians who used force upon him.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Very true.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>But what can we call the unscientific error in the field of statesmanship?  Is it not baseness and evil and injustice?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Now if people are forced, contrary to the written laws and inherited traditions, to do what is juster and nobler and better than what they did before,
<milestone n="296d" unit="section"/>tell me, will not anyone who blames such use of force, unless he is to be most utterly ridiculous, always say anything or everything rather than that those who have been so forced have suffered base and unjust and evil treatment at the hands of those who forced them?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Very true.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>But would the violence be just if he who uses it is rich, and unjust if he is poor?  Or if a man, whether rich or poor, by persuasion or by other means, in accordance with written laws or contrary to them, does what is for the good of the people, must not this be the truest criterion of right government,
<milestone n="296e" unit="section"/>in accordance with which the wise and good man will govern the affairs of his subjects?  Just as the captain of a ship keeps watch for what is at any moment for the good of the vessel and the sailors,
<milestone unit="page" n="297"/><milestone n="297a" unit="section"/>not by writing rules, but by making his science his law, and thus preserves his fellow voyagers, so may not a right government be established in the same way by men who could rule by this principle, making science more powerful than the laws?  And whatever the wise rulers do, they can commit no error, so long as they maintain one great principle and by always dispensing absolute justice to them
<milestone n="297b" unit="section"/>with wisdom and science are able to preserve the citizens and make them better than they were, so far as that is possible.  Is not this true?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>There is no denying the truth of what you have just said.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And those other statements cannot be denied, either.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>What statements?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>That no great number of men, whoever they may be, could ever acquire political science and be able to administer a state with wisdom,
<milestone n="297c" unit="section"/>but our one right form of government must be sought in some small number or one person, and all other forms are merely, as we said before, more or less successful imitations of that.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>What do you mean by that?  I did not understand about the imitations a little while ago, either.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And yet it is quite a serious matter if after stirring up this question we drop it and do not go on and show the error
<milestone n="297d" unit="section"/>which is committed in relation to it nowadays.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>What is the error?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>I will tell you what we must investigate;  it is not at all familiar or easy to see, but let us try to grasp it nevertheless.  Tell me this:  Assuming that the form of government we have described is the only right form, donÕt you see that the other forms must employ its written laws if they are to be preserved by doing that which is approved of nowadays, although it is not perfectly right?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>What is not perfectly right?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>That no citizen shall dare to do anything contrary to the laws, and that he who does shall be punished by death
    <milestone n="297e" unit="section"/>and the most extreme penalties.  And this is perfectly right and good as a second choice, as soon as you depart from the first form of which we were just speaking.  Now let us tell in some detail how this which we called the second choice comes about.  Shall we do so?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>By all means.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Let us return once more to the images which we always have to use in portraying kingly rulers.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>What images?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>The noble captain of a ship and the &ldquo;physician who is worth as much as many others.<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">Cf. <bibl n="Hom.

The image of the captain (for the Greek <foreign lang="greek">KUBERNH/THS</foreign> had an importance commensurate with that of the captain, rather than of the pilot, in modern times) has just been used.  See also <bibl n="Plat. Rep. 6.488a">Plat. Rep. 6.488 A</bibl>; <bibl n="Plat. Laws 12.963b">Plat. Laws 12.963 B</bibl>.</note>&rdquo;  Let us make a simile of them and use it to help us to discover something.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>What is your simile?
<milestone unit="page" n="298"/><milestone n="298a" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Something of this sort:  Imagine that we all thought in regard to captains and physicians:  &ldquo;We are most abominably treated by them.  For whomsoever of us either of them wishes to save, he saves, one of them just like the other, and whomsoever he wishes to maltreat, he maltreats.  They cut us up and burn us and order us to bring them payments of money, as if they were exacting tribute, of which they spend little or nothing for their patients;  they themselves and their servants use the rest.
<milestone n="298b" unit="section"/>And finally they are bribed by the patientÕs relatives or enemies and actually bring about his death.  And as for the captains, they commit countless other misdeeds they make plots and leave us deserted ashore when they put out to sea, they bring on mishaps at sea and so cast us into the water, and are guilty of other wrong-doings.&rdquo;  Now suppose, with these thoughts in mind, we deliberated about them

<milestone n="298c" unit="section"/>and decided that we would no longer allow either of these arts to rule without control over slaves or free men, but that we would call an assembly either of all the people or of the rich only, and that anyone, whether he were engaged in some other form of skilled labor or were without any special qualifications, should be free to offer an opinion about navigation and diseases, how drugs and surgical or medical instruments should be applied to the patients, and how
<milestone n="298d" unit="section"/>ships and nautical instruments should be used for navigation and in meeting dangers, not only those of winds and sea that affect the voyage itself, but also those met in encounters with pirates, and if battles have to be fought between ships of war;  and that whatever the majority decided about these matters, whether any physicians or ship captains or merely unskilled persons took part in the deliberations, should be inscribed upon tablets and slabs
<milestone n="298e" unit="section"/>or in some instances should be adopted as unwritten ancestral customs, and that henceforth forever navigation and the care of the sick should be conducted in accordance with these provisions.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>That is a most absurd state of things that you have described.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And suppose that rulers of the people are set up annually, whether from the rich or from the whole people, on the principle that whoever is chosen by lot should rule, and that these rulers exercise their authority in commanding the ships or treating the sick in accordance with the written rules.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>That is still harder to imagine.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Now consider what comes next.  When the year of office has passed for each set of rulers, there will have to be sessions of courts in which the judges are chosen by lot
<milestone unit="page" n="299"/><milestone n="299a" unit="section"/>either from a selected list of the rich or from the whole people, and the rulers will have to be brought before these courts and examined as to their conduct in office, and anyone who pleases can bring against the captains an accusation for failure to command the ships during the year in accordance with the written laws or the ancestral customs, and similarly against the physicians for their treatment of the sick;  and if any of them is found guilty, the court shall decide what his punishment or his fine shall be.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Surely anyone who consents voluntarily
    <milestone n="299b" unit="section"/>to hold office under such conditions would richly deserve any penalty or fine that might be imposed.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And then, in addition to all this, there will have to be a law that if anyone is found to be investigating the art of pilotage or navigation or the subject of health and true medical doctrine about winds and things hot and cold, contrary to the written rules, or to be indulging in any speculation whatsoever on such matters, he shall in the first place not be called a physician or a ship captain, but a star-gazer,<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">This passage obviously refers to the trial of Socrates.  The word <foreign lang="greek">METE/WRA</foreign> was used by those who made all sorts of general accusations against Socrates (see <bibl n="Plat. Apol. 18b">Plat.

<milestone n="299c" unit="section"/>to attack the arts of navigation and medicine in opposition to the laws and to govern the ships and the sick according to their own will;  and if he is found to be so persuading either young or old contrary to the laws and written rules, he shall suffer the most extreme penalties.  Nothing, they say, ought to be wiser than the laws;  for no one is ignorant of medicine and the laws of health or of the pilotÕs art and navigation, since anyone who pleases can learn

<milestone n="299d" unit="section"/>the existing written rules and ancestral customs.  Now if these regulations which I speak of were to be applied to these sciences, Socrates, and to strategy and every part of the entire art of hunting and to painting or every kind of imitation and to carpentry including every kind of utensil-making, or even to husbandry and all the art that is concerned with plants, or if we were to see an art of horse-breeding conducted by written rules, or herdsmanship in general or prophecy or everything that is included in the art of serving,
<milestone n="299e" unit="section"/>or draught-playing or the whole science of number, whether arithmetic or plane geometry or solid geometry or problems of motion&mdash;what would you think of carrying on all these in such a way, by written rules and not by knowledge?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Clearly all the arts would be utterly ruined, nor could they ever rise again, through the operation of the law prohibiting investigation;  and so life, which is hard enough now,
<milestone unit="page" n="300"/><milestone n="300a" unit="section"/>would then become absolutely unendurable.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Here is a further point.  If we ordained that each of the aforesaid arts must be carried on by written rules and that the observance of our written rules be under the charge of the man who is elected or chosen by lot, but he should disregard the written rules and for the sake of some gain or to do a favor to some one should try to act contrary to them, without possessing any knowledge, would not this be a greater evil than the former?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Most assuredly.
<milestone n="300b" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Since the laws are made after long experience and after commissioners of some kind have carefully considered each detail with delicate skill and have persuaded the people to pass them, anyone, I fancy, who ventured to violate them would be involved in error many times greater than the first, and would cause even greater ruin than the written laws to all kinds of transactions.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Of course he would.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Therefore the next best course for those who make laws or

<milestone unit="page" n="301"/><milestone n="301a" unit="section"/>by a single ruler who rules with science&mdash;must never do anything in contravention of their existing written laws and ancestral customs.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>You are quite right.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Then whenever the rich imitate this government, we call such a state an aristocracy;  and when they disregard the laws, we call it an oligarchy.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Yes, I think we do.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And again, when one man rules according to laws
<milestone n="301b" unit="section"/>and imitates the scientific ruler, we call him a king, making no distinction in name between the single ruler who rules by science and him who rules by opinion if they both rule in accordance with laws.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Yes, I think we do.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Accordingly, if one man who is really scientific rules, he will assuredly be called by the same name, king, and by no other;  and so the five names of what are now called the forms of government have become only one.<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">What are called five distinct forms of government are resolved into one&mdash;the one right form of which all others are imitations (297 C).  This is to be sought in some small number or one person (ibid.).  We have found it in the really scientific monarchy, and the other so-called forms of government, being merely imitations of this, require no names of their own.</note></p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>So it seems, at least.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>But when a single ruler acts in accordance with neither laws nor customs, but claims,
<milestone n="301c" unit="section"/>in imitation of the scientific ruler, that whatever is best must be done, even though it be contrary to the written laws, and this imitation is inspired by desire and ignorance, is not such a ruler to be called in every instance a tyrant?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Thus, we say, the tyrant has arisen, and the king and oligarchy and aristocracy and democracy, because men are not contented with that one perfect ruler, and do not believe that there could ever be any one worthy of such power or
<milestone n="301d" unit="section"/>willing and able by ruling with virtue and knowledge to dispense justice and equity rightly to all, but that he will harm and kill and injure any one of us whom he chooses on any occasion, since they admit that if such a man as we describe should really arise, he would be welcomed and would continue to dwell among them, directing to their weal as sole ruler a perfectly right form of government.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>But, as the case now stands, since, as we claim, no king is produced in our states who is, like the ruler of the bees in their hives, by birth pre-eminently fitted from the beginning
<milestone n="301e" unit="section"/>in body and mind, we are obliged, as it seems, to follow in the track of the perfect and true form of government by coming together and making written laws.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Yes, I suppose we are.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Can we wonder, then, Socrates, at all the evils that arise and are destined to arise in such kinds of government, when they are based upon such a foundation, and must conduct their affairs in accordance with written laws and with customs, without knowledge?
<milestone unit="page" n="302"/><milestone n="302a" unit="section"/>For every one can see that any other art built upon such a foundation would ruin all its works that are so produced.  Ought we not rather to wonder at the stability that inheres in the state?  For states have labored under such conditions for countless ages, nevertheless some of them are lasting and are not overthrown.  Many, to be sure, like ships that founder at sea, are destroyed, have been destroyed, and will be destroyed hereafter, through the worthlessness of their captains and crews who have the greatest ignorance of the greatest things,
<milestone n="302b" unit="section"/>men who have no knowledge of statesmanship, but think they have in every respect most perfect knowledge of this above all other sciences.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Very true.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Is it, then, our duty to see which of these not right forms of government is the least difficult to live with, though all are difficult, and which is the most oppressive, although this is somewhat aside from the subject we had proposed for ourselves?  On the whole, however, perhaps all of us have some such motive in mind in all that we are doing.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Yes, it is our duty, of course.
<milestone n="302c" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Well then, you may say that of the three forms, the same is both the hardest and the easiest.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>What do you mean?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Just this:  I mean that there are three forms of government, as we said at the beginning of the discussion which has now flowed in upon us&mdash;monarchy, the rule of the few, and the rule of the many.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Yes, there were those three.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Let us, then, by dividing each of these into two parts, make six, and by distinguishing the right government from these, a seventh.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>How shall we make the division?
<milestone n="302d" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>We said that monarchy comprised royalty and tyranny, and the rule of the few comprised aristocracy, which has a name of good omen, and oligarchy;  but to the rule of the many we gave then only a single name, democracy;  now, however, that also must be divided.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>How?  On what principle shall we divide that?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>On the same that we used for the others, though the name of this form is already twofold in meaning.<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">The name is said to be twofold in meaning, probably because it was applied in cases in which there was a regularly constituted popular government and also in cases of mob rule.</note> At any rate, the distinction between ruling according to law
<milestone n="302e" unit="section"/>and without law applies alike to this and the rest.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Yes, it does.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Before, when we were in search of the right government, this division was of no use, as we showed at the time but now that we have set that apart and have decided that the others are the only available forms of government, the principle of lawfulness and lawlessness bisects each of them.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>So it seems, from what has been said.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Monarchy, then, when bound by good written rules, which we call laws, is the best of all the six;  but without law it is hard and most oppressive to live with.
<milestone unit="page" n="303"/><milestone n="303a" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>I fancy it is.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>But just as few is intermediate between one and a multitude, so the government of the few must be considered intermediate, both in good and in evil.  But the government of the multitude is weak in all respects and able to do nothing great, either good or bad, when compared with the other forms of government, because in this the powers of government are distributed in small shares among many men;  therefore of all these governments when they are lawful, this is the worst, and when they are all lawless it is the best;
<milestone n="303b" unit="section"/>and if they are all without restraint, life is most desirable in a democracy, but if they are orderly, that is the worst to live in;  but life in the first kind of state is by far the first and best, with the exception of the seventh, for that must be set apart from all the others, as God is set apart from men.<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">The concentration of power in the hands of one man makes monarchy most efficient, but, since no human monarch is perfect, monarchy must be regulated by laws.  Its efficiency makes it under such conditions the best government to live under.  But without restraint of law monarchy becomes tyranny&mdash;the worst kind of oppression.  Oligarchy occupies a position intermediate between monarchy and democracy&mdash;less efficient than the one and more efficient than the other, because power is distributed among a small number of persons&mdash;and is, therefore, when lawful less good, and when lawless less bad, than monarchy.  Democracy, in turn, since power is too greatly subdivided, is inefficient, either for good or evil, and is, therefore, when lawful less good, and when lawless less bad, than either of the others.</note></p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>That statement appears to be true to the facts, and we must do as you say.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Then those who participate in all those governments with the exception of the scientific one&mdash;are to be eliminated
<milestone n="303c" unit="section"/>as not being statesmen, but partisans and since they preside over the greatest counterfeits, they are themselves counterfeits, and since they are the greatest of imitators and cheats, they are the greatest of all sophists.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>This term &ldquo;sophist&rdquo; seems to have come round quite rightly to the so-called statesmen.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Well, this part has been exactly like a play.  Just as we remarked a moment ago,<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">291 A.</note> a festive troop of centaurs or satyrs was coming into view, which we had to separate from the art of statesmanship;
<milestone n="303d" unit="section"/>and now we have succeeded in doing this, though it has been very difficult.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>So it seems.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>But another group remains, which is still more difficult to separate, because it is more closely akin to the kingly class and is also harder to recognize.  I think we are in somewhat the same position as refiners of gold.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>How so?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Why, the refiners first remove earth and stones and all that sort of thing;
    <milestone n="303e" unit="section"/>and after that there remain the precious substances which are mixed with the gold and akin to it and can be removed only by fire&mdash;copper and silver and sometimes adamant.<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb"><bibl n="Plat. Tim. 59b">Plat. Tim. 59 B</bibl>, defines adamant as <foreign lang="greek">XRUSOU= O)/ZOS</foreign>&ldquo;a branch of gold.&rdquo;  It was, then, a substance akin to gold.  Platinum has been suggested.</note> These are removed by the difficult processes of smelting and tests, leaving before our eyes what is called unalloyed gold in all its purity.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Yes, that is said, at least, to be the process.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>By the same method I think all that is different and alien and incompatible has now been eliminated by us from the science of statesmanship, and what is precious and akin to it is left.  Herein are included the arts
<milestone unit="page" n="304"/><milestone n="304a" unit="section"/>of the general and of the judge and that kind of oratory which partakes of the kingly art because it persuades men to justice and thereby helps to steer the ship of state.  Now in what way shall we most easily eliminate these and show him whom we seek alone by himself and undisguised?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Clearly we must do this somehow.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Then if it is a question of trying, he will be shown.  But I think we had better try to disclose him by means of music.  Please answer my question.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>What is it?
<milestone n="304b" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Shall we agree that there is such a thing as learning music and the sciences of handicraft in general?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>There is.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And how about this?  Shall we say that there is another science connected with those, which tells whether we ought or ought not to learn any one of then?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Yes, we shall say that there is.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And shall we agree that this is different from those?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And shall we say that none of them ought to have control of any other,
<milestone n="304c" unit="section"/>or that those sciences should control this one, or that this should control and rule all the others?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>This should control those others.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>You mean that the science which decides whether we ought to learn or not should control the science which is learnt or teaches?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Emphatically.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And the science which decides whether to persuade or not should control that which can persuade?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Well, then, to what science shall we assign the power of persuading a multitude or a mob by telling edifying stories,
<milestone n="304d" unit="section"/>not by teaching?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>It is, I think, clear that this must be added to rhetoric.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>But the power of deciding whether some action, no matter what, should be taken, either by persuasion or by some exercise of force, in relation to any person, or whether to take no action at all&mdash;to what science is that to be assigned?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>To the science which controls the sciences of persuasion and speech.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And that would, I think, be no other than the function of the statesman.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>A most excellent conclusion.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>So rhetoric also seems to have been quickly separated from statesmanship<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">Cf. 303 C.</note>
<milestone n="304e" unit="section"/>as a different species, subservient to the other.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Here is another function or power; what are we to think about it?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>What is it?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>The power of determining how war shall be waged against those upon whom we have declared war, whether we are to call this a science or not a science?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>How could we think it is not a science, when generalship and all military activity practise it?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And the power which is able and knows how to deliberate and decide whether to make war or peace, shall we assume that it is the same as this or different?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>If we are consistent, we must assume that it is different.
<milestone unit="page" n="305"/><milestone n="305a" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Shall we, then, assume that it controls the other, if we are to agree with our views in the former examples?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And what other art shall we make bold to declare is mistress of that great and terrible art, the art of war as a whole, except the truly kingly art?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>No other.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>We shall, then, not call the art of the generals statesmanship, since it is subservient.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>No;  that would not be reasonable.
<milestone n="305b" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Now let us examine the function of the righteous judges.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Has it any power beyond that of judging menÕs contracts with one another, pronouncing them right or wrong by the standard of the existing laws which it has received from the king and law-giver;  showing its own peculiar virtue in that it is not so perverted by any bribes, or fears, or pity,

<milestone n="305c" unit="section"/>or enmity, or friendship, as ever to consent to decide the lawsuits of men with each other contrary to the enactments of the lawgiver?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>No;  the business of this power is about as you have described it.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Then we find that the strength of judges is not kingly, but is guardian of laws and a servant of the kingly power.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>So it appears.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>The consideration of all these arts which have been mentioned leads to the conclusion that none of them is the art of the statesman.  For the art that is truly kingly ought not to act itself,
<milestone n="305d" unit="section"/>but should rule over the arts that have the power of action;  it should decide upon the right or wrong time for the initiation of the most important measures in the state, and the other arts should perform its behests.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Right.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Therefore those arts which we have just described, as they control neither one another nor themselves, but have each its own peculiar sphere of action, are quite properly called by special names corresponding to those special actions.
<milestone n="305e" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>That appears, at least, to be the case.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>But the art which holds sway over them all and watches over the laws and all things in the state, weaving them all most perfectly together, we may, I think, by giving to its function a designation which indicates its power over the community, with full propriety call &ldquo;statecraft.&rdquo;</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Most assuredly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Shall we then proceed to discuss it after the model supplied by weaving,<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">See 287-290, 303-305.</note> now that all the classes in the state have been made plain to us?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>By all means.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Then the kingly process of weaving must be described,
<milestone unit="page" n="306"/><milestone n="306a" unit="section"/>its nature, the manner in which it combines the threads, and the kind of web it produces.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Evidently.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>It has, apparently, become necessary, after all, to explain a difficult matter.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>But certainly the explanation must be made.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>It is difficult, for the assertion that one part of virtue is in a way at variance with another sort of virtue may very easily be assailed by those who appeal to popular opinion in contentious arguments.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>I do not understand.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>I will say it again in another way.  I suppose you believe
<milestone n="306b" unit="section"/>that courage<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">The word <foreign lang="greek">A)NDREI/A</foreign> has a much wider meaning than the English &ldquo;courage.&rdquo;  Like the Latin &ldquo;virtus,&rdquo; it embraces all qualities which are desirable in a perfect man, especially the more active and positive virtues.  When applied to one particular kind of virtue it is applied to courage, but throughout this discussion it is used in the wider sense, for which there is no single English equivalent.</note> is one part of virtue.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And, of course, that self-restraint is different from courage, but is also a part of virtue of which courage is a part.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Now I must venture to utter a strange doctrine about them.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>What is it?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>That, in a way, they are in a condition of great hostility and opposition to each other in many beings.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>What do you mean?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Something quite unusual;  for, you know, all the parts of virtue
<milestone n="306c" unit="section"/>are usually said to be friendly to one another.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Now shall we pay careful attention and see whether this is so simple, or, quite the contrary, there is in some respects a variance between them and their kin?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Yes;  please tell how we shall investigate the question.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Among all the parts we must look for those which we call excellent but place in two opposite classes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Say more clearly what you mean.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Acuteness and quickness, whether in body or
<milestone n="306d" unit="section"/>soul or vocal utterance, whether they are real or exist in such likenesses as music and graphic art produce in imitation of them&mdash;have you never yourself praised one of them or heard them praised by others?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Yes, of course.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And do you remember in what way they praise them as occasion offers?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Not in the least.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>I wonder if I can express to you in words what I have in mind.
<milestone n="306e" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Why not?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>You seem to think that is an easy thing to do.  However, let us consider the matter as it appears in the opposite classes.  For example, when we admire, as we frequently do in many actions, quickness and energy and acuteness of mind or body or even of voice, we express our praise of them by one word, courage.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>How so?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>We say acute and courageous in the first instance, also quick and courageous, and energetic and courageous;  and when we apply this word as a common term applicable to all persons and actions of this class, we praise them.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Yes, we do.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>But do we not also praise
<milestone unit="page" n="307"/><milestone n="307a" unit="section"/>the gentle type of movement in many actions?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>We do, decidedly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And in doing so, do we not say the opposite of what we said about the other class?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>How is that?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>We are always saying &ldquo;How quiet!&rdquo;  and &ldquo;How restrained!&rdquo;  when we are admiring the workings of the mind, and again we speak of actions as slow and gentle, of the voice as smooth and deep, and of every rhythmic motion and of music in general as having appropriate slowness;
<milestone n="307b" unit="section"/>and we apply to them all the term which signifies, not courage, but decorum.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Very true.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And again, on the other hand, when these two classes seem to us out of place, we change our attitude and blame them each in turn;  then we use the terms in the opposite sense.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>How is that?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Why, whatsoever is sharper than the occasion warrants, or seems to be too quick or too hard, is called violent or mad, and whatever is too heavy or slow or gentle, is called cowardly and sluggish;
<milestone n="307c" unit="section"/>and almost always we find that the restraint of one class of qualities and the courage of the opposite class, like two parties arrayed in hostility to each other, do not mix with each other in the actions that are concerned with such qualities.  Moreover, if we pursue the inquiry, we shall see that the men who have these qualities in their souls are at variance with one another.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>In what do you mean that they are at variance?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>In all those points which we just mentioned,
<milestone n="307d" unit="section"/>and probably in many others.  For men who are akin to each class, I imagine, praise some qualities as their own and find fault with those of their opposites as alien to themselves, and thus great enmity arises between them on many grounds.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Yes, that is likely to be the case.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Now this opposition of these two classes is mere childÕs play but when it affects the most important matters it becomes a most detestable disease in the state.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>What matters does it affect?
<milestone n="307e" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>The whole course of life, in all probability.  For those who are especially decorous are ready to live always a quiet and retired life and to mind their own business;  this is the manner of their intercourse with every one at home, and they are equally ready at all times to keep peace in some way or other with foreign states.  And because of this desire of theirs, which is often inopportune and excessive, when they have their own way they quite unconsciously become unwarlike, and they make the young men unwarlike also;  they are at the mercy of aggressors;  and thus in a few years they
<milestone unit="page" n="308"/><milestone n="308a" unit="section"/>and their children and the whole state often pass by imperceptible degrees from freedom to slavery.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>That is a hard and terrible experience.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>But how about those who incline towards courage?  Do they not constantly urge their countries to war, because of their excessive desire for a warlike life?  Do they not involve them in hostilities with many powerful opponents and either utterly destroy their native lands or enslave and subject them to their foes?
<milestone n="308b" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Yes, that is true, too.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Then in these examples how can we deny that these two classes are always filled with the greatest hostility and opposition to one another?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>We certainly cannot deny it.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Have we not, then, found just what we had in view in the beginning, that important parts of virtue are by nature at variance with one another and also that the persons who possess them exhibit the same opposition?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Yes, I suppose that is true.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Let us then take up another question.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>What question?
<milestone n="308c" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Whether any constructive science voluntarily composes any, even the most worthless, of its works out of good and bad materials, or every science invariably rejects the bad, so far as possible, taking only the materials which are good and fitting, out of which, whether they be like or unlike, it gathers all elements together and produces one form or value.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>The latter, of course.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Then neither will the true natural art of statecraft
<milestone n="308d" unit="section"/>ever voluntarily compose a state of good and bad men;  but obviously it will first test them in play, and after the test will entrust them in turn to those who are able to teach and help them to attain the end in view;  it will itself give orders and exercise supervision, just as the art of weaving constantly commands and supervises

And those men who have no capacity for courage and self-restraint and the other qualities which tend towards virtue, but by the force of an evil nature are carried away into godlessness,

<milestone n="309b" unit="section"/>and of uniting with each other as art requires, the kingly art takes those natures which tend more towards courage, considering that their character is sturdier, like the warp in weaving, and those which incline towards decorum, for these, to continue the simile, are spun thick and soft like the threads of the woof, and tries to combine these natures of opposite tendencies and weave them together in the following manner.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>In what manner?
<milestone n="309c" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>First it binds the eternal part of their souls with a divine bond, to which that part is akin, and after the divine it binds the animal part of them with human bonds.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Again I ask What do you mean?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>I mean that really true and assured opinion about honor, justice, goodness and their opposites is divine, and when it arises in menÕs souls, it arises in a godlike race.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>That would be fitting, at any rate.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Do we not know, then, that the statesman and good lawgiver
<milestone n="309d" unit="section"/>is the only one to whom the power properly belongs, by the inspiration of the kingly art, to implant this true opinion in those who have rightly received education, those of whom we were just now speaking?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Well, probably.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And let us never, Socrates, call him who has not such power by the names we are now examining.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Quite right.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Now is not a courageous soul, when it lays hold upon such truth, made gentle,
<milestone n="309e" unit="section"/>and would it not then be most ready to partake of justice?  And without it, does it not incline more towards brutality?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Yes, of course.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>And again if the decorous nature partakes of these opinions, does it not become truly self-restrained and wise, so far as the state is concerned, and if it lacks participation in such qualities, does it not very justly receive the shameful epithet of simpleton?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Then can we say that such interweaving and binding together of the bad with the bad or of the good with the bad ever becomes enduring, or that any science would ever seriously make use of it in uniting such persons?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Of course not.
<milestone unit="page" n="310"/><milestone n="310a" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>But we may say that in those only who were of noble nature from their birth and have been nurtured as befits such natures it is implanted by the laws, and for them this is the medicine prescribed by science, and, as we said before, this bond which unites unlike and divergent parts of virtue is more divine.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Very true.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>The remaining bonds, moreover, being human, are not very difficult to devise or, after one has devised them, to create, when once this divine bond exists.
<milestone n="310b" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>How so?  And what are the bonds?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Those made between states concerning intermarriages and the sharing of children by adoption,<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">More or less equivalent to naturalization.  It apparently means the adoption into one state of children born to citizens of another.  This was not, as a rule, practiced in the Greek city states, but Plato here seems to recommend it.</note> and those relating to portionings and marriages within the state.  For most people make such bonds without proper regard to the procreation of children.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>How is that?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>The pursuit of wealth or power in connection with matrimony&mdash;but why should anyone ever take the trouble to blame it, as though it were worth arguing about?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>There is no reason for doing so.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>We have better cause, however, to speak our minds about those
<milestone n="310c" unit="section"/>whose chief care is the family, in case their conduct is not what it should be.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Yes;  very likely.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>The fact is, they act on no right theory at all;  they seek their ease for the moment;  welcoming gladly those who are like themselves, and finding those who are unlike them unendurable, they give the greatest weight to their feeling of dislike.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>How so?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>The decorous people seek for characters like their own;  so far as they can they marry wives of that sort and in turn give their daughters in marriage to men of that sort;
<milestone n="310d" unit="section"/>and the courageous do the same, eagerly seeking natures of their own kind, whereas both classes ought to do quite the opposite.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>How so, and why?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>Because in the nature of things courage, if propagated through many generations with no admixture of a self-restrained nature, though at first it is strong and flourishing, in the end blossoms forth in utter madness.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>That is likely.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>But the soul, on the other hand, that is too full of modesty and contains no alloy of courage or boldness,
<milestone n="310e" unit="section"/>after many generations of the same kind becomes too sluggish and finally is utterly crippled.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>That also is likely to happen.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>It was these bonds, then, that I said there was no difficulty in creating, provided that both classes have one and the same opinion about the honorable and the good.  For indeed the whole business of the kingly weaving is comprised in this and this alone,&mdash;in never allowing the self-restrained characters to be separated from the courageous, but in weaving them together by common beliefs and honors and dishonors and opinions and interchanges of pledges, thus making of them a smooth and, as we say, well-woven fabric,
<milestone unit="page" n="311"/><milestone n="311a" unit="section"/>and then entrusting to them in common for ever the offices of the state.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>How is that to be done?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>When one official is needed, by choosing a president who possesses both qualities;  and when a hoard is desired, by combining men of each class.  For the characters of self-restrained officials are exceedingly careful and just and conservative, but they lack keenness and a certain quick and active boldness.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>That also seems, at least, to be true.
<milestone n="311b" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>The courageous natures, on the other hand, are deficient in justice and caution in comparison with the former, but excel in boldness of action;  and unless both these qualities are present it is impossible for a state to be entirely prosperous in public and private matters.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>Yes, certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Stranger</speaker><p>This, then, is the end, let us declare, of the web of the statesmanÕs activity, the direct interweaving of the characters of restrained and courageous men,

<milestone n="311c" unit="section"/>when the kingly science has drawn them together by friendship and community of sentiment into a common life, and having perfected the most glorious and the best of all textures, clothes with it all the inhabitants of the state, both slaves and freemen, holds them together by this fabric, and omitting nothing which ought to belong to a happy state, rules and watches over them.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Younger Socrates</speaker><p>You have given us, Stranger, a most complete and admirable treatment of the king and the statesman.</p></sp></body></text></group></text></TEI.2>
