<milestone unit="page" n="103"/><milestone unit="section" n="103a"/><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Son of Cleinias, I think it must surprise you that I, the first of all your lovers, am the only one of them who has not given up his suit and thrown you over, and whereas they have all pestered you with their conversation I have not spoken one word to you for so many years.  The cause of this has been nothing human, but a certain spiritual opposition,<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">Socrates refers to the &ldquo;spiritual sign&rdquo; which occasionally warned him against an intended action:  cf. <bibl n="Plat. Apol. 31c">Plat. Apol. 31c-d</bibl>, <bibl n="Plat. Apol. 40a">Plat. Apol. 40a-b</bibl>.</note> of whose power you shall be informed at some later time.  However, it now opposes me no longer,
<milestone unit="section" n="103b"/>so I have accordingly come to you;  and I am in good hopes that it will not oppose me again in the future.  Now I have been observing you all this time, and have formed a pretty good notion of your behavior to your lovers:  for although they were many and high-spirited, everyone of them has found your spirit too strong for him and has run away. 
<milestone unit="page" n="104"/><milestone unit="section" n="104a"/>Let me explain the reason of your spirit being too much for them.  You say you have no need of any man in any matter;  for your resources are so great, beginning with the body and ending with the soul, that you lack nothing.  You think, in the first place, that you are foremost in beauty and stature&mdash;and you are not mistaken in this, as is plain for all to see&mdash;and in the second place, that you are of the most gallant family in your city, the greatest city in <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>, and
<milestone unit="section" n="104b"/>that there you have, through your father, very many of the best people as your friends and kinsmen, who would assist you in case of need, and other connections also, through your mother, who are not a whit inferior to these, nor fewer.  And you reckon upon a stronger power than all those that I have mentioned, in Pericles, son of Xanthippus, whom your father left as guardian of you and your brother when he died, and who is able to do whatever he likes not only in this city but all over <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName> and among many great nations of the barbarians. 
<milestone unit="section" n="104c"/>And I will add besides the wealth of your house:  but on this, I observe, you presume least of all.  Well, you puff yourself up on all these advantages, and have overcome your lovers, while they in their inferiority have yielded to your might, and all this has not escaped you;  so I am very sure that you wonder what on earth I mean by not getting rid of my passion, and what can be my hope in remaining when the rest have fled.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Perhaps also, Socrates, you are not aware that
<milestone unit="section" n="104d"/>you have only just anticipated me.  For I, in fact, had the intention of coming and asking you first that very same question&mdash;what is your aim and expectation in bothering me by making a particular point of always turning up wherever I may be.  For I really do wonder what can be your object, and should be very glad if you would tell me.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then you will listen to me, presumably, with keen attention if, as you say, you long to know what I mean, and I have in you a listener who will stay to hear me out.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Why, to be sure:  only speak.
<milestone unit="section" n="104e"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Look to it, then;  for it would be no wonder if I should make as much difficulty about stopping as I have made about starting.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>My good sir, speak;  for I will listen.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Speak I must, I suppose.  Now, although it is hard for a lover to parley with a man who does not yield to lovers, I must make bold nevertheless to put my meaning into words.  For if I saw you, Alcibiades, content with the things I set forth just now, and minded to pass your life in enjoying them, I should long ago have put away my love,
<milestone unit="page" n="105"/><milestone unit="section" n="105a"/>so at least I persuade myself:  but as it is, I shall propound to your face quite another set of your thoughts, whereby you will understand that I have had you continually before my mind.  For I believe, if some god should ask you:  &ldquo;Alcibiades, do you prefer to live with your present possessions, or to die immediately if you are not to have the chance of acquiring greater things?&rdquo;  I believe you would choose to die.  But let me tell you what I imagine must be the present hope of your life.  You think that if you come shortly before the Athenian Assembly&mdash;which
<milestone unit="section" n="105b"/>you expect to occur in a very few days&mdash;you will stand forth and prove to the people that you are more worthy of honor than either Pericles or anyone else who has ever existed, and that having proved this you will have the greatest power in the state;  and that if you are the greatest here, you will be the same among all the other Greeks, and not only Greeks, but all the barbarians who inhabit the same continent with us.  And if that same god should say to you again, that you are to hold sway here in <placeName key="tgn,1000003">Europe</placeName>,
<milestone unit="section" n="105c"/>but are not to be allowed to cross over into <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName> and to interfere with the affairs of that region, I believe you would be equally loth to live on those sole conditions either&mdash;if you are not to fill, one may say, the whole world with your name and your power;  and I fancy that, except Cyrus and Xerxes, you think there has never existed a single man who was of any account.  So then that this is your hope, I know well enough;  I am not merely guessing.  And I daresay you will reply, since you know that what I say is true:  &ldquo;Well,
<milestone unit="section" n="105d"/>Socrates, and what has that to do with your point?&rdquo;  I am going to tell you, dear son of Cleinias and Deinomache.  Without me it is impossible for all those designs of yours to be crowned with achievement;  so great is the power I conceive myself to have over your affairs and over you, and it is for this very reason, I believe, that the god has so long prevented me from talking with you, and I was waiting to see when he would allow me.  For as
<milestone unit="section" n="105e"/>you have hopes of proving yourself in public to be invaluable to the state and, having proved it, of winning forthwith unlimited power, so do I hope to win supreme power over you by proving that I am invaluable to you, and that neither guardian nor kinsman nor anyone else is competent to transmit to you the power that you long for except me, with the god's help, however.  In your younger days, to be sure, before you had built such high hopes, the god, as I believe, prevented me from talking with you, in order that I might not waste my words:  but now he has set me on; 
<milestone unit="page" n="106"/><milestone unit="section" n="106a"/>for now you will listen to me.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>You seem to me far more extraordinary, Socrates, now that you have begun to speak, than before, when you followed me about in silence;  though even then you looked strange enough.  Well, as to my intending all this or not, you have apparently made your decision, and any denial of mine will not avail me to persuade you.  Very good:  but supposing I have intended ever so much what you say, how are you the sole means through which I can hope to attain it?  Can you tell me?
<milestone unit="section" n="106b"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Are you asking whether I can make a long speech, such as you are used to hearing?  No, my gift is not of that sort.  But I fancy I could prove to you that the case is so, if you will consent to do me just one little service.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Why, if you mean a service that is not troublesome, I consent.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Do you consider it troublesome to answer questions put to you?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>No, I do not.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then answer.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Ask.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Well, you have the intentions
<milestone unit="section" n="106c"/>which I say you have, I suppose?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Be it so, if you like, in order that I may know what you will say next.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Now then:  you intend, as I say, to come forward as adviser to the Athenians in no great space of time;  well, suppose I were to take hold of you as you were about to ascend the platform, and were to ask you:  &ldquo;Alcibiades, on what subject do the Athenians propose to take advice, that you should stand up to advise them?  Is it something about which you have better knowledge than they?&rdquo;  What would be your reply?
<milestone unit="section" n="106d"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>I should say, I suppose, it was something about which I knew better than they.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then you are a good adviser on things about which you actually know.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>To be sure.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And you know only the things you have learnt from others or discovered yourself?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>What could I know besides?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And can it be that you would ever have learnt or discovered anything without being willing either to learn it or to inquire into it yourself?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>No.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Well then, would you have been willing to inquire into or learn what you thought you knew?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>No, indeed.
<milestone unit="section" n="106e"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>So there was a time when you did not think that you knew what you now actually know.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>There must have been.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Well, but I know pretty nearly the things that you have learnt:  tell me if anything has escaped me.  You learnt, if I recollect, writing and harping and wrestling;  as for fluting, you refused to learn it.  These are the things that you know, unless perhaps there is something you have been learning unobserved by me;  and this you were not, I believe, if you so much as stepped out of doors either by night or by day.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>No, I have taken no other lessons than those.
<milestone unit="page" n="107"/><milestone unit="section" n="107a"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then tell me, will it be when the Athenians are taking advice how they are to do their writing correctly that you are to stand up and advise them?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Upon my word, not I.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Well, about strokes on the lyre?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Not at all.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Nor in fact are they accustomed to deliberate on throws in wrestling either at the Assembly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>No, to be sure.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then what will be the subject of the advice?  For I presume it will not be about building.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>No, indeed.
<milestone unit="section" n="107b"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>For a builder will give better advice than you in that matter.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Nor yet will it be about divination?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>No.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>For there again a diviner will serve better than you.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Whether he be short or tall, handsome or ugly, nay, noble or ignoble.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Of course.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>For on each subject the advice comes from one who knows, not one who has riches.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Of course.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And whether their mentor be poor or rich will make no difference to the Athenians when they deliberate
<milestone unit="section" n="107c"/>for the health of the citizens;  all that they require of their counsellor is that he be a physician.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Naturally.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then what will they have under consideration if you are to be right in standing up, when you do so, as their counsellor?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Their own affairs, Socrates.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Do you mean with regard to shipbuilding, and the question as to what sort of ships they ought to get built?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>No, I do not, Socrates.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Because, I imagine, you do not understand shipbuilding.  Is that, and that alone, the reason?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>That is just the reason.
<milestone unit="section" n="107d"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Well, on what sort of affairs of their own do you mean that they will be deliberating?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>On war, Socrates, or on peace, or on any other of the state's affairs.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Do you mean that they will be deliberating with whom they ought to make peace, and on whom they ought to make war, and in what manner?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And on whom it is better to do so, ought they not?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Yes.
<milestone unit="section" n="107e"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And at such time as it is better?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And for so long as they had better?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Now if the Athenians should deliberate with whom they should wrestle close, and with whom only at arm's length, and in what manner, would you or the wrestling-master be the better adviser?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>The wrestling-master, I presume.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And can you tell me what the wrestling-master would have in view when he advised as to the persons with whom they ought or ought not to wrestle close, and when and in what manner?  What I mean is something like this:  ought they not to wrestle close with those with whom it is better to do so?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Yes.
<milestone unit="page" n="108"/><milestone unit="section" n="108a"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And so far as is better, too?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>So far.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And at such time also as is better?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>But again, when one sings, one has sometimes to accompany the song with harping and stepping?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Yes, one has.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And at such time as is better?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And so far as is better?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>I agree.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Well now, since you applied the term &ldquo;better&rdquo; to the two cases
<milestone unit="section" n="108b"/>of harping for accompaniment of a song and close wrestling, what do you call the &ldquo;better&rdquo; in the case of harping, to correspond with what in the case of wrestling I call gymnastic?  What do you call the other?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>I do not understand.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Well, try to copy me:  for my answer gave you, I think, what is correct in every instance;  and that is correct, I presume, which proceeds by rule of the art, is it not?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And was not the art here gymnastic?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>To be sure.
<milestone unit="section" n="108c"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And I said that the better<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">Socrates means by &ldquo;better&rdquo; or &ldquo;the better way&rdquo; the general method of attaining excellence in any art.</note> in the case of wrestling was gymnastic.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>You did.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And I was quite fair?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>I think so.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Come then, in your turn&mdash;for it would befit you also, I fancy, to argue fairly<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">Socrates here repeats <foreign lang="greek">kalw=s</foreign> (which means &ldquo;handsomely&rdquo; as well as &ldquo;correctly&rdquo;) in allusion to Alcibiades' good looks.  Cf. <bibl n="Plat. Alc. 1.113b">Plat. Alc.1 113b</bibl></note>&mdash;tell me, first, what is the art which includes harping and singing and treading the measure correctly?  What is it called as a whole?  You cannot yet tell me?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>No, indeed.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Well, try another way:  who are the goddesses that foster the art?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>The Muses, you mean, Socrates?
<milestone unit="section" n="108d"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>I do.  Now, just think, and say by what name the art is called after them.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Music,<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">&ldquo;Music&rdquo; with the Greeks included poetry and dancing as well as our &ldquo;music.&rdquo;</note> I suppose you mean.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Yes, I do.  And what is that which proceeds correctly by its rule?  As in the other case I was correct in mentioning to you gymnastic as that which goes by the art, so I ask you, accordingly, what you say in this case.  What manner of proceeding is required?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>A musical one, I suppose.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>You are right.  Come then, what is it that you term &ldquo;better,&rdquo; in respect of what is better in waging war and being at peace? 
<milestone unit="section" n="108e"/>Just as in our other instances you said that the &ldquo;better&rdquo; implied the more musical and again, in the parallel case, the more gymnastical, try now if you can tell me what is the &ldquo;better&rdquo; in this case.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>But I am quite unable.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>But surely that is disgraceful;  for if you should speak to somebody as his adviser on food, and say that one sort was better than another, at this time and in this quantity, and he then asked you&mdash;What do you mean by the &ldquo;better,&rdquo; Alcibiades?&mdash;in a matter like that you could tell him you meant the more wholesome, although you do not set up to be a physician;  yet in a case where you set up
<milestone unit="page" n="109"/><milestone unit="section" n="109a"/>to have knowledge and are ready to stand up and advise as though you knew, are you not ashamed to be unable, as appears, to answer a question upon it?  Does it not seem disgraceful?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Very.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then consider and do your best to tell me the connection of &ldquo;better&rdquo; in being at peace or at war with those to whom we ought to be so disposed.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Well, I am considering, but I fail to perceive it.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>But you must know what treatment it is that we allege against each other when we enter upon a war,
<milestone unit="section" n="109b"/>and what name we give it when we do so?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>I do:  we say we are victims of deceit or violence or spoliation.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Enough:  how do we suffer each of these things?  Try and tell me what difference there is between one way and another.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Do you mean by that, Socrates, whether it is in a just way or an unjust way?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Precisely.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Why, there you have all the difference in the world.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Well then, on which sort are you going to advise the Athenians to make war&mdash;those who are acting unjustly, or those who are doing what is just?
<milestone unit="section" n="109c"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>That is a hard question:  for even if someone decides that he must go to war with those who are doing what is just, he would not admit that they were doing so.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>For that would not be lawful, I suppose?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>No, indeed;  nor is it considered honorable either.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>So you too will appeal to these things in making your speeches?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Necessarily.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then must not that &ldquo;better&rdquo; about which I was asking in reference to making or not making war, on those on whom we ought to or not, and when we ought to or not, be simply and solely the juster?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Apparently it is.
<milestone unit="section" n="109d"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>How now, friend Alcibiades?  Have you overlooked your own ignorance of this matter, or have I overlooked<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">Cf. above, <bibl n="Plat. Alc. 1.106e">Plat. Alc.1 106e</bibl>.</note> your learning it and taking lessons of a master who taught you to distinguish the more just and the more unjust?  And who is he?  Inform me in my turn, in order that you may introduce me to him as another pupil.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>You are joking, Socrates.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>No, I swear by our common God of Friendship, whose name
<milestone unit="section" n="109e"/>I would by no means take in vain.  Come, if you can, tell me who the man is.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>But what if I cannot?  Do you think I could not know about what is just and unjust in any other way?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Yes, you might, supposing you discovered it.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>But do you not think I might discover it?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Yes, quite so, if you inquired.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>And do you not think I might inquire?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>I do, if you thought you did not know.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>And was there not a time when I held that view?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Well spoken.  Then can you tell me at what time it was
<milestone unit="page" n="110"/><milestone unit="section" n="110a"/>that you thought you did not know what is just and unjust?  Pray, was it a year ago that you were inquiring, and thought you did not know?  Or did you think you knew?  Please answer truly, that our debates may not be futile.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Well, I thought I knew.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And two years, and three years, and four years back, were you not of the same mind?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>I was.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>But, you see, before that time you were a child, were you not?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>So I know well enough that then you thought you knew.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>How do you know it so well?
<milestone unit="section" n="110b"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Many a time I heard you, when as a child you were dicing or playing some other game at your teacher's or elsewhere, instead of showing hesitation about what was just and unjust, speak in very loud and confident tones about one or other of your playmates, saying he was a rascal and a cheat who played unfairly.  Is not this a true account?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>But what was I to do, Socrates, when somebody cheated me?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Yet if you were ignorant then whether you were being unfairly treated or not, how can you ask&mdash;&ldquo;What are you to do?&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="110c"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Well, but on my word, I was not ignorant:  no, I clearly understood that I was being wronged.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>So you thought you knew, even as a child, it seems, what was just and unjust.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>I did;  and I knew too.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>At what sort of time did you discover it?  For surely it was not while you thought you knew.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>No, indeed.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then when did you think you were ignorant?  Consider;  I believe you will fail to find such a time.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Upon my word, Socrates, I really cannot say.
<milestone unit="section" n="110d"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>So you do not know it by discovery.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Not at all, apparently.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>But you said just now that you did not know it by learning either;  and if you neither discovered nor learnt it, how do you come to know it, and whence?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Well, perhaps that answer I gave you was not correct, that I knew it by my own discovery.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then how was it done?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>I learnt it, I suppose, in the same way as everyone else.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Back we come to the same argument.  From whom?  Please tell me.
<milestone unit="section" n="110e"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>From the many.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>They are no very serious teachers with whom you take refuge, if you ascribe it to the many!</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Why, are they not competent to teach?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Not how to play, or not to play, draughts;  and yet that, I imagine, is a slight matter compared with justice.  What?  Do you not think so?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then if they are unable to teach the slighter, can they teach the more serious matter?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>I think so:  at any rate, there are many other things that they are able to teach, more serious than draughts.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>What sort of things?
<milestone unit="page" n="111"/><milestone unit="section" n="111a"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>For instance, it was from them that I learnt to speak Greek, and I could not say who was my teacher, but can only ascribe it to the same people who, you say, are not serious teachers.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Ah, gallant sir, the many may be good teachers of that, and they can justly be praised for their teaching of such subjects.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>And why?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Because in those subjects they have the equipment proper to good teachers.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>What do you mean by that?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>You know that those who are going to teach anything should first know it themselves, do you not?
<milestone unit="section" n="111b"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Of course.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And that those who know should agree with each other and not differ?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>But if they differ upon anything, will you say that they know it?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>No, indeed.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then how can they be teachers of it?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>By no means.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Well now, do you find that the many differ about the nature of stone or wood?  If you ask one of them,
<milestone unit="section" n="111c"/>do they not agree on the same answer, and make for the same things when they want to get a piece of stone or wood?  It is just the same, too, with everything of the sort:  for I am pretty nearly right in understanding you to mean just this by knowing how to speak Greek, am I not?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And on these matters, as we stated, they not only agree with each other and with themselves in private, but states also use in public the same terms about them to each other, without any dispute?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>They do.
<milestone unit="section" n="111d"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then naturally they will be good teachers of these matters.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And if we should wish to provide anyone with knowledge of them, we should be right in sending him to be taught by &ldquo;the many&rdquo; that you speak of?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>But what if we wished to know not only what men were like or what horses were like, but which of them were good runners or not?  Would the many still suffice to teach us this?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>No, indeed.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And you have ample proof that they do not know this,
<milestone unit="section" n="111e"/>and are not proficient teachers of it, in their not agreeing about it at all with themselves?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>I have.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And what if we wished to know not only what men were like, but what healthy or diseased men were like?  Would the many suffice to teach us?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>No, indeed.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And you would have proof of their being bad teachers of that, if you saw them differing about it?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>I should.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Well then, do you now find that the many agree with themselves or each other
<milestone unit="page" n="112"/><milestone unit="section" n="112a"/>about just and unjust men or things?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Far from it, on my word, Socrates.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>In fact, they differ most especially on these points?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Very much so.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And I suppose you never yet saw or heard of people differing so sharply on questions of health or the opposite as to fight and kill one another in battle because of them.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>No, indeed.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>But on questions of justice or injustice I am sure you have; 
<milestone unit="section" n="112b"/>and if you have not seen them, at any rate you have heard of them from many people, especially Homer.

<milestone unit="section" n="112c"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>That is true.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And I imagine that when the Athenians and Spartans and Boeotians lost their men at <placeName key="perseus,Tanagra">Tanagra</placeName>,<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">457 B.C.</note> and later at <placeName key="tgn,7011235">Coronea</placeName>,<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">447 B.C.</note> among whom your own father perished, the difference that caused their deaths and fights was solely on a question of just and unjust, was it not?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>That is true.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then are we to say that these people understand those questions, on which
<milestone unit="section" n="112d"/>they differ so sharply that they are led by their mutual disputes to take these extreme measures against each other?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Apparently not.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And you refer me to teachers of that sort, whom you admit yourself to be without knowledge?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>It seems I do.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then how is it likely that you should know what is just and unjust, when you are so bewildered about these matters and are shown to have neither learnt them from anyone nor discovered them for yourself?.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>By what you say, it is not likely.
<milestone unit="section" n="112e"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>There again, Alcibiades, do you see how unfairly you speak?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>In what ?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>In stating that I say so.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Why, do you not say that l do not know about the just and unjust?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Not at all.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Well, do I say it?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>How, pray ?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>I will show you, in the following way.

<milestone unit="page" n="113"/><milestone unit="section" n="113a"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then is it I, the questioner, or you the answerer, that are found to be speaking about these things?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>I.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And what if I ask what are the letters in &ldquo;Socrates,&rdquo; and you tell me?

<milestone unit="section" n="113b"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And throughout the argument so far, I was the questioner?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And you the answerer?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Quite so.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Well then, which of us has spoken what has been said?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Apparently, Socrates, from what we have admitted, it was I.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And it was said that Alcibiades, the fair son of Cleinias, did not know about just and unjust, but thought he did, and intended to go to the Assembly as adviser to the Athenians on what he knows nothing about;  is not that so?
    <milestone unit="section" n="113c"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Apparently.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then, to quote Euripides,<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb"><bibl n="Eur.

<milestone unit="section" n="113d"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>I think, Socrates, that the Athenians and the rest of the Greeks rarely deliberate as to which is the more just or unjust course:  for they regard questions of this sort as obvious;  and so they pass them over and consider which course will prove more expedient in the result.  For the just and the expedient, I take it, are not the same, but many people have profited by great wrongs that they have committed, whilst others, I imagine, have had no advantage from doing what was right.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>What then?  Granting that the just and the expedient
<milestone unit="section" n="113e"/>are in fact as different as they can be, you surely do not still suppose you know what is expedient for mankind, and why it is so?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Well, what is the obstacle, Socrates,&mdash;unless you are going to ask me again from whom I learnt it, or how I discovered it for myself?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>What a way of going on!  If your answer is incorrect, and a previous argument can be used to prove it so, you claim to be told something new, and a different line of proof, as though the previous one were like a poor worn-out coat which you refuse to wear any longer;  you must be provided instead with something clean and unsoiled in the way of evidence. 
<milestone unit="page" n="114"/><milestone unit="section" n="114a"/>But I shall ignore your sallies in debate, and shall none the less ask you once more, where you learnt your knowledge of what is expedient, and who is your teacher, asking in one question all the things I asked before;  and now you will clearly find yourself in the same plight, and will be unable to prove that you know the expedient either through discovery or through learning.  But as you are dainty, and would dislike a repeated taste of the same argument, I pass over this question of whether you know or do not know
<milestone unit="section" n="114b"/>what is expedient for the Athenians:  but why have you not made it clear whether the just and the expedient are the same or different?  If you like, question me as I did you, or if you prefer, argue out the matter in your own way.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>But I am not sure I should be able, Socrates, to set it forth to you.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Well, my good sir, imagine I am the people in Assembly;  even there, you know, you will have to persuade each man singly, will you not?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And the same man may well persuade one person singly,
<milestone unit="section" n="114c"/>and many together, about things that he knows, just as the schoolmaster, I suppose, persuades either one or many about letters?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And again, will not the same man persuade either one or many about number?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And this will be the man who knows&mdash;the arithmetician?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Quite so.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And you too can persuade a single man about things of which you can persuade many?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Presumably.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And these are clearly things that you know.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And the only difference between the orator
<milestone unit="section" n="114d"/>speaking before the people and one who speaks in a conversation like ours is that the former persuades men in a number together of the same things, and the latter persuades them one at a time?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>It looks like it.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Come now, since we see that the same man may persuade either many or one, try your unpracticed hand on me, and endeavor to show that the just is sometimes not expedient.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>You are insolent, Socrates!</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>This time, at any rate, I am going to have the insolence to persuade you of the opposite of that which you decline to prove to me.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Speak, then.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Just answer my questions.
<milestone unit="section" n="114e"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>No, you yourself must be the speaker.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>What?

<milestone unit="page" n="115"/><milestone unit="section" n="115a"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>You are quite a prophet!  Now tell me, do you consider some just things to be expedient, and others not?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And again, some noble, and some not?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>What do you mean by that question?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>I would ask whether anyone ever seemed to you to be doing what was base and yet just.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Never.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Well, are all just things noble?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And what of noble things, in their turn?  Are they all good, or some only, while others are not?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>In my opinion, Socrates, some noble things are evil.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And some base things are good?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Yes.
<milestone unit="section" n="115b"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Do you mean as in one of the many cases where men have gone to rescue a comrade or kinsman in battle, and have been either wounded or killed, while those who did not go to the rescue, as duty bade, have got off safe and sound?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Precisely.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And such a rescue you call noble, in respect of the endeavor to save those whom it was one's duty to save;  and this is courage, is it not?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>But you call it evil, in respect of the deaths and wounds?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Yes.
<milestone unit="section" n="115c"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And is not the courage one thing, and the death another?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then it is not in the same respect that rescuing one's friends is noble and evil?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Apparently not.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then see if, inasmuch as it is noble, it is also good;  for in the present case you were admitting that the rescue was noble in respect of its courage:  now consider this very thing, courage, and say whether it is good or bad.  Consider it in this way:  which would you choose to have, good things or evil?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Good.
<milestone unit="section" n="115d"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And most of all, the greatest goods, and of such things you would least allow yourself to be deprived?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>To be sure.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then what do you say of courage?  At what price would you allow yourself to be deprived of it?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>I would give up life itself if I had to be a coward.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then you regard cowardice as the uttermost evil.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>I do.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>On a par with death, it seems.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And life and courage are the extreme opposites of death and cowardice?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Yes.
<milestone unit="section" n="115e"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And you would most desire to have the former, and least the latter?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Is that because you think the former best, and the latter worst?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>To be sure.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>So you reckon courage among the best things, and death among the worst.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>I do.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then the rescue of one's friends in battle, inasmuch as it is noble in respect of the working of good by courage, you have termed noble?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Apparently.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>But evil, in respect of the working of evil by death?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>So we may fairly describe each of these workings as follows:  as you call either of them evil because of the evil it produces,
<milestone unit="page" n="116"/><milestone unit="section" n="116a"/>so you must call it good because of the good it produces.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>I believe that is so.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And again, are they noble inasmuch as they are good, and base inasmuch as they are evil?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then in saying that the rescue of one's friends in battle is noble and yet evil, you mean just the same as if you called the rescue good, but evil.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>I believe what you say is true, Socrates.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>So nothing noble, in so far as it is noble, is evil, and nothing base, in so far as it is base, is good.
<milestone unit="section" n="116b"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Apparently.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Now then, consider it again in this way:  whoever does nobly, does well too, does he not?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And are not those who do well happy?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Of course.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And they are happy because of the acquisition of good things?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And they acquire these by doing well and nobly?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>So doing well is good?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Of course.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And welfare is noble?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Yes.
<milestone unit="section" n="116c"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Hence we have seen again that noble and good are the same thing.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Apparently.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then whatever we find to be noble we shall find also to be good, by this argument at least.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>We must.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Well then, are good things expedient or not?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Expedient.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And do you remember what our admissions were about just things?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>I think we said that those who do just things must do noble things.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And that those who do noble things must do good things?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Yes.

I shrink indeed from giving it a name, but still, as we are alone, let me speak out.  You are wedded to stupidity, my fine friend, of the vilest kind;  you are impeached of this by your own words, out of your own mouth;  and this, it seems, is why you dash into politics before you have been educated.

<milestone unit="section" n="120d"/>if you feared them and thought them terrible, or if you did not?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Clearly, if I thought them terrible.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And do you think you will come to any harm by taking pains over yourself?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>By no means;  rather that I shall get much benefit.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And on this single count that notion<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">i.e.  about the Spartan generals and the Persian king, <bibl n="Plat. Alc. 1.120c">Plat. Alc.1 120c</bibl>.</note> of yours is so much to the bad.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>True.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then, in the second place, observe the probability that it is false.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>How so?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Is it probable that noble races should produce
<milestone unit="section" n="120e"/>better natures, or not?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Clearly, noble races would.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And will not the well-born, provided they are well brought up, probably be perfected in virtue?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>That must be so.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then let us consider, by comparing our lot with theirs, whether the Spartan and Persian kings appear to be of inferior birth.  Do we not know that the former are descendants of Hercules and the latter of Achaemenes, and that the line of Hercules and the line of Achaemenes go back to Perseus, son of Zeus?
<milestone unit="page" n="121"/><milestone unit="section" n="121a"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Yes, and mine, Socrates, to Eurysaces, and that of Eurysaces to Zeus!</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Yes, and mine, noble Alcibiades, to Daedalus,<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">Socrates' father, Sophroniscus, was a sculptor, and Daedalus was the legendary inventor of sculpture.</note> and Daedalus to Hephaestus, son of Zeus!  But take the lines of those people,<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">i.e., the kings of <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,7000231">Persia</placeName>.</note> going back from them:  you have a succession of kings reaching to Zeus&mdash;on the one hand, kings of <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName> and <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>;  on the other, of <placeName key="tgn,7000231">Persia</placeName>, which they have always ruled, and frequently <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName> also, as at present;  whereas we are private persons ourselves, and so were our fathers.  And then,
<milestone unit="section" n="121b"/>suppose that you had to make what show you could of your ancestors, and of <placeName key="tgn,7002340">Salamis</placeName> as the native land of Eurysaces, or of <placeName key="tgn,7011087">Aegina</placeName> as the home of the yet earlier Aeacus, to impress Artaxerxes, son of Xerxes, how you must expect to be laughed at!  Why, I am afraid we are quite outdone by those persons in pride of birth and upbringing altogether.  Or have you not observed how great are the advantages of the Spartan kings, and how their wives are kept under statutory ward of the ephors, in order that every possible precaution may be taken against the king being born
<milestone unit="section" n="121c"/>of any but the Heracleidae?  And the Persian king so far surpasses us that no one has a suspicion that he could have been born of anybody but the king before him;  and hence the king's wife has nothing to guard her except fear.  When the eldest son, the heir to the throne, is born, first of all the king's subjects who are in his palace have a feast, and then for ever after on that date the whole of <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName> celebrates the king's birthday with sacrifice and feasting:  but when we are born, as the comic poet<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">The saying, which became proverbial, is thought to have occurred in one of the (now lost) plays of Plato, the Athenian comic poet, who lived c. <dateRange from="-460" to="-389">460</dateRange>-389 B.C.</note> says,
<milestone unit="section" n="121d"/><cit><quote type="verse">even the neighbors barely notice it,</quote><bibl>Plato Comicus?</bibl></cit> Alcibiades.  After that comes the nurture of the child, not at the hands of a woman-nurse of little worth, but of the most highly approved eunuchs in the king's service, who are charged with the whole tendance of the new-born child, and especially with the business of making him as handsome as possible by moulding his limbs into a correct shape;  and while doing this they are in high honor. 
<milestone unit="section" n="121e"/>When the boys are seven years old they are given horses and have riding lessons, and they begin to follow the chase.  And when the boy reaches fourteen years he is taken over by the royal tutors, as they call them there:  these are four men chosen as the most highly esteemed among the Persians of mature age, namely, the wisest one, the justest one, the most temperate one,
<milestone unit="page" n="122"/><milestone unit="section" n="122a"/>and the bravest one.  The first of these teaches him the magian lore of Zoroaster,<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">Zoroaster was the reputed founder of the Persian religion, of which the ministers were the Magi or hereditary priests.</note> son of Horomazes;  and that is the worship of the gods:  he teaches him also what pertains to a king.  The justest teaches him to be truthful all his life long;  the most temperate, not to be mastered by even a single pleasure, in order that he may be accustomed to be a free man and a veritable king, who is the master first of all that is in him, not the slave;  while the bravest trains him to be fearless and undaunted, telling him that to be daunted is to be enslaved.  But you,
<milestone unit="section" n="122b"/>Alcibiades, had a tutor set over you by Pericles from amongst his servants,who was old as to be the most useless of them, Zopyrus the Thracian.  I might describe to you at length the nurture and education of your competitors, were it not too much of a task;  and besides, what I have said suffices to show the rest that follows thereon.  But about your birth, Alcibiades, or nurture or education, or about those of any other Athenian, one may say that nobody cares, unless it be some lover whom you chance to have.  And again, if you chose to glance at the wealth, the luxury,
<milestone unit="section" n="122c"/>the robes with sweeping trains, the anointings with myrrh, the attendant troops of menials, and all the other refinements of the Persians, you would be ashamed at your own case, on perceiving its inferiority to theirs. Should you choose, again, to look at the temperance and orderliness, the facility and placidity, the magnanimity and discipline, the courage and endurance, and the toil-loving, success-loving, honor-loving spirit of the Spartans, you would count yourself but a child
<milestone unit="section" n="122d"/>in all these things.  If again you regard wealth, and think yourself something in that way, I must not keep silence on this point either, if you are to realize where you stand.  For in this respect you have only to look at the wealth of the Spartans, and you will perceive that our riches here are far inferior to theirs.  Think of all the land that they have both in their own and in the Messenian country:  not one of our estates could compete with theirs in extent and excellence, nor again in ownership of slaves, and especially of those of the helot class, nor yet of horses,
<milestone unit="section" n="122e"/>nor of all the flocks and herds that graze in <placeName key="perseus,Messene">Messene</placeName>.  However, I pass over all these things:  but there is more gold and silver privately held in <placeName key="tgn,7011065">Lacedaemon</placeName> than in the whole of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>;  for during many generations treasure has been passing in to them from every part of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>, and often from the barbarians also, but not passing out to anyone;  and just as in the fable of Aesop,
<milestone unit="page" n="123"/><milestone unit="section" n="123a"/>where the fox remarked to the lion on the direction of the footmarks, the traces of the money going into <placeName key="tgn,7011065">Lacedaemon</placeName> are clear enough, but nowhere are any to be seen of it coming out;  so that one can be pretty sure that those people are the richest of the Greeks in gold and silver, and that among themselves the richest is the king;  for the largest and most numerous receipts of the kind are those of the kings,
<milestone unit="section" n="123b"/>and besides there is the levy of the royal tribute in no slight amount, which the Spartans pay to their kings.  Now, the Spartan fortunes, though great compared with the wealth of other Greeks, are nought beside that of the Persians and their king.  For I myself was once told by a trustworthy person, who had been up to their court, that he traversed a very large tract of excellent land, nearly a day's journey, which the inhabitants called the girdle of the king's wife, and another which was similarly called her veil; 
<milestone unit="section" n="123c"/>and many other fine and fertile regions reserved for the adornment of the consort;  and each of these regions was named after some part of her apparel.  So I imagine, if someone should say to the king's mother Amestris, who was wife of Xerxes, &ldquo;The son of Deinomache<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">The mother of Alcibiades.</note> intends to challenge your son;  the mother's dresses are worth perhaps fifty minae at the outside, while the son has under three hundred acres at Erchiae,<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">In <placeName key="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName>, about fifteen miles east of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>.</note>&rdquo; she would wonder to what on earth this
<milestone unit="section" n="123d"/>Alcibiades could be trusting, that he proposed to contend against Artaxerxes;  and I expect she would remark&mdash;&ldquo;The only possible things that the man can be trusting to for his enterprise are industry and wisdom;  for these are the only things of any account among the Greeks.&rdquo;  Whereas if she were informed that this Alcibiades who is actually making such an attempt is, in the first place, as yet barely twenty years old, and secondly, altogether uneducated;  and further, that when his lover tells him that he must first learn, and take pains over himself, and practise,
<milestone unit="section" n="123e"/>before he enters on a contest with the king, he refuses, and says he will do very well as he is;  I expect she would ask in surprise, &ldquo;On what, then, can the youngster rely?&rdquo;  And if we told her, &ldquo;On beauty, stature, birth, wealth, and mental gifts,&rdquo; she would conclude we were mad, Alcibiades, when she compared the advantages of her own people in all these respects.  And I imagine that even Lampido, daughter of Leotychides
<milestone unit="page" n="124"/><milestone unit="section" n="124a"/>and wife of Archidamus and mother of Agis, who have all been kings, would wonder in the same way, when she compared her people's resources, at your intention of having a contest with her son despite your bad upbringing.  And yet, does it not strike you as disgraceful that our enemies' wives should have a better idea of the qualities that we need for an attempt against them than we have ourselves?  Ah, my remarkable friend, listen to me and the Delphic motto,
<milestone unit="section" n="124b"/>&ldquo;Know thyself&rdquo;;  for these people are our competitors, not those whom you think;  and there is nothing that will give us ascendancy over them save only pains and skill.  If you are found wanting in these, you will be found wanting also in achievement of renown among Greeks and barbarians both;  and of this I observe you to be more enamored than anyone else ever was of anything.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Well then, what are the pains that I must take, Socrates?  Can you enlighten me?  For I must say your words are remarkably like the truth.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Yes, I can:  but we must put our heads together,<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">Cf. above, <bibl n="Plat. Alc. 1.119b">Plat. Alc. 1.119b</bibl>.</note> you know, as to the way in which

<milestone unit="section" n="130c"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>But since neither the body nor the combination of the two is man, we are reduced, I suppose, to this:  either man is nothing at all, or if something, he turns out to be nothing else than soul.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Precisely so.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Well, do you require some yet clearer proof that the soul is man?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>No, I assure you:  I think it is amply proved.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And if it is tolerably, though not exactly, we are content;  exact knowledge will be ours later,
<milestone unit="section" n="130d"/>when we have discovered the thing that we passed over just now because it would involve much consideration.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>What is that?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>The point suggested in that remark a moment ago,<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">Cf. <bibl n="Plat. Alc. 1.129b">Plat. Alc. 1.129b</bibl>.</note> that we should first consider the same-in-itself;  but so far, instead of the same, we have been considering what each single thing is in itself.  And perhaps we shall be satisfied with that:  for surely we cannot say that anything has more absolute possession of ourselves than the soul.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>No, indeed.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And it is proper to take the view that you and I are conversing with each other, while we make use of words, by intercourse of soul with soul?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Quite so.
<milestone unit="section" n="130e"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Well, that is just what we suggested a little while ago&mdash;that Socrates, in using words to talk with Alcibiades, is holding speech, not with your face, it would seem, but with Alcibiades&mdash;that is, with his soul.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>I believe so.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then he who enjoins a knowledge of oneself bids us become acquainted with the soul.
<milestone unit="page" n="131"/><milestone unit="section" n="131a"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>So it seems.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And anyone who gets to know something belonging to the body knows the things that are his, but not himself.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>That is so.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then no physician, in so far as he is a physician, knows himself, nor does any trainer, in so far as he is a trainer.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>It seems not.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And farmers, and craftsmen generally, are far from knowing themselves.  For these people, it would seem, do not even know their own things, but only things still more remote than their own things, in respect of the arts which they follow;  since they know
<milestone unit="section" n="131b"/>but the things of the body, with which it is tended.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>That is true.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>So if knowing oneself is temperance, none of these people is temperate in respect of his art.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>None, I agree.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And that is why these arts are held to be sordid, and no acquirements for a good man.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Quite so.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then once again, whoever tends his body tends his own things, but not himself?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>It looks rather like it.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>But whoever tends his money tends neither himself nor
<milestone unit="section" n="131c"/>his own things, but only things yet more remote than his own things?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>I agree.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>So that the money-maker has ceased to do his own business.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Correct.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And if anyone is found to be a lover of Alcibiades' body, he has fallen in love, not with Alcibiades, but with something belonging to Alcibiades?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>That is true.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Your lover is rather he who loves your soul?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>He must be, apparently, by our argument.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And he who loves your body quits you, and is gone, as soon as its bloom is over?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Apparently.
<milestone unit="section" n="131d"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Whereas he who loves your soul will not quit you so long as it makes for what is better?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>So it seems.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And I am he who does not quit you, but remains with you when your body's prime is over, and the rest have departed.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Yes, and I am glad of it, Socrates, and hope you will not go.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then you must endeavor to be as handsome as you can.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Well, I shall endeavor.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>You see how you stand:  Alcibiades,
<milestone unit="section" n="131e"/>the son of Cleinias, it seems, neither had nor has any lover except one only, and that a cherished one, Socrates, the son of Sophroniscus and Phaenarete.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>True.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And you said that I only just anticipated you in coming to you, for otherwise you would have come to me first for the purpose of inquiring why I am the only one who does not leave you?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Yes, that was so.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then the reason was that I was the only lover of you, whereas the rest were lovers of what is yours;  and that is losing its charm,
    <milestone unit="page" n="132"/><milestone unit="section" n="132a"/>while you are beginning to bloom.  So now, if you are not blighted and deformed by the Athenian people, I shall never forsake you.  For my chiefest fear is of your being blighted by becoming a lover of the people, since many a good Athenian has come to that ere now.  For fair of face is <quote type="verse paraphrase">&ldquo;the people of great-hearted Erechtheus;&rdquo;</quote><bibl n="Hom. Il. 2.547">Hom.

<milestone unit="section" n="132b"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Exercise yourself first, my wonderful friend, in learning what you ought to know before entering on politics;  you must wait till you have learnt, in order that you may be armed with an antidote and so come to no harm.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Your advice seems to me good, Socrates;  but try to explain in what way we can take pains over ourselves.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Well, we have made one step in advance;  for there is a pretty fair agreement now as to what we are, whereas we were afraid we might fail of this and take pains, without knowing it, over something other than ourselves.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>That is so.
<milestone unit="section" n="132c"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And the next step, we see, is to take care of the soul, and look to that.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Clearly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>While handing over to others the care of our bodies and our coffers.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Quite so.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then how shall we obtain the most certain knowledge of it?  For if we know that, it seems we shall know ourselves also.  In Heaven's name, do we fail to comprehend the wise words of the Delphic inscription, which we mentioned just now?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>With what intent do you say that, Socrates?
<milestone unit="section" n="132d"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>I will tell you what I suspect to be the real advice which the inscription gives us.  I rather think there are not many illustrations of it to be found, but only in the case of sight.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>What do you mean by that?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Consider in your turn:  suppose that, instead of speaking to a man, it said to the eye of one of us, as a piece of advice &ldquo;See thyself,&rdquo; how should we apprehend the meaning of the admonition?  Would it not be, that the eye should look at that by looking at which it would see itself?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Clearly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then let us think what object there is anywhere, by looking at which
<milestone unit="section" n="132e"/>we can see both it and ourselves.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Why, clearly, Socrates, mirrors and things of that sort.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Quite right.  And there is also something of that sort in the eye that we see with?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>To be sure.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And have you observed that the face of the person who looks into another's eye is shown in the optic confronting him,
<milestone unit="page" n="133"/><milestone unit="section" n="133a"/>as in a mirror, and we call this the pupil,<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">The Greek <foreign lang="greek">ko/rh</foreign> and the Latin &ldquo;pupilla&rdquo; both mean &ldquo;little girl&rdquo; or &ldquo;doll,&rdquo; and were used to indicate the dark center of the eye in which a tiny image can be seen reflected.</note> for in a sort it is an image of the person looking?
<milestone unit="section" n="133b"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>That is true.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then an eye viewing another eye, and looking at the most perfect part of it, the thing wherewith it sees, will thus see itself.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Apparently.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>But if it looks at any other thing in man or at anything in nature but what resembles this,<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">i.e. it must look at the pupil of a man's eye, or at what is comparable to that &ldquo;perfect part&rdquo; in other things.</note> it will not see itself.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>That is true.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then if an eye is to see itself, it must look at an eye, and at that region of the eye in which the virtue of an eye is found to occur;  and this, I presume, is sight.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>That is so.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And if the soul too, my dear Alcibiades, is to know herself, she must surely look at a soul, and especially at that region of it in which occurs the virtue of a soul&mdash;wisdom, and at any other part of a soul which resembles this?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>I agree, Socrates.
<milestone unit="section" n="133c"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And can we find any part of the soul that we can call more divine than this, which is the seat of knowledge and thought?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>We cannot.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then this part of her resembles God, and whoever looks at this, and comes to know all that is divine, will gain thereby the best knowledge of himself.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Apparently.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And self-knowledge we admitted to be temperance.<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">Above, <bibl n="Plat.

Alc. 1.131b</bibl>.</note></p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>To be sure.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>So if we have no knowledge of ourselves and no temperance, shall we be able to know our own belongings, good or evil?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>How can that be, Socrates?
<milestone unit="section" n="133d"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>For I expect it seems impossible to you that without knowing Alcibiades you should know that the belongings of Alcibiades are in fact his.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Impossible indeed, upon my word.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Nor could we know that our belongings are ours if we did not even know ourselves?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>How could we?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And so, if we did not so much as know our belongings, we could not know the belongings of our belongings either?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Apparently not.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then we were not quite correct in admitting just now that there are people who, without knowing themselves, know their belongings, while others know their belongings' belongings.  For it seems to be the function of one man and one art to discern all three&mdash;
<milestone unit="section" n="133e"/>himself, his belongings, and the belongings of his belongings.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>It looks like it.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And anyone who is ignorant of his belongings will be similarly ignorant, I suppose, of the belongings of others.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Quite so.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And if ignorant of others' affairs, he will be ignorant also of the affairs of states.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>He must be.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then such a man can never be a statesman.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>No, indeed.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>No, nor an economist either.
<milestone unit="page" n="134"/><milestone unit="section" n="134a"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>No, indeed.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Nor will he know what he is doing.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>No, I agree.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And will not he who does not know make mistakes?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>To be sure.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And when he makes mistakes, will he not do ill both in private and in public?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Of course.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And doing ill he will be wretched?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Yes, very.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And what of those for whom he is doing so?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>They will be wretched also.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then it is impossible to be happy if one is not temperate and good.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Impossible.
<milestone unit="section" n="134b"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>So it is the bad men who are wretched.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Yes, very.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And hence it is not he who has made himself rich that is relieved of wretchedness, but he who has made himself temperate.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Apparently.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>So it is not walls or warships or arsenals that cities need, Alcibiades, if they are to be happy, nor numbers, nor size, without virtue.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>No, indeed.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And if you are to manage the city's affairs properly and honorably, you must impart virtue to the citizens.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Of course.
<milestone unit="section" n="134c"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>But could one possibly impart a thing that one had not?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>How, indeed?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then you or anyone else who is to be governor and curator, not merely of himself and his belongings in private, but of the state and its affairs, must first acquire virtue himself.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>That is true.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Hence it is not licence or authority for doing what one pleases that you have to secure to yourself or the state, but justice and temperance.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Apparently.
<milestone unit="section" n="134d"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>For you and the state, if you act justly and temperately, will act so as to please God.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Naturally.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And, as we were saying in what went before, you will act with your eyes turned on what is divine and bright.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Apparently.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Well, and looking thereon you will behold and know both yourselves and your good.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And so you will act aright and well?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Yes.
<milestone unit="section" n="134e"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Well now, if you act in this way, I am ready to warrant that you must be happy.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>And I can rely on your warranty.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>But if you act unjustly, with your eyes on the godless and dark, the probability is that your acts will resemble these through your ignorance of yourselves.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>That is probable.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>For if a man, my dear Alcibiades, is at liberty to do what he pleases, but is lacking in mind, what is the probable result to him personally, or to the state as well?  For instance, if he is sick and at liberty to do what he pleases&mdash;without a medical mind,
<milestone unit="page" n="135"/><milestone unit="section" n="135a"/>but with a despot's power which prevents anyone from even reproving him&mdash;what will be the result?  Will not his health, in all likelihood, be shattered?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>That is true.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Again, in a ship, if a man were at liberty to do what he chose, but were devoid of mind and excellence in navigation, do you perceive what must happen to him and his fellow-sailors?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>I do:  they must all perish.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And in just the same way, if a state, or any office or authority, is lacking in excellence or virtue,
<milestone unit="section" n="135b"/>it will be overtaken by failure?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>It must.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then it is not despotic power, my admirable Alcibiades, that you ought to secure either to yourself or to the state, if you would be happy, but virtue.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>That is true.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And before getting virtue, to be governed by a superior is better than to govern, for a man as well as a child.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Apparently.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And the better is also nobler?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And the nobler more becoming?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Of course.
<milestone unit="section" n="135c"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then it becomes a bad man to be a slave, since it is better.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>So vice is a thing that becomes a slave.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Apparently.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And virtue becomes a free man.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And we should shun, my good friend, all slavishness?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Most certainly, Socrates.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And do you now perceive how you stand?  Are you on the side of the free, or not?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>I think I perceive only too clearly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then do you know how you may escape from the condition in which you now find yourself?

<milestone unit="section" n="138b"/>as I believe.

<milestone unit="section" n="139c"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>By no means.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then it looks as though unwisdom and madness were the same.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Yes, apparently.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>So we shall be right, Alcibiades, in saying that all unwise persons are mad;  for example, such of your contemporaries as happen to be unwise&mdash;some such there are&mdash;and of your elders, even:  for tell me, in Heaven's name, do you not think that in our city the wise people are but few, whereas the majority are unwise, and these you call mad?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>I do.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Well, do you suppose we could safely live with so many

Do you not think that, although he may be afflicted in none of these ways, he may be suffering from some other disease?  For surely there are many of them:  these are not the only ones.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>I agree.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And is every ophthalmia, in your opinion, a disease?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And is every disease also ophthalmia?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>No, I should think not:  still, I am in doubt as to my meaning.

For everyone in a fever is sick, but yet not everyone who is sick has a fever or the gout

But all these things are unwisdom, though they differ, as we observed that one art or one disease differs from another.  Or how does it strike you?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>That is my view.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then let us turn at this point and retrace our steps.  For we said, you know, at the beginning that we must consider who the unwise can be, and who the wise:  for we had admitted that there are such persons, had we not?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Yes, we have admitted it.
<milestone unit="section" n="140e"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then you conceive those to be wise who know what one ought to do and say?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>I do.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And which are the unwise?  Those who know neither of these things?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>The same.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And those who know neither of these things will say and do unawares what one ought not?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Apparently.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Well, just such a person, as I was saying, Alcibiades,
<milestone unit="page" n="141"/><milestone unit="section" n="141a"/>was Oedipus;  and even in our time you will find many who do the same, not in a fit of anger, as he was:  they think they pray not for something evil, but for something good.  He neither prayed for that, nor thought he did, but there are others who are in the opposite case.  For I imagine that if the god to whom you are now going should appear to you and first ask you, before you made any prayer, whether you would be content to become sovereign of the Athenian state and, on your accounting this as something poor and unimportant, should add &ldquo;and of all the Greeks also&rdquo;;  and if he saw
<milestone unit="section" n="141b"/>you were still unsatisfied unless he promised you besides the mastery of all <placeName key="tgn,1000003">Europe</placeName>, and should not merely promise you that, but on the self-same day a recognition by all men, if you so desired, of Alcibiades, son of Cleinias, as their sovereign&mdash;I imagine you would actually depart in a transport of delight, as having secured the greatest of goods.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>So would anybody else, I imagine, Socrates, at such a stroke of luck!
<milestone unit="section" n="141c"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>But still you would not wish to sacrifice your life even for the territory and sovereignty of all the Greeks and barbarians together.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>I should think not.  How could I, without a prospect of making any use of them?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And what if you had a prospect of making an evil and injurious use of them?  Not in this case either?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>No, indeed.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>So you see it is not safe either to accept casually what one is given, or to pray for one's own advancement, if one is going to be injured in consequence, or deprived of one's life altogether.  Yet we could tell of
    <milestone unit="section" n="141d"/>"&gt; many ere now who, having desired sovereignty, and endeavored to secure it, with the idea of working for their good, have lost their lives by plots which their sovereignty has provoked.  And I expect you are not unacquainted with certain events  <quote type="Verse paraphrase">&ldquo;of a day or two ago,&rdquo;</quote><bibl n="Hom. Il. 2.303">Hom. Il. 2.303</bibl> when Archelaus, the monarch of <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName>, was slain<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">This assassination occurred in <date value="-399">399</date> B.C., the year of Socrates' death.</note> by his favorite, who was as much in love with the monarchy as Archelaus was with him, and who killed his lover
<milestone unit="section" n="141e"/>with the expectation of being not only the monarch, but also a happy man:  but after holding the monarchy for three or four days he was plotted against by others in his turn, and perished.  You have only to look at some of our own citizens&mdash;and these are examples that we know, not by hearsay, but by personal observation&mdash;who in their time have desired to hold military command
<milestone unit="page" n="142"/><milestone unit="section" n="142a"/>and have obtained it, and see how some to this very day are exiles from our city, while others have lost their lives.  And even those who are deemed to be faring best have not only gone through many dangers and terrors in holding their command, but on returning home have continued to be as sorely besieged by informers as they were by the enemy, so that some of them wished to heaven
<milestone unit="section" n="142b"/>that they had been anything but commanders rather than have held such appointments.  Of course, if these dangers and toils were conducive to our advantage, there would be some reason for them;  but the case is quite the contrary.  And you will find it is just the same in regard to children:  some people have been known to pray that they might have them, and when they have got them have fallen into the greatest disasters and pains.  For some have had children that were utterly bad, and have spent their whole lives in repining;  while others, though they had good ones,
<milestone unit="section" n="142c"/>were bereft of them by disasters that overtook them, and thus were cast into as great misfortune as the others, and wished that no children at all had been born to them.  But nevertheless, with all this plain evidence, and a great deal more of a similar kind, before men's eyes, it is rare to find anyone who has either declined what was offered to him or, when he was likely to gain something by prayer, refrained from praying.  Most men would not decline the offer of either a monarchy or a generalship
    <milestone unit="section" n="142d"/>or any of the various other things which bring with them harm rather than benefit, but would even pray to be granted them in cases where they were lacking:  but after a little while they often change their tune, and retract all their former prayers.  I question therefore if men are not really wrong in blaming the gods as the authors of their ills, when <quote type="verse paraphrase">&ldquo;they themselves by their own presumption&rdquo;</quote><bibl n="Hom. Od. 1.32">Hom. Od. 1.32</bibl>&mdash;or unwisdom, shall we say?&mdash;

Od.  1.32</bibl> It would seem, at any rate, Alcibiades, that one old poet had some wisdom;  for I conceive it was because he had some foolish friends, whom he saw working and praying for things that were not for their advantage, though supposed to be by them, that he made a common prayer on behalf of them all, in terms something like these:
<milestone unit="page" n="143"/><milestone unit="section" n="143a"/><cit><quote type="verse"><l met="u">King Zeus, give unto us what is good, whether we pray or pray not;</l><l>But what is grievous, even if we pray for it, do thou avert.</l></quote><bibl>Anth.

<milestone unit="section" n="143b"/>but&mdash;worst of all&mdash;into praying to be granted the greatest evils.  Now that is a thing that no one would suppose of himself;  each of us would rather suppose he was competent to pray for his own greatest good, not his greatest evil.  Why, that would seem, in truth, more like some sort of curse than a prayer!</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>But perhaps, my excellent friend, some person who is wiser than either you or I may say we are wrong to be so free with our abuse of ignorance,
<milestone unit="section" n="143c"/>unless we can add that it is ignorance of certain things, and is a good to certain persons in certain conditions, as to those others it is an evil.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>How do you mean?  Can there be anything of which it is better for anybody, in any condition whatsoever, to be ignorant than cognizant?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>I believe so;  and do not you?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>No, indeed, upon my word.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>But surely I shall not have to tax you with an inclination to commit such an act against your own mother as Orestes and Alcmaeon,
<milestone unit="section" n="143d"/>and any others who have followed their example, are said to have committed against theirs.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>No unlucky words, in Heaven's name, Socrates!</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Why, it is not the person who says, Alcibiades, that you would not like to be guilty of such an act, whom you should bid avoid unlucky words, but much rather him who might say the contrary;  since the act seems to you so very dreadful as to be unfit even for such casual mention.  But do you think that Orestes, if he had had all his wits about him and had known what was best for him to do, would have brought himself to commit any act of the sort?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>No, indeed.
<milestone unit="section" n="143e"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Nor would anyone else, I imagine.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>No.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then it seems that ignorance of what is best, and to be ignorant of the best, is a bad thing.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>I agree.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And not only for the person himself, but for everyone else?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then let us consider this further case.  Suppose it should quite suddenly occur to your mind that you had better take a dagger and go to the door of Pericles, your own guardian and friend,
<milestone unit="page" n="144"/><milestone unit="section" n="144a"/>and ask if he were at home, with the design of killing just him and no one else, and his servants said he was at home:  now, I do not say you would be inclined to do any such thing, but I suppose, if you are under the impression which at some moment may well be present, surely, to the mind of a man who is ignorant of the best&mdash;that what is really the worst is best at some moment&mdash;or do you not agree?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Quite so.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Well then, if you went indoors and saw Pericles himself,
<milestone unit="section" n="144b"/>but did not know him, and thought he was somebody else, would you still venture to kill him?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>No, upon my word, I should think not.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>For your man was, I presume, not anyone you met, but that particular person whom you wished to kill?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And although you might make a number of attempts, if you always failed to know Pericles when you were about to commit the act, you would never attack him.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>No, indeed.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Well now, do you suppose that Orestes would ever have attacked his mother if he had similarly failed to know her?
<milestone unit="section" n="144c"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>I do not think he would.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>For presumably he, too, had no intention of killing the first woman he met, or anybody else's mother, but only his own.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>That is so.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then to be ignorant in such matters is better for those who are so disposed and have formed such resolves.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Apparently.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>So you see that ignorance of certain things is for certain persons in certain states a good, not an evil, as you supposed just now.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>It seems to be.
<milestone unit="section" n="144d"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then if you care to consider the sequel of this, I daresay it will surprise you.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>What may that be, Socrates?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>I mean that, generally speaking, it rather looks as though the possession of the sciences as a whole, if it does not include possession of the science of the best, will in a few instances help, but in most will harm, the owner.  Consider it this way:  must it not be the case, in your opinion, that when we are about to do or say anything, we first suppose that we know, or do really know, the thing
<milestone unit="section" n="144e"/>we so confidently intend to say or do?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>I think so.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Well, take the orators, for example:  they either know, or think they know, how to advise us on various occasions&mdash;some about war and peace, and others about building walls or fitting up harbors; 
<milestone unit="page" n="145"/><milestone unit="section" n="145a"/>and in a word, whatever the city does to another city or within herself, all comes about by the advice of the orators.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>That is true.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then observe the consequence.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>If I am able.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Why, surely you call men either wise or unwise?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>I do.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And the many unwise, and the few wise?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Precisely.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And in either case you name them in reference to something?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Yes.
<milestone unit="section" n="145b"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then do you call a man wise who knows how to give advice, without knowing whether and when it is better to act upon it?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>No, indeed.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Nor, I conceive, a man who knows what war is in itself, without knowing when or for how long a time it is better to make war?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Agreed.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Nor, again, a man who knows how to kill another, or seize his property, or make him an exile from his native land, without knowing when or to whom it is better so to behave?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>No, to be sure.
<milestone unit="section" n="145c"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then it is a man who knows something of this sort, and is assisted by knowledge of what is best,&mdash;and this is surely the same as knowledge of the useful, is it not?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And we shall call him wise, and a competent adviser both of the city and of his own self;  but a man not so qualified we shall call the opposite of these.  How do you think?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>I agree.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And what of a man who knows how to ride or shoot, or else to box or wrestle or contend in any other sport,
<milestone unit="section" n="145d"/>or do anything that we know by rule of art?  What do you call him who knows what is better done by rule of that particular art?  Do you not say that he who goes by the rules of riding is a good rider?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>I do.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And the rules of boxing, I suppose, make a good boxer, and those of flute-playing a good flute-player, and so, on the same lines,<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb"><foreign lang="greek">a)na\ lo/gon</foreign> occurs, with the genitive, in <bibl n="Plat.

<milestone unit="section" n="145e"/>or shall we say he comes far short of it?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Far short of it, I declare.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then what sort of state do you suppose it would be, where the people were good bowmen and flute-players, together with athletes and artists in general, and mingled with these the men whom we have just mentioned as knowing war in itself and slaughter in itself, and orator-windbags too with their political bluster, but all of them lacked this knowledge of the best, and none knew when or upon whom it was better

<milestone unit="section" n="146d"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then it is an advantage to the many neither to know nor to think they know anything, if they are going to be specially eager to do what they know or think they know, but are likely on the whole, in doing it, to be injured rather than benefited.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>That is very true.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>So you see that when I said it looked as though
<milestone unit="section" n="146e"/>the possession of the sciences as a whole, where it did not include the science of the best, in a few cases helped, but in most harmed the owner, I was evidently right in very truth, was I not?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Though I did not then, I think so now, Socrates.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Hence the state or soul that is to live aright must hold fast to this knowledge, exactly as a sick man does to a doctor, or as he who would voyage safely does to a pilot.  For without this,
<milestone unit="page" n="147"/><milestone unit="section" n="147a"/>the more briskly it is wafted by fortune either to the acquisition of wealth or to bodily strength or aught else of the sort, the greater will be the mistakes in which these things, it would seem, must needs involve it.  And he who has acquired the so-called mastery of learning and arts, but is destitute of this knowledge and impelled by this or that one among those others, is sure to meet with much rough weather, as he truly deserves;  since, I imagine, he must continue without a pilot on the high seas, and has only the brief span of his life in which to run his course. 
<milestone unit="section" n="147b"/>So that his case aptly fits the saying of the poet, in which he complains of somebody or other that <quote type="verse"><l met="dactylic">Full many crafts he knew:  but still</l><l>He knew them all so very ill.</l></quote><bibl>Margites, Fr.</bibl><note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">Quoted from the mock-epic <title>Margites</title>, of which only this and five other lines have survived.  The hero, Margites, became the proverbial type of a blundering idiot, and the poem was generally attributed to Homer.</note></p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Why, how on earth is the poet's saying apposite, Socrates?  For to my mind it has nothing to do with the point.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>It is very much to the point:  but he, good sir, like almost every other poet, speaks in riddles.  For poetry as a whole is by nature
<milestone unit="section" n="147c"/>inclined to riddling, and it is not every man who can apprehend it.  And furthermore, besides having this natural tendency, when it gets hold of a grudging person who wishes not to show forth to us his own wisdom but to conceal it as much as possible, we find it an extraordinarily difficult matter to make out whatever this or that one of them may mean.  For surely you do not suppose that Homer, divinest and wisest of poets, did not know it was impossible to know ill;  for it is he who says of Margites that he knew many things,
<milestone unit="section" n="147d"/>but knew them all ill:  but it is a riddle, I think, in which he has made &ldquo;ill&rdquo; stand for &ldquo;evil,&rdquo; and &ldquo;knew&rdquo; for &ldquo;to know.&rdquo;  So if we put it together, letting the meter go, indeed, but grasping his meaning, we get this:  &ldquo;Full many crafts he knew, but it was evil for him to know them all.&rdquo;<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">This trick of twisting the words of a quotation into an unnatural meaning is quite characteristic of Socrates.  Cf.  <bibl n="Plat. Prot. 343">Plat. Prot. 343-7</bibl>.</note> Then clearly, if it was evil for him to know many things, he was in fact a paltry fellow, assuming we are to believe what we have previously argued.
<milestone unit="section" n="147e"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>But I think we may, Socrates:  at least, if I cannot believe those arguments of ours, I shall find it hard to trust any others.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And you are right in so thinking.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>I repeat that I think so.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>But come now, in Heaven's name&mdash;for I suppose you see how great and strange is our perplexity, in which you, as it seems to me, have your share;  for you change about from this side to that without settling down for a moment, but as soon as you are firmly convinced of a thing you seem to slip out of it again and
<milestone unit="page" n="148"/><milestone unit="section" n="148a"/>cease to hold the same view&mdash;well, if the god to whom you are going should even now appear to you and ask before you uttered any prayer, whether you would be content to obtain one of those things which were mentioned at the beginning, or whether he should leave you to pray as you were, how do you suppose you would make the best of your chance&mdash;by accepting his offer, or by praying for something on your own account?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Well, by the gods, I could not answer your question, Socrates, offhand.  Why, I take it to be a fatuous request,<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">i.e., that I should answer offhand.  The pun in , <foreign lang="greek">ma/rgon</foreign>, alluding to the &ldquo;fatuous&rdquo; Margites, cannot be rendered in English.</note>
<milestone unit="section" n="148b"/>when it is really a case for great caution lest one pray unawares for what is evil while thinking it to be one's good, and then after a little while, as you were saying,<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb"><bibl n="Plat.

<milestone unit="section" n="148c"/>or perhaps the result of their own study, that causes the Spartans to offer a similar prayer whether the occasion be private or public&mdash;that the gods will give them for their own benefit the beautiful as well as the good:  more than this no one can ever hear them pray for.  The consequence is that to the present time<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">This seems to be the meaning of the Greek, which is certainly not Platonic.  In <bibl n="Aristot. Ph. 4.13.5">Aristot. Phys. 4.13.5</bibl> <foreign lang="greek">o( parh/kwn xro/nos</foreign>  means &ldquo;past time.&rdquo;</note> they have been just as fortunate as any other people;  and if it has befallen them to be not invariably fortunate, it was anyhow not owing to their prayer. 
<milestone unit="section" n="148d"/>It rests with the gods, I conceive, to give us either what we may pray for or the reverse. And I would like to give you an account of something else, which I once heard from some of my seniors.  A quarrel having arisen between the Athenians and the Spartans, it befell our city to be always unsuccessful in every battle by land and sea, and she could never win a victory.  So the Athenians, in their annoyance at this result, and at a loss for some means of finding a deliverance from the trouble they were in,
<milestone unit="section" n="148e"/>took counsel together and decided that the best thing they could do was to send and inquire of Ammon<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">An Ethiopian god whose cult spread over <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>, and through <placeName key="tgn,7000639">Cyrene</placeName> to various parts of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>:  he had temples at <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName> and <placeName key="perseus,Sparta">Sparta</placeName>, but the famous one in the Libyan desert is probably meant here.</note>;  and moreover, to ask also for what reason the gods granted victory to the Spartans rather than to themselves:  &ldquo;for we&rdquo;&mdash;such was the message&mdash; &ldquo;offer up to them more and finer sacrifices than any of the Greeks, and have adorned their temples with votive emblems as no other people have done, and presented to the gods the costliest and stateliest processions year by year, and spent more money thus than
<milestone unit="page" n="149"/><milestone unit="section" n="149a"/>all the rest of the Greeks together.  But the Spartans have never taken any such pains, and indeed are so neglectful in their behavior to the gods, that they make a practice of sacrificing defective victims, and generally are very much behind us in the honors that they pay, though the wealth they possess is quite equal to that of our city.&rdquo; When they had so spoken, and added the question, what they should do in order to find a deliverance from the trouble they were in,
<milestone unit="section" n="149b"/>the prophet's only answer<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">The use of <foreign lang="greek">a)pokriqh=nai</foreign>  for &ldquo;answered&rdquo; instead of the usual <foreign lang="greek">a)pokri/nasqai</foreign>  is evidence for placing the writer a good deal later than Plato.</note>&mdash;  evidently it was all that the god allowed&mdash;was to call them to him and say:  &ldquo;Thus saith Ammon to the Athenians:  I would rather have the reverent reserve<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb"><foreign lang="greek">eu)fhmi/a</foreign> means &ldquo;avoidance of speech that may offend&rdquo;&mdash;the opposite being <foreign lang="greek">blasfhmi/a</foreign>.</note> of the Spartans than all the ritual of the Greeks.&rdquo; So much he said, and not a word further.  Now by &ldquo;reverent reserve&rdquo; I suppose the god could only mean their prayer, since in fact it differs greatly from those that are generally offered. 
<milestone unit="section" n="149c"/>For the Greeks in general either lead up bulls with gilded horns, or else present the gods with votive emblems, and pray for any odd thing, whether it be good or bad:  so when the gods hear their irreverent speech they reject all these costly processions and sacrifices.  Whereas I think we ought to be very cautious, and fully consider what is to be said and what is not. And in Homer too you will find other tales of a similar sort.  For he relates how the Trojans,
    <milestone unit="section" n="149d"/>in making their bivouac,<quote type="verse"><l met="dactylic">Sacrificed to the immortals perfect hecatombs,</l></quote><bibl n="Hom. Il. 8.548">Hom.

<milestone unit="section" n="149e"/><cit><quote type="verse"><l met="C">And Priam, and the folk of Priam of the good ashen spear.</l></quote><bibl>Hom. Il. 8.550-2</bibl></cit><note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">The four lines directly quoted are not in our manuscripts of Homer, but have been inserted in modern texts as <bibl n="Hom. Il. 8.548">Hom. Il. 8.548, 550-2</bibl>.</note>So it was nothing to their purpose to sacrifice and pay tribute of gifts in vain, when they were hated by the gods.  For it is not, I imagine, the way of the gods to be seduced with gifts, like a base insurer.  And indeed it is but silly talk of ours, if we claim to surpass the Spartans on this score.  For it would be a strange thing if the gods had regard to our gifts and sacrifices instead of our souls, and the piety and
<milestone unit="page" n="150"/><milestone unit="section" n="150a"/>justice that may be found in any of us.  Far rather at these, I believe, do they look than at those costly processions and sacrifices which are offered, it well may be, by individual and state, year in, year out, though they may have offended greatly against the gods, or as greatly against their neighbors.  But the gods are not to be won by bribes, and so they despise all these things, as Ammon and the holy prophet say.  Certainly it would seem that justice and wisdom are held in especial honor both by the gods and by men of intelligence; 
<milestone unit="section" n="150b"/>and wise and just are they alone who know what acts and words to use towards gods and men.  But I should like now to hear what may be your opinion on the subject.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Why, Socrates, it in no wise differs from yours and the god's;  for indeed it would not be fitting for me to record my vote against the god.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And you remember you professed to be in great perplexity lest you should pray unawares for evil,
<milestone unit="section" n="150c"/>while supposing it to be good?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>I do.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>You see, then, how unsafe it is for you to approach the god with your prayers, for it may chance that when he hears your irreverent speech he will reject your sacrifice altogether, and you may perhaps be accorded some other bad thing as well.  In my opinion, therefore, it is best to hold your peace:  for I expect you will not consent to use the Spartan's prayer, you have such a romantic spirit&mdash;to give it the fairest of folly's names.<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">Cf. <bibl n="Plat. Alc. 2.140c">Plat. Alc. 2.140c</bibl>.</note>
    <milestone unit="section" n="150d"/>It is necessary, therefore, to bide one's time until one can learn how one should behave towards gods and men.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Well, when will that time arrive, Socrates, and who is to be my instructor?  For I feel I should very much like to see who the man is,</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>It is he who is concerned about you.  But I think, as Homer relates how Athena removed the mist from the eyes of Diomede,<quote type="verse"><l met="dactylic">That be might well discern both god and man,</l></quote><bibl n="Hom. Il. 5.127">Hom. Il. 5.127.</bibl>
<milestone unit="section" n="150e"/>so you too must first have the mist removed which now enwraps your soul, and then you will be ready to receive the means whereby you will discern both evil and good.  For at present I do not think you could do so.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Let him remove the mist or whatever else he likes to call it:  for I am prepared to obey every one of his commands, without shirking, whoever the man may be, so long as I am to be the better for them.
<milestone unit="page" n="151"/><milestone unit="section" n="151a"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>I tell you, he on his part is prodigiously anxious to help you.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>Then I think it best to defer the sacrifice also till the time comes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And you are quite right:  for that is safer than running so serious a risk.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Alcibiades</speaker><p>But how say you, Socrates?  Look now, I will crown you with this garland, as I consider you have given me such good advice;  and to the gods
    <milestone unit="section" n="151b"/>we shall offer both garlands and all the other customary things when I see that day has come.  And come it will ere long, if they are willing.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Well, I accept this gift;  and anything else besides, that you may give me, I shall be only too happy to accept.<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">The Greek here is literally&mdash;&ldquo;I should gladly see myself to have accepted&rdquo;&mdash;which seems very unplatonic.</note> And as Euripides has made Creon say when he sees Teiresias wearing his wreaths, and hears that he has obtained them, on account of his art, as first-fruits of the spoils of war:<quote type="verse"><l met="iambic">As omen good I take thy victor's wreaths;</l><l>For in the waves we labour, as you know,&mdash;</l></quote><bibl n="Eur.

<milestone unit="section" n="151c"/>so do I take this opinion of yours as a good omen.  For I consider I am no less wave-tossed than Creon, and would like to come off victorious over your lovers.</p></sp></body></text>

And to what are you referring now?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>I mean my and your fellow-citizen, Pisistratus's son Hipparchus, of Philaidae, who was the eldest and wisest of Pisistratus's sons, and who, among the many goodly proofs of wisdom that he showed, first brought the poems of Homer into this country of ours, and compelled the rhapsodes at the Panathenaea to recite them in relay, one man following on another, as
<milestone unit="section" n="228c"/>they still do now.  He dispatched a fifty-oared galley for Anacreon of <placeName key="perseus,Teos">Teos</placeName>, and brought him into our city.  Simonides of <placeName key="tgn,7010867">Ceos</placeName> he always had about him, prevailing on him by plenteous fees and gifts.  All this he did from a wish to educate the citizens, in order that he might have subjects of the highest excellence;  for he thought it not right to grudge wisdom to any, so noble and good was he.  And when his people in the city had been educated and were admiring him for his wisdom,
<milestone unit="section" n="228d"/>he proceeded next, with the design of educating those of the countryside, to set up figures of Hermes for them along the roads in the midst of the city and every district town;  and then, after selecting from his own wise lore, both learnt from others and discovered for himself, the things that he considered the wisest, he threw these into elegiac form and inscribed them on the figures as verses of his own and testimonies of his wisdom, so that in the first place
<milestone unit="section" n="228e"/>his people should not admire those wise Delphic legends of <quote>&ldquo;Know thyself&rdquo;</quote> and <quote>&ldquo;Nothing overmuch&rdquo;</quote>, and the other sayings of the sort, but should rather regard as wise the utterances of Hipparchus;  and that in the second place, through passing up and down and reading his words and acquiring a taste for his wisdom, they might resort hither from the country for the completion of their education.  There are two such inscriptions of his:  on the left side
<milestone unit="page" n="229"/><milestone unit="section" n="229a"/>of each Hermes there is one in which the god says that he stands in the midst of the city or the township, while on the right side he says:<quote type="inscript"><l met="none">The memorial of Hipparchus:  walk with just intent.</l></quote>There are many other fine inscriptions from his poems on other figures of Hermes, and this one in particular, on the Steiria<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">A town on the south-east coast of <placeName key="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName>.</note> road, in which he says:
<milestone unit="section" n="229b"/><quote type="inscript"><l met="none">The memorial of Hipparchus:  deceive not a friend.</l></quote>I therefore should never dare, I am sure, to deceive you, who are my friend, or disobey the great Hipparchus, after whose death the Athenians were for three years under the despotic rule of his brother Hippias, and you might have heard anyone of the earlier period say that it was only in these years that there was despotism in <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>,<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">On this point the writer agrees with <bibl n="Thuc. 6.59">Thuc. 6.59</bibl>, who gives what is now the accepted story of Harmodius and Aristogeiton.</note> and that at all other times the Athenians lived very much as in the reign of Cronos.  And the subtler sort of people say
<milestone unit="section" n="229c"/>that Hipparchus's death was due, not to the cause supposed by most&mdash;the disqualification of the assassin's sister from bearing the basket,<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">In the Panathenaic procession.</note> for that is a silly motive&mdash;but because Harmodius had become the favorite of Aristogeiton and had been educated by him.  Thus Aristogeiton also prided himself on educating people, and he regarded Hipparchus as a dangerous rival.  And at that time, it is said, Harmodius
<milestone unit="section" n="229d"/>happened to be himself in love with one of the handsome and well-born youths of the day;  they do tell his name, but I cannot remember it.  Well, for a while this youth admired both Harmodius and Aristogeiton as wise men, but afterwards, when he associated with Hipparchus, he despised them, and they were so overcome with the pain of this &ldquo;disqualification&rdquo; that they slew Hipparchus.<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">This curious version of the fall of the Pisistratid rulers (Hippias and Hipparchus) seeks to explain the conspiracy as due to a rivalry in a sort of pre-Socratic influence over young men which arose between the citizen Aristogiton and the ruler Hipparchus.</note></p></sp><sp><speaker>Friend</speaker><p>It would seem, then, Socrates, either that you do not regard me as your friend, or if you do, that you do not obey Hipparchus. 
<milestone unit="section" n="229e"/>For that you are not deceiving me&mdash;though I cannot tell how you contrive it&mdash;in your talk, is more than I can believe.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Well now, as though we were playing draughts, I am willing to let you revoke, as you please, anything you have said in carrying on the discussion, in order that you may not think you are being deceived.  So tell me, shall I revoke for you the statement that all men desire good things?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Friend</speaker><p>No, thank you.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Well, that suffering loss, or loss, is an evil?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Friend</speaker><p>No, thank you.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Well, that gain, or making gain, is the opposite of loss, or suffering loss?
<milestone unit="page" n="230"/><milestone unit="section" n="230a"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Friend</speaker><p>Nor that either.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Well, that making gain, as the opposite of evil, is a good?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Friend</speaker><p>Nothing of all this do I bid you revoke for me.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>You think, then, it seems, that some gain is good, and some evil.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Friend</speaker><p>I do.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Well then, I revoke so much for you;  so let us assume that some gain is good, and some other gain evil.  But the good sort is no more gain than the evil sort, is it?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Friend</speaker><p>What do you mean by this question?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>I will explain.  Is there both good and evil food?
<milestone unit="section" n="230b"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Friend</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And is the one sort more food than the other, or are they both similarly this same thing, food, and in this respect does the one differ no wise from the other, in being food, but only in the fact of the one being good and the other evil?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Friend</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And so with drink and every other class of things that exist, when some things in any class come to be good, and others evil, one thing does not differ from another in that respect whereby they are the same?  For instance,
<milestone unit="section" n="230c"/>one man, I suppose, is virtuous, and another wicked.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Friend</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>But neither of them, I conceive, is more or less man than the other&mdash;neither the virtuous than the wicked, nor the wicked than the virtuous.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Friend</speaker><p>What you say is true.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then are we to take the same view of gain also, that both the wicked and the virtuous sort are similarly gain?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Friend</speaker><p>Necessarily.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>So he who has virtuous gain is no whit the more a gainer than he who has wicked gain:  neither sort
<milestone unit="section" n="230d"/>is found to be more gain, as we agree.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Friend</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>For neither of them has addition of either more or less.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Friend</speaker><p>No, indeed.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And how could one do or suffer anything more or less with a thing of this sort, that had neither of these additions?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Friend</speaker><p>Impossible.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Since, therefore, both of these are gains and gain-making affairs, we must now consider what it can be that leads you to call both of them gain: 
<milestone unit="section" n="230e"/>what is it that you see to be the same in both?  Suppose you were to ask me, in those instances that I gave just now, what it is that leads me to call both good food and evil food alike food, I should tell you&mdash; for this reason, because both are a dry sustenance of the body.  For that, I am sure you would agree, is what food is, would you not?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Friend</speaker><p>I would.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And so too about drink the answer would be on the same lines, that the wet sustenance of the body,
<milestone unit="page" n="231"/><milestone unit="section" n="231a"/>whether it be wholesome or pernicious, has this name of drink;  and likewise with the rest.  Try therefore on your part to imitate my method of answering.  When you say that virtuous gain and wicked gain are both gain, what is it that you see to be the same in them, judging it to be the actual element of gain?  And if again you are yourself unable to answer, just let me put it for your consideration, whether you describe as gain every acquisition that one has acquired either with no expense, or as a profit over and above one's expense.
<milestone unit="section" n="231b"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Friend</speaker><p>I believe that is what I call gain.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Do you include a case where, after enjoying a banquet at which one has had much good cheer without any expense, one acquires an illness?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Friend</speaker><p>Upon my word, not I.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And if one acquired health from attending a banquet, would one acquire gain or loss?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Friend</speaker><p>Gain.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Hence gain is not just acquiring any acquisition.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Friend</speaker><p>No, indeed.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Do you mean, not if it is evil?  Or will one acquire no gain even if one acquires something good?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Friend</speaker><p>Apparently one will, if it is good.
<milestone unit="section" n="231c"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And if it is evil, will not one acquire loss?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Friend</speaker><p>I think so.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>You see, then, how you are running round again to the same old point?  Gain is found to be good, and loss evil.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Friend</speaker><p>For my part, I cannot tell what to say.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And not without good reason, sir.  Now answer this further question:  you say that if one acquires more than the amount one has spent, it is gain?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Friend</speaker><p>I do not mean, when it is evil, but if one gets more gold or silver than one has spent.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Now, I am just going to ask you about that.  Tell me,
<milestone unit="section" n="231d"/>if one spends half a pound of gold and gets double that weight in silver, has one got gain or loss?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Friend</speaker><p>Loss, I presume, Socrates for one's gold is reduced to twice, instead of twelve times, the value of silver.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>But you see, one has got more;  or is double not more than half?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Friend</speaker><p>Not in worth, the one being silver and the other gold.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>So gain, it seems, must have this addition of worth.  At least, you now say that silver, though more than gold, is not worth as much, and that gold, though less, is of equal worth.
<milestone unit="section" n="231e"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Friend</speaker><p>Assuredly, for that is the case.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then the valuable is what produces gain, whether it be small or great, and the valueless produces no gain.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Friend</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And by the valuable you mean simply, valuable to possess?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Friend</speaker><p>Yes, to possess.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And again, by what is valuable to possess, do you mean the unprofitable or the profitable?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Friend</speaker><p>The profitable, I presume.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And the profitable is good?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Friend</speaker><p>Yes.
<milestone unit="page" n="232"/><milestone unit="section" n="232a"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And so, most valiant of men, have we not here once more, for the third or fourth time, the admission that what produces gain is good?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Friend</speaker><p>So it seems.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then do you remember the point from which this discussion of ours arose?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Friend</speaker><p>I think I do.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>In case you do not, I will remind you.  You maintained against me that good men do not wish to make all sorts of gain, but only those gains that are good, and not those that are wicked.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Friend</speaker><p>Yes.
<milestone unit="section" n="232b"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And now the argument has compelled us to acknowledge that all gains, both small and great, are good?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Friend</speaker><p>Yes, it has compelled me, at least, Socrates, rather than persuaded me.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Well, later on, perhaps, it might also persuade you.  Now, however, whether you are persuaded or whatever is your feeling, you at least agree with me that all gains are good, both small and great ones.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Friend</speaker><p>Yes, I do admit it.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And you admit that virtuous men all wish for all good things, do you not?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Friend</speaker><p>I do.
<milestone unit="section" n="232c"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>But, you know, you stated yourself that wicked men love both small and great gains.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Friend</speaker><p>I did.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And so, by your account, all men will be lovers of gain, whether they be virtuous or wicked.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Friend</speaker><p>Apparently.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Hence it is not right to reproach anybody with being a lover of gain:  for he who makes this reproach is actually such an one himself.</p></sp></body></text>

<milestone unit="page" n="132"/><milestone unit="section" n="132a"/><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>I entered the grammar school of the teacher Dionysius, and saw there the young men who are accounted the most comely in form and of distinguished family, and their lovers.  Now it chanced that two of the young people were disputing, but about what, I did not clearly overhear:  it appeared, however, that they were disputing either about Anaxagoras<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">The Ionian philosopher who lived in friendship with Pericles at <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>.</note> or about Oenopides<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">A philosopher of <placeName key="tgn,7002670">Chios</placeName>, distinguished as a geometer and astronomer.</note>;  at any rate, they appeared to be drawing circles,
<milestone unit="section" n="132b"/>and they were imitating certain inclinations<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">i.e., the slopes of the contours of the earth, and of the apparent course of the sun(ecliptic).</note> with their arms, bending to it and taking it most earnestly.  Then I&mdash;for I was sitting beside the lover of one of the pair&mdash;nudged him with my elbow and asked him what on earth the two youngsters were so earnest about, and I said:  Is it then something great and fine, in which they are so earnestly immersed?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Great and fine, indeed!  he replied:  why, these fellows are prating about the heavenly bodies, and babbling philosophy.
<milestone unit="section" n="132c"/>Then I, surprised at his answer, said:  Young man, do you consider philosophizing to be shameful?  Else, why do you speak so sharply?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Then the other youth&mdash;for he chanced to be sitting near him, as his rival in love&mdash;when he heard my question and his rival's answer, said:  You do yourself no good, Socrates, by pressing this fellow with a further question, as to whether he considers philosophizing to be shameful.  Do you not know that he has spent the whole of his life in practising the neckhold, and stuffing himself, and sleeping?  So why did you suppose he would make any other reply than that philosophy is shameful?
<milestone unit="section" n="132d"/>Now this one of the two lovers had spent his time on humane studies,<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">Literally, &ldquo;on music,&rdquo; which with the Greeks included poetry and general literature as well as music.</note> whereas the other, whom he was abusing, had spent his on athletics.  So I decided that I had best relinquish the other, whom I had been questioning, since he did not even himself set up to be experienced in words, but only in deeds;  and that I should interrogate the one who set up to be wiser, in order that so far as I was able I might get some benefit from him.  I said therefore:  I addressed my question to both in common;  but if you think you could answer more creditably than he, I put the same question to you as I did to him:  do you consider philosophizing to be honorable or not?
<milestone unit="page" n="133"/><milestone unit="section" n="133a"/>Then the two striplings, overhearing us speak somewhat like this, were silent, and ceasing from their own contention they became listeners to ours.  What their lovers' sensations were, I do not know, but I myself, at any rate, was staggered;  for every time I am staggered by handsome young people.  It seemed to me, however, that my young friend too was in as great a flutter as myself;  but nevertheless he answered me in a most ambitious spirit:  Why, of course, Socrates, he said, if I should ever consider philosophizing to be shameful, I should not account myself so much as a man,
<milestone unit="section" n="133b"/>nor anyone else either who was disposed to think so.  Here he pointed to his rival lover, and spoke with a loud voice, in order that his favorite might hear every word.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Then I remarked:  So philosophizing seems to you to be honorable?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Quite so, he said.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Well now, I said;  does it seem to you possible to know whether anything is honorable or shameful without knowing what it is fundamentally?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>No, he said.
<milestone unit="section" n="133c"/>Then do you know, I went on, what philosophizing is?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Certainly I do, said he.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Then what is it?  I asked.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Why, just what Solon called it;  you know it was Solon who said:<quote type="verse"><l met="elegiac">And ever, as I older grow, I learn yet more and more;</l></quote><bibl>Solon Fr. 18</bibl>&mdash;and I agree with him that a man who intends to philosophize should in this way be ever learning something or other, whether he be younger or older, in order that he may learn as many things as possible in his life.  Now at first I felt there was something in his reply, but then, on second thoughts, I asked him whether he considered philosophy to be much learning.
<milestone unit="section" n="133d"/>To which he answered:  Certainly.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And do you consider philosophy to be merely honorable, I asked, or good as well?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Good as well, he said:  very much so.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Then do you observe this as peculiar to philosophy, or do you find it similarly in everything else?  For example, do you consider the love of athletics to be not merely honorable, but good as well, or do you not?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Whereupon he, most slily, gave a double answer:  To him my statement must be &ldquo;neither&rdquo; ;  but to you, Socrates, I acknowledge it to be both honorable and good: 
<milestone unit="section" n="133e"/>for I consider this the right view.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Then I asked him:  Well now, in athletics, do you consider that much exercise is love of athletics?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>To which he replied:  Certainly, just as in philosophizing I consider much learning to be philosophy.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Then I said:  And do you then consider that the lovers of athletics desire anything else than that which will cause them to be in good bodily condition?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Only that, he replied.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And does much exercise, I asked, cause them to be in good bodily condition?
<milestone unit="page" n="134"/><milestone unit="section" n="134a"/>Yes, for how, he replied, could one be in good bodily condition through little exercise?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Here I felt it was time to stir up the lover of athletics, in order that he might give me the support of his athletic experience;  so I proceeded to ask him:  And you then, pray, why are you silent, excellent sir, while your friend here is speaking thus?  Do you agree that men are in good bodily condition through much exercise, or is it rather through moderate exercise?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>For my part, Socrates, he said, I thought even a pig&mdash;
<milestone unit="section" n="134b"/>as the saying is&mdash;would have known that moderate exercise causes them to be in good bodily condition, so why should not a fellow who is sleepless and unfed, with unchafed neck and slender, care-worn frame!  And when he had said this the boys were delighted and laughed their approval, while the other lover blushed.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Then I said to him:  Well, do you now concede that it is neither much, nor little, but moderate exercise that causes men to be in good bodily condition?  Or do you bid defiance to the two of us on this point?
<milestone unit="section" n="134c"/>To which he answered:  Against him I should be only too glad to fight it out, and I am certain I should prove able to support the theory I have put forward, even had I put forward a weaker one;  for he is naught.  But with you I do not aim at winning an unscrupulous success;  and so I admit that not a great but a moderate amount of athletics causes good condition in men.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And what of food?  Moderate or much?  I asked.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The same applied to food, he admitted.
<milestone unit="section" n="134d"/>Then I went on and tried to compel him also to admit that everything else connected with the body when most beneficial, was the moderate thing, not the much or the little;  and he admitted that it was the moderate thing.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And now, I said, as regards the soul;  are moderate or immoderate things beneficial, as adjuncts of it?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Moderate things, he replied.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And are studies among the adjuncts of the soul?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>He admitted they were.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>So among these also it is the moderate that are beneficial, and not the much?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>He agreed.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Then whom should we be justified in asking what sort of exercise or food is moderate for the body?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The three of us agreed that it must be a doctor or a trainer.
<milestone unit="section" n="134e"/>And whom should we ask about the moderate measure in the sowing of seed?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>In that matter, we agreed, it must be a farmer.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And whom should we be justified in asking as to the moderate degree and kind, in regard to the sowing and planting of studies in the soul?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>At this point we all began to be full of perplexity; 
<milestone unit="page" n="135"/><milestone unit="section" n="135a"/>then I, mocking at them, asked:  Do you mind, since we are in perplexity, if we ask these boys here?  or perhaps we are ashamed, as Homer<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb"><title>Od</title>. xxi. 285 foll., where the suitors of Penelope are ashamed, after they have failed to string the great bow of Odysseus, to let its owner, disguised as a beggar, try his strength on it, and perhaps succeed.</note> said the suitors were, and do not think it fit there should be someone else who will string the bow?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Then, as it seemed to me that they were losing their zeal for the argument, I tried to pursue the inquiry in another way, and said:  But what, as nearly as we can guess, are the kinds of learning which the philosopher should learn, since he is not to learn all things or many things?
<milestone unit="section" n="135b"/>At this the wiser one interjected:  The finest and most suitable kinds of learning are those which will bring him the most reputation for philosophy;  and he will get most reputation if he appears well versed in all the arts, or if not in all, in as many of them, and those the most considerable, as he can, by learning so much of them as befits a free man to learn, that is, what belongs to the understanding rather than the handiwork of each.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Well now, do you mean, I asked, in the same way as in carpentry?  For there, you know, you can buy a carpenter for five
<milestone unit="section" n="135c"/>or six minae,<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">A mina(=100 drachmae)would be about 6-8 pounds in our money today.</note> but a first-rate architect cannot be got for even ten thousand drachmae;  few such, indeed, could be found throughout the whole of <placeName key="tgn,1000074">Greece</placeName>.  Is it something of this sort that you mean?  When he heard me say this, he admitted that something like this was what he himself meant.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>I next asked him if it was not impossible for the same person to learn in this way merely two of the arts, not to speak of many or the principal ones;  to which he replied:  Do not conceive me, Socrates,
<milestone unit="section" n="135d"/>to be stating that the philosopher must have accurate knowledge of each of the arts, like the actual adept in any of them;  I mean only so far as may be expected of a free and educated man:  that is, he should be able to follow the explanations of the craftsman more readily than the rest of the company, and to contribute an opinion of his own which will make him appear the cleverest and most accomplished of the company who may at any time be present at some verbal or practical exposition of the arts.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Then, as I was still unsettled in my mind as to the drift of his words, I asked him:  Do I quite grasp the sort of man whom you mean by the philosopher? 
<milestone unit="section" n="135e"/>For you seem to me to mean someone like the all-round athletes<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">Literally, athletes trained for the contest of the five exercises of leaping, running, disc-flinging, javelin-throwing, and wrestling.</note> in contest with the runners or the wrestlers:  the former yield, you know, to the latter in their particular exercises, and are their inferiors in these, but are superior to the usual sort of athletes and beat them.  I daresay it may be something of this sort that you would suggest as the effect produced by philosophy on those who make it their pursuit:  they yield to those who are first-rate
<milestone unit="page" n="136"/><milestone unit="section" n="136a"/>in an understanding of the arts, but in taking the second place they surpass the rest;  and in this way the man who has studied philosophy comes just next to the top in everything.  That is the kind of person whom you appear to me to indicate.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>You are quite right, it seems to me, Socrates, he said, in your conception of the philosopher's position, with your comparison of him to the all-round athlete.  For it is precisely his nature not to be enslaved to any business, or to work out anything exactly, so as to let his application to that one matter make him deficient in the rest,
<milestone unit="section" n="136b"/>as the craftsmen do, but to have a moderate contact with all of them.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Well, after this answer I was eager to know clearly what he meant, so I inquired of him whether he conceived of good men as useful or useless.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Useful, I should say, Socrates, he replied.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Then if good men are useful, are wicked men useless?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>He agreed that they were.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Again, do you consider that philosophers are useful persons or not?
<milestone unit="section" n="136c"/>He agreed that they were useful;  nay, more, that he considered they were most useful of all.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Come now, let us make out, if what you say is true, where these second-best men are also useful to us:  for clearly the philosopher is inferior to any particular adept in the arts.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>He agreed.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Well now, I went on, if you yourself, or one of your friends for whom you feel great concern, should have fallen sick, would you fetch that second-best man into the house with a view to obtaining health, or would you summon a doctor?
<milestone unit="section" n="136d"/>For my part, I should have both, he replied.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Please do not say &ldquo;both,&rdquo; I said, but which of the two you would prefer and also summon first.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>No one, he replied,would make any question but that the doctor should be preferred and also summoned first.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And again, if you were in a ship that was making rough weather, to which would you rather entrust yourself and yours, the pilot or the philosopher?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>I should choose the pilot.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And so it will be in everything else:  so long as there is some craftsman, the philosopher will not be useful?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Apparently, he replied.
<milestone unit="section" n="136e"/>So now we find that the philosopher is a useless person?  For I suppose we always have craftsmen;  and we have agreed that good men are useful, and bad ones useless.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>He was obliged to agree to this.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Then what follows?  Am I to ask you, or will it be too ill-mannered?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Ask whatever you please.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Well, my aim, I said, is merely to recall our agreements upon
<milestone unit="page" n="137"/><milestone unit="section" n="137a"/>what has been stated.  The matter stands somewhat like this.  We agreed that philosophy is an honorable thing, and that philosophers are good;  and that good men are useful, and wicked men useless:  but then again we agreed that philosophers, so long as we have craftsmen, are useless, and that we always do have craftsmen.  Has not all this been agreed?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Yes, to be sure, he replied.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Then we agreed, it seems, by your account&mdash;if philosophizing means having knowledge of the arts in the way you describe&mdash;that philosophers are wicked and useless so long as there are arts
<milestone unit="section" n="137b"/>among mankind.  But I expect they are not so really, my friend, and that philosophizing is not just having a concernment in the arts or spending one's life in meddlesome stooping and prying and accumulation of learning, but something else;  because I imagined that this life was actually a disgrace, and that people who concerned themselves with the arts were called sordid.<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb"><foreign lang="greek">BA/NAUSOS</foreign> expresses the peculiar contempt felt by Greek gentlemen for the work of artisans and even artists.  Manual labor was the business of slaves and persons who were unfit for military and political life.</note> But we shall know more definitely whether this statement of mine is true, if you will answer me this:  What men know how to punish horses rightly? 
<milestone unit="section" n="137c"/>Is it those who make them into the best horses, or some other men?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Those who make them into the best horses.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Or again, is it not the men who know how to make dogs into the best dogs that know also how to punish them rightly?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Yes.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Then it is the same art that makes them into the best dogs and punishes them rightly?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>It appears so to me, he replied.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Again, is the art that makes them into the best ones and punishes them rightly the same as that which knows the good and the bad ones, or is it some other?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The same, he said.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Then in the case of men also will you be prepared to agree that the art
<milestone unit="section" n="137d"/>which makes them into the best men is that which punishes them rightly and distinguishes the good and the bad ones?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Certainly, he said.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And that which does this to one, does it also to many, and that which does it to many, does it also to one?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Yes.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And so it is also with horses and everything else?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>I agree.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Then what is the knowledge which rightly punishes the licentious and law-breaking people in our cities?  Is it not judicature?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Yes.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And is it any other art than this that you call justice?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>No, only this.
<milestone unit="section" n="137e"/>And that whereby they punish rightly is that whereby they know the good and bad people?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>It is.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And whoever knows one will know many also?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Yes.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And whoever does not know many will not know one?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>I agree.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Then if one were a horse, and did not know the good and wicked horses, would one not know which sort one was oneself?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>I think not.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And if one were an ox and did not know the wicked and good oxen, would one not know which sort one was oneself?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>That is so, he said.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And so it would be, if one were a dog?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>He agreed.
<milestone unit="page" n="138"/><milestone unit="section" n="138a"/>Well now, when one is a man, and does not know the good and bad men, one surely cannot know whether one is good or wicked oneself, since one is a man also oneself?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>He granted this.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And is &ldquo;not knowing oneself&rdquo; being temperate,<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">Cf. <title>Charmides</title>(Introduction and 164)for the connection in thought and language between temperance and self-knowledge.</note> or not being temperate?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Not being temperate.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>So &ldquo;knowing oneself&rdquo; is being temperate?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>I agree, he said.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>So this is the message, it seems, of the Delphic inscription&mdash;that one is to practise temperance and justice.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>It seems so.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And it is by this same art that we know also how to punish rightly?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Yes.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Then that whereby we know how to punish rightly
<milestone unit="section" n="138b"/>is justice, and that whereby we know how to distinguish our own and others' quality is temperance?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>It seems so, he said.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Then justice and temperance are the same thing?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Apparently.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And further, it is thus, you know, that cities are well ordered&mdash;when the wrongdoers pay the penalty.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>That is true, he said.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Hence this is also statecraft.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>He concurred.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Again, when one man governs a city rightly, is he not called a despot and king?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>I agree.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And he governs by a kingly and despotic art?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>That is so.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And these arts are the same as the former?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Apparently.
<milestone unit="section" n="138c"/>Again, when a man singly governs a house aright, what is he called?  Is he not a house-manager and master?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Yes.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Then would he also govern his house well by justice, or by some other art?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>By justice.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Hence they are all the same, it seems,&mdash;king, despot, statesman, house-manager, master, and the temperate man and the just man;  and it is all one art,&mdash;the kingly, the despotic, the statesman's, the master's, the house-manager's, and justice and temperance.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>It is so, apparently, he said.
<milestone unit="section" n="138d"/>Then, if it is disgraceful in the philosopher to be unable, when a doctor speaks about the sick, either to follow his remarks or to contribute anything of his own to what is being said or done, and to be in the same case when any other of the craftsmen speaks, is it not disgraceful that he should be unable, when it is a judge or a king or some other of the persons whom we have just instanced, either to follow their words or contribute anything to their business?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>It must indeed be disgraceful, Socrates, to have nothing to contribute to subjects of such great importance!
<milestone unit="section" n="138e"/>Are we then to say, I asked, that in these matters also he is to be an all-round athlete, a second-rate man, taking the second place in all the subjects of this art&mdash;he, the philosopher&mdash;and is to be useless so long as there is one of these persons;  or that, first of all, he is to entrust his own house to nobody else and is not to take the second place in it, but is himself to judge and punish rightly, if his house is to be well managed?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>He granted me that it must be so.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Secondly, I presume, whether his friends entrust him with an arbitration, or the state charges him to determine
<milestone unit="page" n="139"/><milestone unit="section" n="139a"/>or judge any matter, it is disgraceful for him, my good friend, in such cases, to be found in the second or third place, and not to lead?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>I agree.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Hence we see, my excellent sir, that philosophizing is very far from being much learning and that affair of busying oneself with the arts.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>On my saying this the cultivated youth was silent, feeling ashamed for what he had said before, while the unlearned one said it was as I stated;  and the rest of the company praised the argument.</p></sp></body></text>

<milestone unit="page" n="121"/><milestone unit="section" n="121a"/><sp><speaker>Demodocus</speaker><p>Socrates, I was wanting to have some private talk with you, if you had time to spare;  even if there is some demand, which is not particularly important, on your time, do spare some, nevertheless, for me.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Why, in any case I happen to have time to spare, and for you, moreover, I have plenty. Well, you are free to say whatever you wish.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Demodocus</speaker><p>Then do you mind if we step aside here from the street into the portico of Zeus the Liberator<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">This portico or colonnade was near that of the King Archon, close to the Agora</note>?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>As you think best.
<milestone unit="section" n="121b"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Demodocus</speaker><p>Let us go, then. Socrates, it would seem that all growths follow the same course, both those that grow from the earth, and the animals, including man. In regard to the plants, as you know, we who cultivate the earth find it the easiest part of our work to make all our preparations that are needed before planting, and to do the planting itself;  but when the plant begins to grow, thenceforward we have a great deal of difficult and vexatious business in tending the new growth.
<milestone unit="section" n="121c"/>Such, it seems, is also the case in regard to men:  I take my own concerns as evidence for judging of the rest. For indeed I have found the planting, or the procreation&mdash;whichever one ought to call it&mdash;of this son of mine the easiest thing in the world;  but his upbringing has been vexatious and a constant source of alarm, so great are my fears for him. Among the many instances that I could mention, the desire which occupies him at the moment is a thing that especially alarms me:  for it is not an ill-bred desire, but a dangerous one, since here we have him, Socrates, as he says, desiring to become wise.
<milestone unit="section" n="121d"/>My opinion is that some of his fellow-townsmen, about his own age, who pay visits to the city, excite him with accounts of certain discussions they have heard there;  and in his envy of these he has long been pestering me with the demand that I should take due thought for his needs, and pay fees to some sophist or other who will make him wise. Now I do not mind so much about the fees, but I believe he is running into no slight danger
<milestone unit="page" n="122"/><milestone unit="section" n="122a"/>where he is hastening. I did for a time restrain him with good advice;  but since I am no longer able to do so, I believe my best course is to comply with his request, in order that he may not resort, perchance, behind my back to somebody who will corrupt him. So I have come now on this very business of placing this youth with one of these sophists, or purveyors of wisdom, as they are held to be. It is a happy chance, therefore, that has thrown you in our way, as I should be particularly glad, with this plan of action in my mind, to ask your advice. Come, if you have any advice to give
<milestone unit="section" n="122b"/>on what you have heard from me, you not only may, but should, give it.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Well, you know, Demodocus, they do say that advice is a holy thing.<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">i.e. something above and apart from the adviser's personal interests, and looking only to what is best.</note> And so, if ever it is to be accounted holy, it must be in this instance, in which you now seek it. For there is no more divine matter on which a mortal could take counsel than the education either
<milestone unit="section" n="122c"/>of himself or of his relations. Now, first of all, let you and me come to an agreement as to what we suppose that this thing can be, on which we are taking counsel;  for it may happen that I conceive it to be one thing, and you another, and then when we have proceeded some little way in our conference, we may perceive how ridiculous we are, I the adviser and you the advised, in having no common ground in our notions.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Demodocus</speaker><p>Why, I think you are right there, Socrates, and we should do as you suggest.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Yes, I am right, but yet not entirely, because I have a slight change to make. For it occurs to me that
<milestone unit="section" n="122d"/>this youngster may not be desiring the thing that we suppose him to desire, but something else, and there again we may be still more absurdly taking counsel on some other thing. Hence our most proper course, it seems to me, is to begin with the youth himself, and inquire of him what it actually is that he desires.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Demodocus</speaker><p>It does rather look, in fact, as though our best way would be thus, as you suggest.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then tell me, what is the young person's goodly name:  how are we to address him?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Demodocus</speaker><p>Theages is his name, Socrates.
<milestone unit="section" n="122e"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Goodly is the name, Demodocus, and holy-sounding,<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">&ldquo;Theages&rdquo; means &ldquo;god-guided.&rdquo;</note> that you have bestowed on your son. Tell me, then, Theages, do you say you desire to become wise, and do you require your father here to find out a school of some man who is qualified to make you wise?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theages</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And which sort of man do you call wise, those who have knowledge of such and such a thing, whatever it may be, or those who have not?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theages</speaker><p>Those who have knowledge, I say.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Well now, has not your father taught and educated you in the subjects which form the education of everyone else here&mdash;all the sons of noble and honorable fathers&mdash;in letters, I mean, and harping and wrestling and the other sorts of contest?
<milestone unit="page" n="123"/><milestone unit="section" n="123a"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Theages</speaker><p>Yes, he has.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And you think you are still lacking in some knowledge which it behoves your father to provide for you?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theages</speaker><p>I do</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>What knowledge is it? Tell us on our side, that we may oblige you.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theages</speaker><p>He knows it, as well as I, Socrates, since I have often told him;  only he says this to you of set purpose, making as if he did not know what I desire. For he assails me too with other statements of the same sort, and refuses to place me with any instructor.
<milestone unit="section" n="123b"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Well, what you said to him before was spoken, as it were, without witnesses;  but now you shall take me as a witness, and declare before me what is this wisdom that you desire. Come now;  suppose you desired the wisdom whereby men steer a ship, and I happened to put this further question to you:  Theages, what wisdom is it that you lack, when you blame your father for refusing to place you with people who would enable you to become wise? What answer would you have given me? What wisdom would you name? The steersman's art, would you not?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theages</speaker><p>Yes.
<milestone unit="section" n="123c"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And if a desire to be wise in the wisdom whereby they steer chariots led you to blame your father, and I asked what wisdom this was, what would you name in reply? The charioteer's art, would you not?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theages</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And is that which you happen to be desiring now a nameless one, or has it a name?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theages</speaker><p>I should say it has a name.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Now do you know it, though not its name, or do you know its name as well?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theages</speaker><p>I know its name as well.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then what is it? Tell me.
<milestone unit="section" n="123d"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Theages</speaker><p>What other name, Socrates, can one give it but wisdom?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And the driver's art too is wisdom? Or do you think it is ignorance?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theages</speaker><p>I do not.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>You call it wisdom?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theages</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>What use do we make of it? Is it not the art whereby we know how to govern a team of horses?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theages</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And the steersman's art too is wisdom?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theages</speaker><p>I think so.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Is not this the art whereby we know how to govern ships?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theages</speaker><p>Yes, it is.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And the wisdom that you so desire, what is it?
<milestone unit="section" n="123e"/>That whereby we know how to govern whom?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theages</speaker><p>To govern men, I imagine.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Sick men, do you mean?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theages</speaker><p>Oh, no.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>For that is medicine, is it not?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theages</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Well, that whereby we know how to govern the singers in a chorus?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theages</speaker><p>No.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>For that is music?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theages</speaker><p>To be sure.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Well, that whereby we know how to govern men in gymnastic training?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theages</speaker><p>No.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>For that is gymnastics?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theages</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Well, to govern people who do what? Endeavor your best to speak, as I did to you at the beginning.
<milestone unit="page" n="124"/><milestone unit="section" n="124a"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Theages</speaker><p>To govern the people in the city, I imagine.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And are the sick people also in the city?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theages</speaker><p>Yes, but I mean not these only, but all the rest who are in the city besides.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Do I understand what art it is that you mean? For you strike me as meaning, not that whereby we know how to govern reapers and harvesters and planters and sowers and threshers, for it is the farmer's art whereby we govern these, is it not?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theages</speaker><p>Yes.
<milestone unit="section" n="124b"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Nor, I suppose, do you mean that whereby we know how to govern sawyers and borers and planers and turners, as a class together;  for is not that carpentry?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theages</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>But perhaps it is that whereby we govern, not only all these, but farmers themselves also, and carpenters, and all craftsmen and ordinary people, whether men or women:  that, perhaps, is the wisdom you mean.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theages</speaker><p>That, Socrates, is what I have been intending to mean all the time.
<milestone unit="section" n="124c"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then can you tell me whether Aegisthus, who slew Agamemnon in <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName>, governed all these people that you mean craftsmen and ordinary people, both men and women, or some other persons?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theages</speaker><p>No, just those.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Well now, did not Peleus, son of Aeacus, govern these same people in <placeName key="perseus,Phthia">Phthia</placeName>?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theages</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And have you ever heard of Periander, son of Cypselus, and how he governed at <placeName key="perseus,Corinth">Corinth</placeName>?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theages</speaker><p>I have.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Did he not govern these same people in his city?
<milestone unit="section" n="124d"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Theages</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Or again, do you not consider that Archelaus, son of Perdiccas, who governed recently in <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName>, governed these same people?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theages</speaker><p>I do.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And who do you think were governed by Hippias, son of Peisistratus, who governed in this city? Were they not these people ?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theages</speaker><p>To be sure they were.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Now, can you tell me what appellation is given to Bacis and Sibyl and our native Amphilytus?<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">In Aristophanes and Plato we find mention of only one &ldquo;Sibyl&rdquo; : later the name, like Bacis (an old Boeotian prophet), was applied to several oracular persons in different places.

<milestone unit="section" n="124e"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>That is correct. But try to answer me in that way regarding those others&mdash;Hippias and Periander:  what appellation is given them on account of their government?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theages</speaker><p>Despots, I suppose;  it must be that.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And when a man desires to govern the whole of the people in his city, he desires the same government as those did&mdash;despotism, and to be a despot?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theages</speaker><p>Apparently.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And it is this that you say you desire?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theages</speaker><p>It seems so, from what I have said.
<milestone unit="page" n="125"/><milestone unit="section" n="125a"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>You scoundrel! So you were desiring to govern us, all the time that you were blaming your father for not sending you to some seminary of despots! And you, Demodocus, are you not ashamed of having known all the time what he is desiring, and though you could have sent him where you would have made him an expert in the wisdom which he desires, actually grudging it to him and refusing to send him? But now, look here, as he has declared against you in my presence, shall you and I consult together on the question of whose school we shall send him to, and whose classes will help him to become a wise despot?
<milestone unit="section" n="125b"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Demodocus</speaker><p>Yes, in faith, Socrates, let us certainly consult, as I feel this is a matter on which no slight counsel is needed.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>By and by, my good sir. Let us first cross-examine him thoroughly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Demodocus</speaker><p>Examine him then.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Well now, what if we called in Euripides to our aid, Theages?

<milestone unit="section" n="126b"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then what if you chanced to desire to become wise in horsemanship? To whom would you have had to resort before expecting to be a clever horseman? To whom else but the horse-masters?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theages</speaker><p>To none else, I am sure.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And moreover, you would go to the actual men who are clever at the business, and who have horses and constantly use them in great numbers, both their own and other people's?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theages</speaker><p>Obviously I should.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And what if you wished to become wise in javelin-throwing?

Or do you think to get wisdom in their business by resorting to any other persons than these particular men?
<milestone unit="section" n="126d"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Theages</speaker><p>Well, Socrates, I have heard of the argument that you are said to put forward&mdash;that the sons of those statesmen are no better men than the sons of shoemakers<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">Cf. <title>Alcib. I</title>.118 E;<title>Protag</title> 320 A, B.</note>;  and in my opinion your words are very true, from what I am able to gather. Hence I should be an utter fool if I supposed that any of these men would impart his wisdom to me when he never was of any use to his own son, as he would have been, if he were able to be of use in this matter to anyone at all in the world.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then which way, most excellent sir, would you turn if, when you came to have a son, he should trouble you in the same manner,
<milestone unit="section" n="126e"/>and tell you he desired to become a good painter, and should blame you, his father, for refusing to spend money on him for that very purpose, but at the same time should disregard the practitioners of that very thing, the painters, and decline to learn from them? Or the flute-players, when he wished to become a flute-player, or the harp-players? Would you know what to do with him, and where else you should send him if he refused to learn from these?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theages</speaker><p>Upon my word, I should not.
<milestone unit="page" n="127"/><milestone unit="section" n="127a"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And do you now, when you are behaving in just the same way to your father, feel surprised and blame him for being at a loss what to do with you and where to send you? Why, we are ready to place you with any well-bred Athenian statesman you may choose, who will train you free of charge<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">Cf. the passage in the <title>Protagoras</title>(320 A, B)which shows that young men of good family were often placed with older friends of standing and experience in order to prepare for public life. Cf. also <title>Meno</title> 94 D.</note>;  and so not only will you be at no expense of money, but will gain far greater commendation amongst the mass of men than if you studied with anyone else.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theages</speaker><p>But then, Socrates, are not you too one of our well-bred gentlemen? Indeed, if you will agree to instruct me, I am content and seek no other.
<milestone unit="section" n="127b"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>What do you mean by that, Theages?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Demodocus</speaker><p>Nay, Socrates, there is nothing amiss in what he says, and you will oblige me at the same time;  for I should count it the greatest possible stroke of luck if he should welcome your instruction and you also should consent to instruct him. Nay, indeed, I am quite ashamed to say how keenly I wish it;  but I entreat you both&mdash;you, to consent to teach Theages, and you, to seek the teaching of no one else than Socrates;  you will thus relieve me
<milestone unit="section" n="127c"/>of a harassing load of anxiety. For just now I am sorely afraid of his falling in with some other person who is likely to corrupt him.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theages</speaker><p>Have no more fears for me now, father, so long as you are able to persuade him to receive me as his pupil.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Demodocus</speaker><p>Very rightly spoken. Socrates, from now onward we must address ourselves to you;  for I am ready, in short, to place both myself and all that I hold dearest of what is mine in your hands&mdash;whatever you may require,
<milestone unit="section" n="127d"/>absolutely&mdash;if you will open your arms to Theages here, and do him any service that you can.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Demodocus, your zeal is no wonder to me, if you suppose that I especially could be of use to him;  for I know of nothing for which a sensible man could be more zealous than for his own son's utmost improvement. But how you came to form this opinion, that I would be better able to be of use to your son in his aim of becoming a good citizen than you would yourself, and how he came to suppose that I rather than yourself would be of use to him&mdash;this does fill me with wonder. For you,
<milestone unit="section" n="127e"/>in the first place, are my elder, and further, you have held in your time many of the highest offices in <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, and are respected by the people of Anagyrus<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">A deme or township of <placeName key="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName>.</note> above all your fellow-townsmen, and by the whole state as much as any man, whereas neither of you can notice anything like this about me. And moreover, if Theages here does despise the instruction of our statesmen, and is looking for some other persons who profess to be able to educate young people, we have here Prodicus of <placeName key="tgn,7010867">Ceos</placeName>, Gorgias of Leontini, Polus of <placeName key="tgn,7003808">Acragas</placeName>,
<milestone unit="page" n="128"/><milestone unit="section" n="128a"/>and many more, who are so wise that they go to our cities and persuade the noblest and wealthiest of our young men&mdash;who have the choice of learning from any citizen they choose, free of charge&mdash;they persuade them to abandon that instruction and learn from them, with a deposit, besides, of a large sum of money as their fee, and to feel thankful in addition. Some of these persons might naturally have been chosen both by your son and by yourself, in preference to me; 
<milestone unit="section" n="128b"/>for I have no knowledge of those fair and beatific subjects of study:  I only wish that I had. But what I always say, you know, is that I am in the position of knowing practically nothing except one little subject, that of love-matters. In this subject, however, I claim to be skilled above anybody who has ever lived or is now living in the world.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theages</speaker><p>Do you see, father? Socrates does not seem to me to be at all willing now to spend his time on me;  for there is readiness enough on my part,
<milestone unit="section" n="128c"/>if he is willing. But he is only jesting in what he has just told us. For I know of some of my equals in age, and some a little older, who were of no account before they learnt from him, but after beginning to learn from him have in a very short time proved themselves superior to all whose inferiors they were before.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And do you know what the meaning of it is, son of Demodocus?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theages</speaker><p>Yes, on my soul, I do&mdash;that, if it be your pleasure, I too shall be able to become such as those others are.
<milestone unit="section" n="128d"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>No, good sir, the meaning of it escapes you;  but I will tell it you. There is something spiritual which, by a divine dispensation, has accompanied me from my childhood up. It is a voice that, when it occurs, always indicates to me a prohibition of something I may be about to do, but never urges me on to anything;  and if one of my friends consults me and the voice occurs, the same thing happens:  it prohibits, and does not allow him to act. And I will produce witnesses to convince you of these facts. You know our Charmides here, who has grown so handsome, the son of Glaucon: 
<milestone unit="section" n="128e"/>he once happened to be consulting me on his intention of training for the Nemean races, and he had no sooner begun to say that he intended to train than the voice occurred, and I tried to prevent him, saying&mdash;&ldquo;Just as you were speaking my spirit-voice has occurred:  no, you must not train.&rdquo;  &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;it indicates to you that I shall not win;  but even if I am not to win, at any rate the exercise I shall get in the meantime will do me good.&rdquo; So saying, he went and trained;  and so you may as well inquire of him
<milestone unit="page" n="129"/><milestone unit="section" n="129a"/>as to the results he got from his training. Or if you like, ask Cleitomachus, brother of Timarchus, what Timarchus said to him when he was going straight to the prison to meet his death, he and Euathlus the racing runner, who had harbored Timarchus as a fugitive;  for he will tell you that the words he spoke to him were these:</p></sp><sp><speaker>Theages</speaker><p>What?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>  &ldquo;Cleitomachus,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I tell you I am going to my death now, because I would not take Socrates' advice.&rdquo; Now, why on earth did Timarchus say that? I will tell you. When Timarchus and Philemon,
<milestone unit="section" n="129b"/>son of Philemonides, got up from the wine-party to kill Nicias, son of Heroscamandrus, those two alone had knowledge of the plot;  and Timarchus, as he got up, said to me: &ldquo;What say you, Socrates? Go on drinking, all of you;  I have to get up and go somewhere, but I will join you a little later, if I get the chance.&rdquo; Then occurred that voice of mine, and I said to him: &ldquo;No, no, do not get up;  for my accustomed spiritual sign has occurred to me.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="section" n="129c"/>So he stopped. Then after an interval of time he again started to go, and said: &ldquo;Well, I am going, Socrates.&rdquo; Again the voice occurred, and so again I constrained him to stop. The third time, wishing to give me the slip, he got up without saying another word to me;  he gave me the slip by watching until my attention was turned elsewhere. Thus it was that he went right off and committed the deed which was the cause of his going then to his death. And hence it was that he spoke those words to his brother which I quoted to you just now, that he was going to his death because he had not taken my advice.
<milestone unit="section" n="129d"/>And moreover, in regard to the Sicilian business,<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">The disastrous Sicilian expedition of <dateRange from="-415" to="-413">415</dateRange>-413 B.C.  Cf. Thuc. vi. and vii.</note> many will tell you what I said about the destruction of the army. As to bygones, you may hear from those who know:  but there is an opportunity now of testing the worth of what the sign says. For as the handsome Sannio was setting out on campaign, the sign occurred to me, and he has gone now with Thrasyllus on an expedition bound for <placeName key="tgn,7002499">Ephesus</placeName> and <placeName key="tgn,6002765">Ionia</placeName>.<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb"><date value="-409">409</date> B.C., when Thrasyllus succeeded in recovering <placeName key="perseus,Colophon">Colophon</placeName> for <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>.  He was one of the commanders put to death by the Athenians after the battle of Arginusae, <date value="-406">406</date> B.C.</note> I accordingly expect him to be either killed or brought very near it, and I have great fears for our force as a whole.
<milestone unit="section" n="129e"/><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now I have told you all this, because this spiritual power that attends me also exerts itself to the full in my intercourse with those who spend their time with me. To many, indeed, it is adverse, and it is not possible for these to get any good by conversing with me, and I am therefore unable to spend my time in conversing with them. And there are many with whom it does not prohibit my intercourse, yet the intercourse does them no good. But those who are assisted in their intercourse by that spiritual power are the persons whom you have noticed;  for they make rapid progress there and then. And of these, again, who make progress some find the benefit
<milestone unit="page" n="130"/><milestone unit="section" n="130a"/>both solid and enduring;  while there are many who, for as long a time as they are with me, make wonderful progress, but when they are parted from me relapse, and are no different from anybody else. This once befell Aristeides,<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">Cf. <title>Theaet</title>. 151 A, from which this passage is derived.  The Aristeides and Thucydides mentioned here were the grandsons respectively of Aristeides, the Athenian statesman of the time of the Persian wars, and of Thucydides, the aristocratic opponent of Pericles. Their fathers Lysimachus and Melesias appear in the <title>Laches</title>.</note> son of Lysimachus, son of Aristeides. For by conversing with me he had made immense progress in a little time;  and then he had to go on an expedition, and he went and sailed away. On his return he found that Thucydides, son of Melesias, son of Thucydides, had been conversing with me. Now Thucydides, the day before, had quarrelled with me
<milestone unit="section" n="130b"/>over some arguments we had had. So when Aristeides saw me, after greeting me and talking of other affairs, he said: &ldquo;But Thucydides, I hear, Socrates, is somewhat on his dignity with you, and is annoyed as though he were somebody. &ldquo;Yes, that is so,&rdquo; I replied. &ldquo;Well, but does he not know,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;what a sad slave he was, before he associated with you?&rdquo;  &ldquo;It seems not,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;upon my soul.&rdquo;  &ldquo;But indeed I myself also,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;am in a ridiculous position,
<milestone unit="section" n="130c"/>Socrates.&rdquo;  &ldquo;How exactly?&rdquo; I asked. &ldquo;Because,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;before I sailed away, I was able to discuss things with anybody, and show myself inferior to none in argument, so that I even sought out the debates of the most accomplished people:  but now, on the contrary, I shun them, wherever I notice there is anyone of education, so ashamed I am of my own ineptitude.&rdquo;  &ldquo;Tell me,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;did this power forsake you of a sudden, or little by little?&rdquo;  &ldquo;Little by little,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;And when it was present with you,&rdquo; I asked,
<milestone unit="section" n="130d"/>&ldquo;was it present through your having learnt something from me, or in some other way?&rdquo;  &ldquo;I will tell you, Socrates,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;what is incredible, upon my soul, yet true. For I never yet learnt anything from you, as you know yourself:  but I made progress, whenever I was with you, if I was merely in the same house, without being in the same room, but more progress, when I was in the same room. And it seemed to me to be much more when I was in the same room and looked at you as you were speaking, than when
<milestone unit="section" n="130e"/>I turned my eyes elsewhere:  but my progress was far the greatest and most marked whenever I sat beside you and held and touched you. Now, however,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that condition has all oozed away.&rdquo;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Such then, Theages, is the intercourse you would have with me:  if God so wills, you will make very great and rapid progress, but otherwise, you will not. Consider, therefore, if it is not safer for you to be educated by one of those persons who have command themselves of the benefit which they bestow on mankind, rather than follow the course on which you may chance with me.
<milestone unit="page" n="131"/><milestone unit="section" n="131a"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Theages</speaker><p>Well then, I decide, Socrates, that our plan shall be to make trial of that spiritual sign by associating with each other. Thus, if it leaves us free, that will be best of all;  if it does not, it will be time then for us to consider, at the moment, what we shall do&mdash;whether we shall associate with someone else, or try to conciliate the divine sign itself that occurs to you with prayers and sacrifices and anything else that the seers may indicate.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Demodocus</speaker><p>In view of this, Socrates, say no more in opposition to the lad;  for Theages is right in what he says.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Well, if you consider that this is what we ought to do, let us do it.</p></sp></body></text>

In the next year an Athenian force met and fought a Peloponnesian force at <placeName key="tgn,6004814">Potidaea</placeName>, and then laid siege to the city.  Thus began the Peloponnesian War.</note> and I sought with delight, after an absence of some time, my wonted conversations.  Accordingly I went into the wrestling-school of Taureas,<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">A professional trainer.</note> opposite the Queen's shrine,<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">There was a shrine of Basile, or the Queen (of whom nothing is known), some way to the south of the Acropolis.  Cf. Fraser, <title>Pausanias</title> ii. p. 203.</note> and there I came upon quite a number of people, some of whom were unknown to me, but most of whom I knew.  And as soon as they saw me
<milestone unit="section" n="153b"/>appear thus unexpectedly, they hailed me from a distance on every side;  but Chaerephon, like the mad creature that he is, jumped up from their midst and ran to me, and grasping me by the hand&mdash;<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Socrates, he said, how did you survive the battle?  (Shortly before we came away there had been a battle at <placeName key="tgn,6004814">Potidaea</placeName>, of which the people here had only just had news.)<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>In the state in which you see me, I replied.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>It has been reported here, you know, said he, that the battle was very
<milestone unit="section" n="153c"/>severe, and that many of our acquaintance have lost their lives in it.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Then the report, I replied, is pretty near the truth.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>You were present, he asked, at the fighting?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>I was present.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Then sit down here, he said, and give us a full account;  for as yet we have had no clear report of it all.  And with that he led me to a seat by Critias, son of Callaeschrus.  So I sat down there and greeted Critias and the rest, and gave them all the news from the battlefield, in answer to their various questions;  each had his inquiry to make.
<milestone unit="section" n="153d"/>When we had had enough of such matters, I in my turn began to inquire about affairs at home, how philosophy was doing at present, and whether any of the rising young men had distinguished themselves for wisdom or beauty or both.  Then Critias, looking towards the door,
<milestone unit="page" n="154"/><milestone unit="section" n="154a"/>for he saw some young fellows who were coming in with some railing at each other, and a crowd of people following on behind them, said&mdash;Concerning the beauties, Socrates, I expect you will get your knowledge at once:  for these who are coming in are in fact forerunners and lovers of the person who is held, for the moment at least, to be the greatest beauty;  and he himself, I imagine, must by now be nearly upon us.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Who is he, I asked, and whose son?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>You must know, he replied, but he was not yet grown up when you went away,&mdash;Charmides, son of
<milestone unit="section" n="154b"/>our uncle Glaucon, and my cousin.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>I do know, to be sure, I said;  for he was not to be despised even then, when he was still a child, and now, I suppose, he will be quite a youth by this time.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>You will know this moment, he said, both how much and to what purpose he has grown.  And just as he spoke these words, Charmides entered.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now I, my good friend, am no measurer:  I am a mere &ldquo;white line&rdquo;<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">A white or chalked line was proverbially useless for marking off measurements on white stone or marble.</note> in measuring beautiful people, for almost everyone who has just grown up appears beautiful to me.  Nay and this time, moreover, the young man appeared to me
<milestone unit="section" n="154c"/>a marvel of stature and beauty;  and all the rest, to my thinking, were in love with him, such was their astonishment and confusion when he came in, and a number of other lovers were following in his train.  On the part of men like us it was not so surprising;  but when I came to observe the boys I noticed that none of them, not even the smallest, had eyes for anything else, but that
<milestone unit="section" n="154d"/>they all gazed at him as if he were a statue.  Then Chaerephon called me and said&mdash;How does the youth strike you, Socrates?  Has he not a fine face?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Immensely so, I replied.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Yet if he would consent to strip, he said, you would think he had no face, he has such perfect beauty of form.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And these words of Chaerephon were repeated by the rest.  Then,&mdash;By Heracles! I said, what an irresistible person you make him out to be, if he has but one more thing&mdash;a little thing&mdash;besides.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>What? said Critias.
<milestone unit="section" n="154e"/>If in his soul, I replied, he is of good grain.  And I should think, Critias, he ought to be, since he is of your house.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Ah, he said, he is right fair and good in that way also.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Why then, I said, let us strip that very part of him and view it first, instead of his form;  for anyhow, at that age, I am sure he is quite ready to have a discussion.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Very much so, said Critias;  for, I may say, he is in fact
<milestone unit="page" n="155"/><milestone unit="section" n="155a"/>a philosopher, and also&mdash;as others besides himself consider&mdash;quite a poet.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>That, my dear Critias, I said, is a gift which your family has had a long while back, through your kinship with Solon.  But why not call the young man here and show him to me?  For surely, even if he were younger still, there could be no discredit in our having a talk with him before you, who are at once his guardian and his cousin.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>You are quite right he said, and we will call him.
<milestone unit="section" n="155b"/>Thereupon he said to his attendant,&mdash;Boy, call Charmides;  tell him I want him to see a doctor about the ailment with which he told me he was troubled yesterday.  Then, turning to me,&mdash;You know, he has spoken lately of having a headache, said Critias, on getting up in the morning:  now why should you not represent to him that you know a cure for headache?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Why not? I said:  only he must come.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Oh, he will be here, he said.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And so it was;  for he came, and caused much laughter, because each of us who were seated
<milestone unit="section" n="155c"/>made room for him by pushing hard at his neighbor so as to have him sitting beside himself, until at either end of the seat one had to stand up, and we tumbled the other off sideways;  and he came and sat down between me and Critias.  But here, my friend, I began to feel perplexed, and my former confidence in looking forward to a quite easy time in talking with him had been knocked out of me.  And when, on Critias telling him that it was I who knew the cure,
<milestone unit="section" n="155d"/>he gave me such a look with his eyes as passes description, and was just about to plunge into a question, and when all the people in the wrestling-school surged round about us on every side&mdash;then, ah then, my noble friend, I saw inside his cloak and caught fire, and could possess myself no longer;  and I thought none was so wise in love-matters as Cydias,<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">A poet classed with Mimnermus and Archilochus by Plutarch;  cf. Bergk, <title>Poet. Lyr.</title>2 p. 960.</note> who in speaking of a beautiful boy recommends someone to &ldquo;beware of coming as a fawn before the lion, and being seized as his portion of flesh&rdquo;;  for I too felt
<milestone unit="section" n="155e"/>I had fallen a prey to some such creature.  However, when he had asked me if I knew the cure for headache, I somehow contrived to answer that I knew.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Then what is it? he asked.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>So I told him that the thing itself was a certain leaf, but there was a charm to go with the remedy;  and if one uttered the charm at the moment of its application, the remedy made one perfectly well;  but without the charm there was no efficacy in the leaf.
<milestone unit="page" n="156"/><milestone unit="section" n="156a"/>Then I will take down the charm, said he, from you in writing.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Do you prefer, I asked, to get my consent first, or to do without it?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>This made him laugh, and he said:  To get your consent, Socrates.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Very well, I said;  and are you certain of my name?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Unless I misjudge, he replied;  for there is no little talk of you.  among the set of our age, and I remember as a mere child the sight of you in company with Critias here.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>That is a good thing, I said:  for I shall speak more freely to you
<milestone unit="section" n="156b"/>about the charm, and its real nature;  just now I was at a loss for the way to apprise you of its power.  For it is of such a nature, Charmides, that it cannot cure the head alone;  I daresay you have yourself sometimes heard good doctors say, you know, when a patient comes to them with a pain in his eyes, that it is not possible for them to attempt a cure of his eyes alone, but that it is necessary to treat his head too at the same time,
<milestone unit="section" n="156c"/>if he is to have his eyes in good order;  and so again, that to expect ever to treat the head by itself, apart from the body as a whole, is utter folly.  And on this principle they apply their regimen to the whole body, and attempt to treat and heal the part along with the whole;  or have you not observed that this is what they say, and is done in fact?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Certainly I have, he said.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And you consider it well said, and accept the principle?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Most assuredly, he said.
<milestone unit="section" n="156d"/>Then I, on hearing his approval, regained my courage;  and little by little I began to muster up my confidence again, and my spirit began to rekindle.  So I said,&mdash;Such, then, Charmides, is the nature of this charm.  I learnt it on campaign over there, from one of the Thracian physicians of Zalmoxis,<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">A legendary hero of the Thracian race of the Getae;  cf. <bibl n="Hdt. 4.94">Hdt. 4.94-6</bibl>.</note> who are said even to make one immortal.  This Thracian said that the Greeks were right in advising as I told you just now:  &ldquo;but Zalmoxis,&rdquo; he said,
<milestone unit="section" n="156e"/>&ldquo;our king, who is a god, says that as you ought not to attempt to cure eyes without head, or head without body, so you should not treat body without soul&rdquo;;  and this was the reason why most maladies evaded the physicians of Greece&mdash;that they neglected the whole, on which they ought to spend their pains, for if this were out of order it was impossible for the part to be in order.  For all that was good and evil, he said, in the body and in man altogether was sprung from the soul, and flowed along from thence as it did
<milestone unit="page" n="157"/><milestone unit="section" n="157a"/>from the head into the eyes.  Wherefore that part was to be treated first and foremost, if all was to be well with the head and the rest of the body.  And the treatment of the soul, so he said, my wonderful friend, is by means of certain charms, and these charms are words of the right sort:  by the use of such words is temperance engendered in our souls, and as soon as it is engendered and present we may easily secure health to the head and to the rest of the body also.
<milestone unit="section" n="157b"/>Now in teaching me the remedy and the charms he remarked,&mdash;&rdquo; Let nobody persuade you to treat his head with this remedy, unless he has first submitted his soul for you to treat with the charm.  For at present,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the cure of mankind is beset with the error of certain doctors who attempt to practise the one method without the other.&rdquo; And he most particularly enjoined on me not to let anyone, however wealthy or noble or handsome,
<milestone unit="section" n="157c"/>induce me to disobey him.  So I, since I have given him my oath, and must obey him, will do as he bids;  and if you agree to submit your soul first to the effect of the Thracian charms, according to the stranger's injunctions, I will apply the remedy to your head:  otherwise we shall be at a loss what to do with you, my dear Charmides.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Then Critias, when he heard me say this, remarked,&mdash;This affection of the head, Socrates, will turn out to be a stroke of luck for the young man, if he is to be compelled
<milestone unit="section" n="157d"/>on account of his head to improve his understanding also.  However, let me tell you, Charmides is considered to excel his comrades not only in appearance, but also in that very thing which you say is produced by your charm:  temperance, you say it is, do you not?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Certainly, I replied.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Then be assured, he said, that he is considered to be far and away the most temperate person now alive, while in every other respect, for a youth of his age, he is second to none.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Why, yes, I said, and it is only right, Charmides, that you should excel the rest in all these respects; for
<milestone unit="section" n="157e"/>I do not suppose there is anyone else here who could readily point to a case of any two Athenian houses uniting together which would be likely to produce handsomer or nobler offspring than those from which you are sprung.  For your father's house, which comes from Critias, son of Dropides, has been celebrated by Anacreon and Solon and many other poets, so that it is famed by tradition among us as preeminent in beauty and virtue
<milestone unit="page" n="158"/><milestone unit="section" n="158a"/>and all else that is accounted happiness;  and then, your mother's house is famous in the same way, for of Pyrilampes, your uncle, it is said that no one in all the continent was considered to be his superior in beauty or stature, whenever he came as envoy to the great king or anyone else in <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>, and his house as a whole is no whit inferior to the other.  Sprung from such people, it is to be supposed that you would be first in all things.  And indeed,
<milestone unit="section" n="158b"/>as regards your visible form, dear son of Glaucon, I consider that nowhere have you fallen behind any of your ancestors.  But if your nature is really rich in temperance and those other things, as our friend here says, blessed is the son, dear Charmides, I exclaimed, that your mother has borne in you!  However, the case stands thus:  if you already possess temperance, as Critias here declares, and you are sufficiently temperate, then you never had any need of the charms of Zalmoxis or of Abaris the Hyperborean,<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">A fabulous hero of the far north, to whom oracles and charms were ascribed by the Greeks;  cf. <bibl n="Hdt. 4.36">Hdt. 4.36</bibl>.</note>
<milestone unit="section" n="158c"/>and might well be given at once the remedy for the head;  but if you prove to be still lacking that virtue, we must apply the charm before the remedy.  So tell me yourself whether you agree with our friend, and can say that you are already sufficiently provided with temperance, or are deficient in it?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>At this Charmides blushed and, for one thing, looked more beautiful then ever, for his modesty became his years;  and then, too, he answered most ingenuously, saying it was no easy matter at the moment either to admit or to deny the words of the question.  For if,
<milestone unit="section" n="158d"/>he went on, I say I am not temperate, not only is it a strange thing to say against oneself, but I shall at the same time be taxing with untruth both Critias and many others who consider me to be temperate, as he gives out;  while if, on the other hand, I say I am, and praise myself, it will probably be found distasteful;  so that I cannot see what answer I am to give you.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Then I said:  Your answer is a natural one, in my opinion, Charmides;  and I think, I went on, that we must join in inquiring whether you possess the thing I am asking after, or not, in order that
<milestone unit="section" n="158e"/>neither you may be forced to say what you do not wish, nor I on my part may recklessly try my hand at medicine.  So if it is agreeable to you, I am ready to inquire with you;  but, if it is not, to let it alone.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Why, nothing, he said, could be more agreeable to me :  so far as that goes, therefore, inquire in whatever way you think we had better proceed.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Then this is the way, I said, in which I consider that our inquiry into this matter had best be conducted.  Now, it is clear that, if you
<milestone unit="page" n="159"/><milestone unit="section" n="159a"/>have temperance with you, you can hold an opinion about it.  For being in you, I presume it must, in that case, afford some perception from which you can form some opinion of what temperance is, and what kind of thing it is :  do you not think so ?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>I do, he replied.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And since you understand the Greek tongue, I said, you can tell me, I suppose, your view of this particular thought of yours?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>I daresay, he said.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Then in order that we may make a guess whether it is in you or not, tell me, I said, what you say of temperance according to your opinion.
<milestone unit="section" n="159b"/>He at first hung back, and was not at all willing to answer:  but presently he said that, to his mind, temperance was doing everything orderly and quietly&mdash;walking in the streets, talking, and doing everything else of that kind;  and in a word, he said, I think the thing about which you ask may be called quietness.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Well, I said, are you right there?  They do say, you know, Charmides, that quiet people are temperate :  so let us see if there is anything in what they say.  Tell me, is not temperance,
<milestone unit="section" n="159c"/>however, among the honorable things?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>To be sure, he said.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Well, which is most honorable at the writing master's, to write the same sort of letters quickly or quietly?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Quickly.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And in reading, to do it quickly or slowly?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Quickly.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And so, in the same way, to play the lyre quickly, or to wrestle nimbly, is far more honorable than to do it quietly and slowly?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Yes.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And what of boxing, alone or combined with wrestling? Is it not the same there too?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>To be sure.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And in running and leaping and all activities
<milestone unit="section" n="159d"/>of the body, are not nimble and quick movements accounted honorable, while sluggish and quiet ones are deemed disgraceful?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Apparently.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>So we find, I said, that in the body, at least, it is not quietness, but the greatest quickness and nimbleness that is most honorable, do we not?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Certainly.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And temperance was an honorable thing?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Yes.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Then in the body, at least, it is not quietness but quickness that will be the more temperate thing, since temperance is honorable.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>So it seems, he said.
<milestone unit="section" n="159e"/>Well now, I went on;  in learning, is facility the more honorable, or difficulty?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Facility.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And facility in learning, I said, is learning quickly, and difficulty in learning is learning quietly and slowly?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Yes.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And is it not more honorable to teach another quickly and forcibly, rather than quietly and slowly?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Yes.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Well now, is it more honorable to be reminded and to remember quietly and slowly, or forcibly and quickly?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Forcibly, he replied, and quickly.
<milestone unit="page" n="160"/><milestone unit="section" n="160a"/>And is not readiness of mind a sort of nimbleness of the soul, not a quietness?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>True.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And to apprehend what is said, whether at the writing-master's or the lyre-master's or anywhere else, not as quietly as possible, but as quickly, is most honorable?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Yes.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Well, and in the searchings of the soul, and in deliberation, it is not the quietest person, I imagine, or he who deliberates and discovers with difficulty, that is held worthy of praise, but he who does this most easily and quickly.
<milestone unit="section" n="160b"/>That is so, he said.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Then in all, I said, Charmides, that concerns either our soul or our body, actions of quickness and nimbleness are found to be more honorable than those of slowness and quietness?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>It looks like it, he said.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>So temperance cannot be a sort of quietness, nor can the temperate life be quiet, by this argument at least;  since, being temperate, it must be honorable.
<milestone unit="section" n="160c"/>For we have these two alternatives:  either in no cases, or I should think in very few, can we find that the quiet actions in life are more honorable than the quick and vigorous ones;  or at all events, my friend, if of the more honorable actions there are absolutely as many quiet ones as forcible and quick, not even so will temperance be acting quietly any more than acting forcibly and quickly, either in walking or in talking or in any other sphere;  nor will the quiet life be more temperate than the unquiet;  since
<milestone unit="section" n="160d"/>in our argument we assumed that temperance is an honorable thing, and have found that quick things are just as honorable as quiet things.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Your statement, he said, Socrates, seems to me to be correct.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Once more then, I went on, Charmides, attend more closely and look into yourself;  reflect on the quality that is given you by the presence of temperance, and what quality it must have to work this effect on you.  Take stock of all this and tell me, like a good, brave fellow, what it appears to you to be.
<milestone unit="section" n="160e"/>He paused a little, and after a quite manly effort of self-examination:  Well, I think, he said, that temperance makes men ashamed or bashful, and that temperance is the same as modesty.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Well now, I asked, did you not admit a moment ago that temperance is honorable?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Certainly I did, he said.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And temperate men are also good?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Yes.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Well, can that be good which does not produce good men?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>No, indeed.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And we conclude that it is not only honorable, but good also.
    <milestone unit="page" n="161"/><milestone unit="section" n="161a"/>I think so.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Well then, I said, are you not convinced that Homer is right in saying&mdash;<quote type="verse"><l met="dactylic">Modesty, no good mate for a needy man?</l></quote><bibl n="Hom. Od. 17.347">Hom. Od. 17.347</bibl><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>I am, he said.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Then it would seem that modesty is not good, and good.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Apparently.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>But temperance is good, if its presence makes men good, and not bad.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>It certainly seems to me to be as you say.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>So temperance cannot be modesty, if it
<milestone unit="section" n="161b"/>is in fact good, while modesty is no more good than evil.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Why, I think, he said, Socrates, that is correctly stated;  but there is another view of temperance on which I would like to have your opinion.  I remembered just now what I once heard someone say, that temperance might be doing one's own business.  I ask you, then, do you think he is right in saying this?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>You rascal, I said, you have heard it from Critias here,
<milestone unit="section" n="161c"/>or some other of our wise men!<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Seemingly, said Critias, from some other;  for indeed he did not from me.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>But what does it matter, Socrates, said Charmides, from whom I heard it?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Not at all, I replied;  for in any case we have not to consider who said it, but whether it is a true saying or no.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now you speak rightly, he said.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Yes, on my word, I said:  but I shall be surprised if we can find out how it stands;  for it looks like a kind of riddle.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Why so? he asked.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Because, I replied, presumably the speaker of the words
<milestone unit="section" n="161d"/>&ldquo;temperance is doing one's own business&rdquo; did not mean them quite as he spoke them.  Or do you consider that the scribe does nothing when he writes or reads?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>I rather consider that he does something, he replied.  And does the scribe, in your opinion, write and read his own name only, and teach you boys to do the same with yours? Or did you write your enemies' names just as much as your own and your friends'?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Just as much.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Well, were you meddlesome or intemperate
<milestone unit="section" n="161e"/>in doing this?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Not at all.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And you know you were not doing your own business, if writing and reading are doing something.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Why, so they are.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And indeed medical work, my good friend, and building and weaving and producing anything whatever that is the work of any art, I presume is doing something.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Certainly.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Well then, I went on, do you think a state would be well conducted under a law which enjoined that everyone should weave and scour his own coat, and make his own shoes, and his own flask and scraper,<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">The flask contained oil for anointing the body before exercise, and the scraper was for scraping it afterwards, or at the bath.</note>
<milestone unit="page" n="162"/><milestone unit="section" n="162a"/>and everything else on the same principle of not touching the affairs of others but performing and doing his own for himself?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>I think not, he replied.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>But still, I said, a state whose conduct is temperate will be well conducted.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Of course, he said.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Then doing one's own business in that sense and in that way will not be temperance.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Apparently not.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>So that person was riddling, it seems, just as I said a moment ago, when he said that doing one's own business is temperance.  For I take it he was not such a fool as all that:  or was it some idiot
<milestone unit="section" n="162b"/>that you heard saying this, Charmides?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Far from it, he replied, for indeed he seemed to be very wise.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Then it is perfectly certain, in my opinion, that he propounded it as a riddle, in view of the difficulty of understanding what &ldquo;doing one's own business&rdquo; can mean.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>I daresay, he said.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Well, what can it mean, this &ldquo;doing one's own business&rdquo;? Can you tell me?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>I do not know, upon my word, he replied:  but I daresay it may be that not even he who said it knew in the least what he meant.  And as he said this he gave a sly laugh and glanced at Critias.
<milestone unit="section" n="162c"/>Now Critias for some time had been plainly burning with anxiety to distinguish himself in the eyes of Charmides and the company, and having with difficulty restrained himself heretofore, he now could do so no longer;  for I believe that what I had supposed was perfectly true&mdash;that Charmides had heard this answer about temperance from Critias.  And so Charmides, wishing him to make answer
<milestone unit="section" n="162d"/>instead of himself, sought to stir him up in particular, and pointed out that he himself had been refuted;  but Critias rebelled against it, and seemed to me to have got angry with him, as a poet does with an actor who mishandles his verses on the stage:  so he looked hard at him and said:  Do you really suppose, Charmides, that if you do not know what can have been the meaning of the man who said that temperance was doing one's own business, he did not know either?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Why, my excellent Critias, I said, no wonder if our friend, at his age, cannot understand;  but you,
<milestone unit="section" n="162e"/>I should think, may be expected to know, in view of your years and your studies.  So if you concede that temperance is what he says, and you accept the statement, for my part I would greatly prefer to have you as partner in the inquiry as to whether this saying is true or not.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Well, I quite concede it, he said, and accept it.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>That is good, then, I said.  Now tell me, do you also concede what I was asking just now&mdash;that all craftsmen make something?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>I do.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And do you consider that they make their own things only, or those of others also?
<milestone unit="page" n="163"/><milestone unit="section" n="163a"/>Those of others also.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And are they temperate in not making their own things only?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Yes:  what reason is there against it? he said.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>None for me, I replied;  but there may be for him who, after assuming that temperance is doing one's own business, proceeds to say there is no reason against those also who do others' business being temperate.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And have I, pray, he said, admitted that those who do others' business are temperate? Or was my admission of those who make<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">The Greek word <foreign lang="greek">poiei=n</foreign> (&ldquo;make&rdquo;) can also mean the same as <foreign lang="greek">pra/ttein</foreign> (&ldquo;do&rdquo;).</note> things?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Tell me, I said, do you not call making and doing the same?
<milestone unit="section" n="163b"/>No indeed, he replied, nor working and making the same either:  this I learnt from Hesiod, who said, <cit><quote type="verse"><l met="P">Work is no reproach.</l></quote><bibl>Hes. WD 309</bibl></cit>  Now, do you suppose that if he had given the names of working and doing to such works as you were mentioning just now, he would have said there was no reproach in shoe-making or pickle-selling or serving the stews?  It is not to be thought, Socrates;  he rather held,
<milestone unit="section" n="163c"/>I conceive, that making was different from doing and working, and that while a thing made might be a reproach if it had no connection with the honorable, work could never be a reproach.  For things honorably and usefully made he called works, and such makings he called workings and doings;  and we must suppose that it was only such things as these that he called our proper concerns, but all that was harmful, the concerns of others.  So that we must conclude that Hesiod, and anyone else of good sense, calls him temperate who does his own business.
<milestone unit="section" n="163d"/>Ah, Critias, I said, you had hardly begun, when I grasped the purport of your speech&mdash;that you called one's proper and one's own things good, and that the makings of the good you called doings;  for in fact I have heard Prodicus drawing innumerable distinctions between names.<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">&ldquo;Names&rdquo; here includes any substantive words such as <foreign lang="greek">pra/ceis</foreign>.</note> Well, I will allow you any application of a name that you please;  only make clear to what thing it is that you attach such-and-such a name.  So begin now over again, and define more plainly.
<milestone unit="section" n="163e"/>Do you say that this doing or making, or whatever is the term you prefer, of good things, is temperance?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>I do, he replied.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Then not he who does evil, but he who does good, is temperate?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And do not you, my excellent friend, he said, think so?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Leave that aside, I said;  for we have not to consider yet what I think, but what you say now.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Well, all the same, I say, he replied, that he who does evil instead of good is not temperate, whereas he who does good instead of evil is temperate :  for I give you &ldquo;the doing of good things is temperance&rdquo; as my plain definition.
<milestone unit="page" n="164"/><milestone unit="section" n="164a"/>And there is no reason, I daresay, why your statement should not be right;  but still I wonder, I went on, whether you judge that temperate men are ignorant of their temperance.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>No, I do not, he said.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>A little while ago, I said, were you not saying that there was no reason why craftsmen should not be temperate in making others' things as well?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Yes, I was, he said, but what of it ?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Nothing;  only tell me whether you think that a doctor, in making someone healthy,
<milestone unit="section" n="164b"/>makes a helpful result both for himself and for the person whom he cures.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>I do.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And he who does this does his duty?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Yes.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Is not he who does his duty temperate?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Indeed he is.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Well, and must the doctor know when his medicine will be helpful, and when not? And must every craftsman know when he is likely to be benefited by the work he does, and when not?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Probably not.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Then sometimes, I went on, the doctor may have done what is helpful
<milestone unit="section" n="164c"/>or harmful without knowing the effect of his own action;  and yet, in doing what was helpful, by your statement, he has done temperately.  Or did you not state that?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>I did.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Then it would seem that in doing what is helpful he may sometimes do temperately and be temperate, but be ignorant of his own temperance?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>But that, he said, Socrates, could never be:  if you think this in any way a necessary inference from my previous admissions,
<milestone unit="section" n="164d"/>I would rather withdraw some of them, and not be ashamed to say my statements were wrong, than concede at any time that a man who is ignorant of himself is temperate.  For I would almost say that this very thing, self-knowledge, is temperance, and I am at one with him who put up the inscription of those words at <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName>.  For the purpose of that inscription on the temple, as it seems to me, is to serve as the god's salutation to those who enter it, instead of
<milestone unit="section" n="164e"/>&ldquo;Hail!&rdquo;&mdash;this is a wrong form of greeting, and they should rather exhort one another with the words, &ldquo;Be temperate!&rdquo; And thus the god addresses those who are entering his temple in a mode which differs from that of men;  such was the intention of the dedicator of the inscription in putting it up, I believe;  and that he says to each man who enters, in reality, <quote type="inscription">Be temperate !</quote>  But he says it in a rather riddling fashion, as a prophet would;  for &ldquo;Know thyself!&rdquo; and &ldquo;Be temperate!&rdquo; are the same, as
<milestone unit="page" n="165"/><milestone unit="section" n="165a"/>the inscription<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">Throughout this passage there is allusion to the thought or wisdom implied in <foreign lang="greek">swfronei=n</foreign>, and here Critias seeks to identify <foreign lang="greek">fro/nei</foreign> (&ldquo;think well,&rdquo; &ldquo;be wise&rdquo;) with <foreign lang="greek">gnw=qi</foreign> (&ldquo;know,&rdquo; &ldquo;understand&rdquo;) in the inscription <foreign lang="greek">gnw=qi sauto/n</foreign> at <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName>.</note> and I declare, though one is likely enough to think them different&mdash;an error into which I consider the dedicators of the later inscriptions fell when they put up <quote type="inscription">Nothing overmuch</quote><note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb"><foreign lang="greek">MHDE\N A)/GAN</foreign>appears first in Theognis, 335.</note> and <quote type="inscription">A pledge, and thereupon perdition.</quote><note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb"><foreign lang="greek">*)eggu/a pa/ra d' a)/th</foreign>, an old saying on the rashness of giving a pledge, is quoted in a fragment of Cratinus, the elder rival of Aristophanes.  Cf. Proverbs xi. 15&mdash;&rdquo;He that is surety for a stranger shall smart for it.&rdquo;</note> For they supposed that <quote type="inscription">Know thyself!</quote> was a piece of advice, and not the god's salutation of those who were entering;  and so, in order that their dedications too might equally give pieces of useful advice, they wrote these words and dedicated them.  Now my object in saying all this, Socrates, is to abandon to you all the previous argument&mdash;
<milestone unit="section" n="165b"/>for, though perhaps it was you who were more in the right, or perhaps it was I, yet nothing at all certain emerged from our statements&mdash;and to proceed instead to satisfy you of this truth, if you do not admit it, that temperance is knowing oneself.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Why, Critias, I said, you treat me as though I professed to know the things on which I ask questions, and needed only the will to agree with you.  But the fact of the matter is rather that I join you in the inquiry, each time that a proposition is made, because I myself do not know;  I wish therefore to consider first,
<milestone unit="section" n="165c"/>before I tell you whether I agree or not.  Now, give me a moment to consider.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Consider then, he said.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Yes, and I am considering, I said.  For if temperance is knowing anything, obviously it must be a kind of science, and a science of something, must it not?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>It is, he replied, and of itself.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And medicine, I said, is a science of health?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Certainly.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Then if you should ask me, I said, wherein medicine, as a science of health, is useful to us, and what it produces,
<milestone unit="section" n="165d"/>I should say it is of very great benefit, since it produces health;  an excellent result, if you allow so much.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>I allow it.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And so, if you should ask me what result I take to be produced by building, as the builder's science, I should say houses;  and it would be the same with the other arts.  Now it is for you, in your turn, to find an answer to a question regarding temperance&mdash;since you say it is a science of self, Critias&mdash;and to tell me what excellent result it produces for us,
<milestone unit="section" n="165e"/>as science of self, and what it does that is worthy of its name.  Come now, tell me.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>But, Socrates, he said, you are not inquiring rightly.  For in its nature it is not like the other sciences, any more than any of them is like any other;  whereas you are making your inquiry as though they were alike.  For tell me, he said, what result is there of the arts of reckoning and geometry, in the way that a house is of building, or a coat of weaving, or other products of the sort that one might point to
<milestone unit="page" n="166"/><milestone unit="section" n="166a"/>in various arts? Well, can you, for your part, point to any such product in those two cases? You cannot.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>To this I replied:  What you say is true;  but I can point out to you what is the peculiar subject of each of these sciences, distinct in each case from the science itself.  Thus reckoning, I suppose, is concerned with the even and the odd in their numerical relations to themselves and to one another, is it not?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Certainly, he said.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And you grant that the odd and the even are different from the actual art of reckoning?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Of course.
<milestone unit="section" n="166b"/>And once more, weighing is concerned with the heavier and the lighter weight;  but the heavy and the light are different from the actual art of weighing:  you agree?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>I do.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Then tell me, what is that of which temperance is the science, differing from temperance itself?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>There you are, Socrates, he said:  you push your investigation up to the real question at issue&mdash;in what temperance differs from all the other sciences&mdash;but you then proceed to seek some resemblance between it
<milestone unit="section" n="166c"/>and them;  whereas there is no such thing, for while all the rest of the sciences have something other than themselves as their subject, this one alone is a science of the other sciences and of its own self.  And of this you are far from being unconscious, since in fact, as I believe, you are doing the very thing you denied you were doing just now:  for you are attempting to refute me, without troubling to follow the subject of our discussion.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>How can you think, I said, if my main effort is to refute you, that I do it with any other motive than that which
<milestone unit="section" n="166d"/>would impel me to investigate the meaning of my own words&mdash;from a fear of carelessly supposing, at any moment, that I knew something while I knew it not?  And so it is now:  that is what I am doing, I tell you.  I am examining the argument mainly for my own sake, but also, perhaps, for that of my other intimates.  Or do you not think it is for the common good, almost, of all men, that the truth about everything there is should be discovered?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Yes indeed, he replied, I do, Socrates.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Then take heart, I said, my admirable friend, and answer the question put to you as you deem the case to be, without caring a jot
<milestone unit="section" n="166e"/>whether it is Critias or Socrates who is being refuted:  give the argument itself your attention, and observe what will become of it under the test of refutation.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Well, he said, I will do so;  for I think there is a good deal in what you say.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Then tell me, I said, what you mean in regard to temperance.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Why, I mean, he said, that it alone of all the sciences is the science both of itself and of the other sciences.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>So then, I said, it will be the science of the lack of science also, besides being the science of science?<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">Science or exact knowledge must be able to measure not only the field of knowledge, but also that of its negation, ignorance.</note><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Certainly, he replied.
<milestone unit="page" n="167"/><milestone unit="section" n="167a"/>Then only the temperate person will know himself, and be able to discern what he really knows and does not know, and have the power of judging what other people likewise know and think they know, in cases where they do know, and again, what they think they know, without knowing it;  everyone else will be unable.  And so this is being temperate, or temperance, and knowing oneself&mdash;that one should know what one knows and what one does not know.  Is that what you mean?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>It is, he replied.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Once more then, I said, as our third offering to the Saviour,<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">It was the custom at banquets to dedicate a third and final wine-offering or toast to Zeus the Saviour.  Cf. <bibl n="Pind. I. 5">Pind. I. 5</bibl> init.</note>
<milestone unit="section" n="167b"/>let us consider afresh, in the first place, whether such a thing as this is possible or not&mdash;to know that one knows, and does not know, what one knows and what one does not know;  and secondly, if this is perfectly possible, what benefit we get by knowing it.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>We must indeed consider, he said.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Come then, I said, Critias, consider if you can show yourself any more resourceful than I am;  for I am at a loss.  Shall I explain to you in what way?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>By all means, he replied.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Well, I said, what all this comes to, if your last statement was correct, is merely that there is one science which
<milestone unit="section" n="167c"/>is precisely a science of itself and of the other sciences, and moreover is a science of the lack of science at the same time.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Certainly.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Then mark what a strange statement it is that we are attempting to make, my friend:  for if you will consider it as applied to other cases, you will surely see&mdash;so I believe&mdash;its impossibility.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>How so? In what cases?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>In the following:  ask yourself if you think there is a sort of vision which is not the vision of things that we see in the ordinary way, but a vision of itself and of the other sorts of vision,
<milestone unit="section" n="167d"/>and of the lack of vision likewise;  which, while being vision, sees no color, but only itself and the other sorts of vision.  Do you think there is any such?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Upon my word, I do not.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And what do you say to a sort of hearing which hears not a single sound, but hears itself and the other sorts of hearing and lack of hearing?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>I reject that also.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Then take all the senses together as a whole, and consider if you think there is any sense of the senses and of itself, but insensible of any of the things of which the other senses are sensible.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>I do not.
<milestone unit="section" n="167e"/>Now, do you think there is any desire which is the desire, not of any pleasure, but of itself and of the other desires ?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>No, indeed.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Nor, again, is there a wish, I imagine, that wishes no good, but wishes itself and the other wishes.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Quite so;  there is not.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And would you say there is any love of such a sort that it is actually a love of no beauty, but of itself and of the other loves?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Not I, he replied.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And have you ever observed any fear which fears itself
<milestone unit="page" n="168"/><milestone unit="section" n="168a"/>and the other fears, but has no fear of a single dreadful thing?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>No, I have not, he replied.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Or an opinion which is an opinion of opinions and of itself, but without any opinion such as the other opinions have?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>By no means.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>But it is apparently a science of this kind that we are assuming&mdash;one that is a science of no branch of study, but a science of itself and of the other sciences.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>So we are.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And it is a strange thing, if it really exists?  For we should not affirm as yet that it does not exist, but should still consider whether it does exist.
<milestone unit="section" n="168b"/>You are right.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Well now, this science is a science of something, that is, it has a certain faculty whereby it can be a science of something, has it not?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Certainly.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>For, you know, we say the greater has a certain faculty whereby it can be greater than something?<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">At this point Socrates adduces the relation of greater to smaller (<foreign lang="greek">tino\s ei)=nai mei=zon</foreign>) to suggest a difficulty in conceiving a science to be a science of itself:  in so doing he draws a false analogy between two quite different uses of the genitive in Greek, represented in English by the comparative &ldquo;than&rdquo; and the objective &ldquo;of.&rdquo;</note><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Quite so.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>That is, than something smaller, if it is to be greater.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Necessarily.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>So if we could find a greater which is greater than other greater things, and than itself, but not greater than the things
<milestone unit="section" n="168c"/>beside which the others are greater, I take it there can be no doubt that it would be in the situation of being, if greater than itself, at the same time smaller than itself, would it not?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Most inevitably, Socrates, he said.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Or again, if there is a double of other doubles and of itself, both it and the others must of course be halves, if it is to be their double;  for, you know, a double cannot be &ldquo;of&rdquo; anything else than its half.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>True.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And what is more than itself will also be less, and the heavier will be lighter, and the older
<milestone unit="section" n="168d"/>younger, and so on with everything else:  whatever has its own faculty applied to itself will have also the natural quality to which its faculty was applicable, will it not? For instance, hearing is, as we say, just a hearing of sound, is it not?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Yes.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>So if it is to hear itself, it will hear a sound of its own;  for it would not hear otherwise.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Most inevitably.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And sight, I suppose, my excellent friend, if it is to see itself, must needs have a color;  for sight
<milestone unit="section" n="168e"/>can never see what is colorless.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>No more it can.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Then do you perceive, Critias, in the various cases we have propounded, how some of them strike us as absolutely impossible, while others raise serious doubts as to the faculty of the thing being ever applicable to itself?  For with magnitudes, numbers, and the like it is absolutely impossible, is it not?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Certainly.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>But again, with hearing and sight, or in the further bases of motion moving itself and heat burning itself, and all other
<milestone unit="page" n="169"/><milestone unit="section" n="169a"/>actions of the sort, the fact must appear incredible to some, but perhaps not to others.  So what we want, my friend, is some great man who will determine to our satisfaction in every respect whether there is nothing in nature so constituted as to have its own faculty applicable to itself, and not only some other object, or whether there are some such, and others not such;  and whether, again, if there are things that have such relation to themselves, they include a science which we assert to be temperance.  For my part, I distrust my own competence to determine these questions, and hence I am neither able to affirm whether it is possible
<milestone unit="section" n="169b"/>that there should be a science of science, nor willing, let it be ever so true, to acknowledge this to be temperance until I have made out whether such a thing as this would benefit us or not.  For, you see, I have a presentiment that temperance is something beneficial and good;  and you, therefore, son of Callaeschrus&mdash;since you lay it down that temperance is this very science of science, and moreover of the lack of science&mdash;shall first indicate the possibility, as I put it just now, and then the benefit added to the possibility, of such a thing;
<milestone unit="section" n="169c"/>and perhaps you will then satisfy me that your definition of temperance is correct.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now when Critias heard this and saw me in a difficulty, he seemed to me&mdash;just as the sight of someone yawning opposite causes people to be affected in the same way&mdash;to be compelled by the sense of my difficulty to be caught in a difficulty himself.  And so, since he usually contrived to distinguish himself, he was too ashamed to bring himself to admit to me before the company that he was unable to determine the questions
<milestone unit="section" n="169d"/>with which I challenged him, and he made a very indistinct reply in order to conceal his difficulty.  Then I, to forward the discussion, remarked:  Well, if you prefer, Critias, let us concede for the moment that there may possibly be a science of science :  some other time we shall consider whether such is the fact or not.  Come then;  suppose it is perfectly possible:  how is one helped thereby to know what one knows and does not know?  For this, you are aware, we said<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb"><bibl n="Plat. Charm. 167a">Plat. Charm. 167a</bibl>.</note> was the meaning of self-knowledge and temperance, did we not?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Certainly, he said;  and it must surely follow, Socrates;
<milestone unit="section" n="169e"/>for if a man has a science which knows itself, he will be similar himself to that which he has.  For instance, he who has swiftness will be swift, he who has beauty will be beautiful, and he who has knowledge will know;  and when he has knowledge that is of itself, he will then, surely, be in the position of knowing himself.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>I do not dispute, I said, that when a man has that which knows itself he will know himself;  but having that, how is he bound to know what he knows and what he does not know?
<milestone unit="page" n="170"/><milestone unit="section" n="170a"/>Because, Socrates, the two things are the same.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>I daresay, I said;  but I am afraid I am still my old self:  I still do not see how knowing what one knows and does not know is the same as the other.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>How do you mean? he asked.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>In this way, I replied: will a science of science, if such exists, be able to do more than determine that one of two things is science, and the other is not science?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>No, only that.
<milestone unit="section" n="170b"/>Now, is science or lack of science of health the same as science or lack of science of justice?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>By no means.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>For the one, I suppose, is medicine, and the other politics, while the thing in question is merely science.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Yes, to be sure.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And if a man has no added knowledge of health and justice, but knows only science, as having science of that alone, he will probably know that he has a certain piece of scientific knowledge about himself and about other people, will he not?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Yes.
<milestone unit="section" n="170c"/>But how will this science help him to know what he knows?  For of course he knows health by means of medicine, not temperance, and harmony by means of music, not temperance, and building by means of the builder's art, not temperance;  and so it will be in every case, will it not?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Apparently.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And how will temperance, supposing it is only a science of sciences, help him to know that he knows health, or that he knows building?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>By no means.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Then he who is ignorant of all this will not know what he knows, but only that he knows.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>So it seems.
<milestone unit="section" n="170d"/>Then being temperate, or temperance, will not be this knowledge of what one knows or does not know, but, it would seem, merely knowing that one knows or does not know.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>It looks like it.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Then such a person will also be unable to examine another man's claim to some knowledge, and make out whether he knows or does not know what he says he knows:  he will merely know, it would seem, that he has a certain knowledge;  but of what it is, temperance will not cause him to know.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Apparently not.
<milestone unit="section" n="170e"/>So he will be able to distinguish neither the man who pretends to be a doctor, but is none, from the man who really is one, nor any other man who has knowledge from him who has none.  But let us consider it another way:  if the temperate man or anybody else would discriminate between the true doctor and the false, he will go to work thus, will he not?  He will surely not talk to him about medicine;  for, as we were saying, the doctor understands nothing else but health and disease.  Is not that so?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Yes, it is.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>But about science he knows nothing, for that, you know, we assigned to temperance alone.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Yes.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>So the medical man knows nothing about medicine either, since
<milestone unit="page" n="171"/><milestone unit="section" n="171a"/>medicine is, of course, a science.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>True.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Then the temperate man will know, indeed, that the doctor has a certain science;  but when he has to put its nature to the proof, must he not consider what its subjects are?  Is not each science marked out, not merely as a science, but as a particular one, by the particular subjects it has?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>It is, to be sure.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And medicine is marked out as different from the other sciences by being a science of health and disease.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Yes.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And so anyone who wishes to inquire into medicine
<milestone unit="section" n="171b"/>must make those things, whatever they may be, with which it is concerned, the matter of his inquiry;  not those foreign things, I presume, with which it is not?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>No, indeed.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Then he who conducts his inquiry aright will consider the doctor, as a medical man, in connection with cases of health and disease.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>So it seems.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And will inquire whether, in what is said or done in such cases, his words are truly spoken, and his acts rightly done?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>He must.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Well now, could anyone follow up either of these points without the medical art?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>No, indeed.
<milestone unit="section" n="171c"/>Nobody at all, it would seem, but a doctor;  and so not the temperate man either:  for he would have to be a doctor, in addition to his temperance.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>That is so.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Then inevitably, if temperance is only a science of science and of lack of science, it will be equally unable to distinguish a doctor who knows the business of his art from one who does not know but pretends or thinks he does, and any other person who has knowledge of anything at all:  one will only distinguish one's fellow-artist, as craftsmen usually can.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Apparently, he said.
<milestone unit="section" n="171d"/>Then what benefit, I asked, Critias, can we still look for from temperance, if it is like that?  For if, as we began by assuming, the temperate man knew what he knew and what he did not know, and that he knows the one and does not know the other, and if he were able to observe this same condition in bother man, it would be vastly to our benefit, we agree, to be temperate;  since we should pass all our lives, both we who had temperance and all the rest who were governed by us,
<milestone unit="section" n="171e"/>without error.  For neither should we ourselves attempt to do what we did not know, instead of finding out those who knew and placing the matter in their hands, nor should we permit others under our governance to do anything but what they were likely to do aright;  and they would do that when they had knowledge of it;  and so it would be that a house which was ordered, or a state which was administered, as temperance bade, and everything else
<milestone unit="page" n="172"/><milestone unit="section" n="172a"/>that was ruled by temperance, could not but be well ordered;  for with error abolished, and rightness leading, in their every action men would be bound to do honorably and well under such conditions, and those who did well would be happy.  Did we not so speak of temperance, I said, Critias, when we remarked how great a boon it was to know what one knows and what one does not know?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>To be sure we did, he replied.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Whereas now, I went on, you see that nowhere can any such science be found.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>I see, he said.
<milestone unit="section" n="172b"/>Then may we say, I asked, that there is this good point in the knowledge of knowledge and of lack of knowledge, which we now find to be what temperance is, that he who has it will not only learn more easily whatever he learns, but will perceive everything more plainly, since besides the particular things that he learns he will behold the science;  and hence he will probe more surely the state of other men respecting the things which he has learnt himself, while those who probe without such knowledge will do it more feebly and poorly?  Are these, my friend, the kind of advantages that we shall gain
<milestone unit="section" n="172c"/>from temperance?  But are we really looking at something greater, and requiring it to be something greater than it really is?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Probably, he replied, that is so.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>I daresay, I said;  and I daresay also our inquiry has been worthless.  And this I conclude, because I observe certain strange facts about temperance, if it is anything like that.  For suppose, if you please, we concede that there may possibly be a science of science, and let us grant, and not withdraw, our original proposition that temperance is the knowledge of what one knows and does not know;
<milestone unit="section" n="172d"/>granting all this, let us still more thoroughly inquire whether on these terms it will be of any profit to us.  For our suggestion just now, that temperance of that sort, as our guide in ordering house or state, must be a great boon, was not, to my thinking, Critias, a proper admission.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>How so? he asked.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Because, I replied, we too tightly admitted that it would be a great boon to mankind if each of us should do what he knows, but should place what he did not know in the hands of others who had the knowledge.
<milestone unit="section" n="172e"/>Well, was that, he asked, not a proper admission?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Not to my mind, I answered.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>In very truth, your words are strange!  he said, Socrates.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Yes, by the Dog, I said, and they strike me too in the same way;  and it was in view of this, just now, that I spoke of strange results that I noticed, and said I feared we were not inquiring rightly.  For in truth, let temperance be ever so much what we say it is, I see nothing
<milestone unit="page" n="173"/><milestone unit="section" n="173a"/>to show what good effect it has on us.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>How so? he asked:  tell us, in order that we on our side may know what you mean.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>I expect, I said, I am talking nonsense:  but still one is bound to consider what occurs to one, and not idly ignore it, if one has even a little concern for oneself.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And you are quite right, he said.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Hear then, I said, my dream, whether it has come through horn or through ivory.<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">Cf. <bibl n="Hom. Od. 19.562">Hom. Od. 19.562</bibl>ff.  Dreams are there described as issuing:  dreams that come true are from the gate of horn;  deceitful dreams are from the gate of ivory.</note> Suppose that temperance were such as we now define her,
<milestone unit="section" n="173b"/>and that she had entire control of us:  must it not be that every act would be done according to the sciences, and no one professing to be a pilot when he was not would deceive us, nor would a doctor, nor a general, nor anyone else pretending to know something he did not know, go undetected;  and would not these conditions result in our having greater bodily health than we have now, safety in perils of the sea and war, and skilful workmanship in all our utensils, our clothes,
<milestone unit="section" n="173c"/>our shoes, nay, everything about us, and various things besides, because we should be employing genuine craftsmen?  And if you liked, we might concede that prophecy, as the knowledge of what is to be, and temperance directing her, will deter the charlatans, and establish the true prophets as our prognosticators.  Thus equipped, the human race would indeed act and live
<milestone unit="section" n="173d"/>according to knowledge, I grant you (for temperance, on the watch, would not suffer ignorance to foist herself in and take a hand in our labors), but that by acting according to knowledge we should do well and be happy&mdash;this is a point which as yet we are unable to make out, my dear Critias.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>But still, he replied, you will have some difficulty in finding any other fulfillment of welfare if you reject the rule of knowledge.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Then inform me further, I said, on one more little matter.  Of what is this knowledge? Do you mean of shoe-making?
<milestone unit="section" n="173e"/>Good heavens, not I!<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Well, of working in brass?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>By no means.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Well, in wool, or in wood, or in something else of that sort?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>No, indeed.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Then we no longer hold, I said, to the statement that he who lives according to knowledge is happy;  for these workers, though they live according to knowledge, are not acknowledged by you to be happy:  you rather delimit the happy man, it seems to me, as one who lives according to knowledge about certain things.  And I daresay you are referring to my instance of a moment ago, the man who knows
<milestone unit="page" n="174"/><milestone unit="section" n="174a"/>all that is to come, the prophet.  Do you refer to him or to someone else?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Yes, I refer to him, he said, and someone else too.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Whom? I asked.  Is it the sort of person who might know, besides what is to be, both everything that has been and now is, and might be ignorant of nothing? Let us suppose such a man exists:  you are not going to tell me, I am sure, of anyone alive who is yet more knowing than he.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>No, indeed.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Then there is still one more thing I would fain know:  which of the sciences is it that makes him happy? Or does he owe it to all of them alike?
<milestone unit="section" n="174b"/>By no means to all alike, he replied.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>But to which sort most?  One that gives him knowledge of what thing, present, past or future?  Is it that by which he knows draught-playing?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Draught-playing indeed! he replied.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Well, reckoning?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>By no means.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Well, health?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>More likely, he said.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And that science to which I refer as the most likely, I went on, gives him knowledge of what?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Of good, he replied, and of evil.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Vile creature!  I said, you have all this time been dragging me round and round, while concealing the fact that the life according to knowledge does not make us do well and be happy, not even
<milestone unit="section" n="174c"/>if it be knowledge of all the other knowledges together, but only if it is of this single one concerning good and evil.  For, Critias, if you choose to take away this science from the whole number of them, will medicine any the less give us health, or shoemaking give us shoes, or weaving provide clothes, or will the pilot's art any the less prevent the loss of life at sea, or the general's in war?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>None the less, he replied.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>But, my dear Critias, to have any of these things well
<milestone unit="section" n="174d"/>and beneficially done will be out of our reach if that science is lacking.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>That is true.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And that science, it seems, is not temperance, but one whose business is to benefit us;  for it is not a science of sciences and lack of sciences, but of good and evil:  so that if this is beneficial, temperance must be something else to us.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>But why, he asked, should not it be beneficial?  For if temperance is above all a science of the sciences,
<milestone unit="section" n="174e"/>and presides too over the other sciences, surely she will govern this science of the good, and so benefit us.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And give us health also?  I asked:  will she, and not medicine, do this? And will the several works of the other arts be hers, and not the particular works of each art?  Have we not constantly protested that she is only knowledge of knowledge and of lack of knowledge, and of nothing else?  Is not that so?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Apparently it is.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Then she will not be a producer of health?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>No, indeed.
<milestone unit="page" n="175"/><milestone unit="section" n="175a"/>For health, we said, belongs to another art, did we not?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>We did.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Nor of benefit, my good friend;  for this work, again, we assigned to another art just now, did we not?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Certainly.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Then how will temperance be beneficial, if it produces no benefit?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>By no means, Socrates, as it seems.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>So do you see, Critias, how all the time I had good reason for my fear, and fair ground for the reproach I made against myself, that my inquiry regarding temperance was worthless?<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">Cf. <bibl n="Plat. Charm. 172c">Plat. Charm. 172c</bibl>.</note> For I cannot think that what is admitted to be the noblest thing in the world
<milestone unit="section" n="175b"/>would have appeared to us useless if I had been of any use for making a good search.  But now, you see, we are worsted every way, and cannot discover what thing it can possibly be to which the lawgiver gave this name, temperance.  And yet we have conceded many points which were not deducible from our argument.  For you know we conceded that there was a science of science, when the argument was against it and would not agree;  and we further conceded that
<milestone unit="section" n="175c"/>this science could know the works also of the other sciences, when the argument was against this too, in order to make out that the temperate man had a knowledge of what he knew and did not know, so as to know that he knew the one and did not know the other.  And we made this concession in a really magnificent manner, without considering the impossibility of a man knowing, in some sort of way, things that he does not know at all;  for our admission says that he knows that he does not know them;  and yet, in my opinion, there can be nothing more irrational than this.  Nevertheless, although it has found us so simple-minded
<milestone unit="section" n="175d"/>and tractable, the inquiry remains quite incapable of discovering the truth, but has utterly flouted it by most impudently showing us the inutility of that which we had been ever so long assuming, by our joint admissions and fictions, to be the meaning of temperance.  Now, so far as I am concerned, I am not particularly distressed:  but for your sake, I said, Charmides, I am seriously distressed to think that you, with your goodly form and
<milestone unit="section" n="175e"/>most temperate soul besides, are to have no profit or advantage from the presence of that temperance in all your life.  And I am still more distressed about the charm which I learnt from the Thracian,<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">Cf. <bibl n="Plat. Charm. 156d">Plat. Charm. 156d</bibl>.</note> that I should have spent so much pains on a lesson which has had such a worthless effect.  Now I really do not think that this can be the case, but rather that I am a poor hand at inquiring;  for temperance I hold to be a great good, and you to be highly blessed,
<milestone unit="page" n="176"/><milestone unit="section" n="176a"/>if you actually have it.  See now whether you have it, and are in no need of the charm;  for if it is yours, I should rather advise you to regard me as a babbler who is unable to argue out any subject of inquiry whatsoever, and yourself as advancing in happiness as you advance in temperance.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Then Charmides said:  Why, upon my word, Socrates, I do not know at all whether I have it or have it not.  For how can I know, when even you two are unable
<milestone unit="section" n="176b"/>to discover what this thing is?&mdash;so you say, but of this you do not at all convince me&mdash;and I quite believe, Socrates, that I do need the charm, and for my part I have no objection to being charmed by you every day of my life, until you say I have had enough of the treatment.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Very well, said Critias:  now, Charmides, if you do this, it will be a proof to me of your temperance&mdash;if you submit to be charmed by Socrates and do not forsake him through thick and thin.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Count on me to follow, he said, and not forsake him;
<milestone unit="section" n="176c"/>for it would ill become me to disobey you, my guardian, and refuse to do your bidding.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Well now, he said, I bid you.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Then I will do as you say, he replied, and will start this very day.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>There, there, I said, what are you two plotting to do?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Nothing, replied Charmides;  we have made our plot.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>So you will use force, I said, before even allowing me to make my affidavit?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>You must expect me to use force, he replied, since he gives me the command:  take counsel, therefore, on your side, as to what you will do
<milestone unit="section" n="176d"/>But that leaves no room, I said, for counsel;  for if once you set about doing anything and use force, no man alive will be able to withstand you.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Then do not you, he said, withstand me.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Then I will not withstand you, I replied.</p></body></text>

<milestone unit="page" n="178"/><milestone unit="section" n="178a"/><sp><speaker>Lysimachus</speaker><p>You have seen the performance of the man fighting in armour, Nicias and Laches;  but my friend Melesias and I did not tell you at the time our reason for requesting you to come and see it with us.  However, we will tell you now;  for we think we should speak our minds freely to friends like you.  Some people, of course, pour ridicule on such appeals, and when consulted for their advice will not say what they think,
<milestone unit="section" n="178b"/>but something different, making the inquirer's wishes their aim, and speaking against their own judgement.  But you, we consider, not merely have the necessary discernment but will give us the benefit of it in telling us just what is in your minds and hence we have enlisted your counsel on the question which we are about to lay before you.  Now the matter about which I have made all this long preamble is this: 
<milestone unit="page" n="179"/><milestone unit="section" n="179a"/>we have two sons here, my friend that one, called Thucydides after his grandfather, and I this one;  he also is named in the same way, after my father;  we call him Aristeides.  Well, we have resolved to give them our most constant care, and not&mdash;as most fathers do when their boys begin to be young men<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb"><foreign lang="greek">MEIRA/KION</foreign>applied to youths from 15 to 21.</note>&mdash;let them run loose as their fancy leads them, but begin forthwith taking
<milestone unit="section" n="179b"/>every possible care of them.  Now, knowing that you too have sons, we thought that you above all men must have concerned yourselves with the question of the kind of upbringing that would make the best of them;  and if by any chance you have not given your attention to the subject, we would remind you that it ought not to be neglected, and we invite you to join us in arranging some way of taking care of our sons. How we formed this resolve, Nicias and Laches, is worth hearing, even though the story be somewhat long.  My friend Melesias and I take our meals together,
<milestone unit="section" n="179c"/>and our boys share our table.  Now, as I said at the beginning of my remarks, we are going to speak quite freely to you.  Each of us has many noble deeds of his own father to relate to these young fellows&mdash;their numerous achievements both in war and in peace, when they were managing the affairs either of the allies or of this city;  but neither of us has any deeds of his own to tell.  We cannot help feeling ashamed that our boys should observe this, and we blame our fathers
<milestone unit="section" n="179d"/>for leaving us to indulge ourselves when we began to be young men, while they looked after other folks' affairs;  and we point the moral of it all to these young people, telling them that if they are careless of themselves and will not take our advice they will win no reputation, but if they take due pains they may very likely come to be worthy of the names they bear.  Now they, for their part, say they will do as we bid;  so we are now considering what lessons or pursuits will lead them to the highest attainable excellence. Someone directed us to this particular accomplishment
<milestone unit="section" n="179e"/>of fighting in armor, as being an admirable one for a young man to learn;  and he praised that man whose performance you were just watching, and then urged us to go and see him.  So we decided that it would be well to go and see the man ourselves, and to take you along with us not merely as companions at the show, but also as counsellors and copartners, if you will be so good, in the matter of looking after our sons. 
<milestone unit="page" n="180"/><milestone unit="section" n="180a"/>That is the question which we wanted to discuss with you.  And we look to you now, on your part, to give us your advice, first as to whether you think this accomplishment should be learnt or not, and then as to any other such art or pursuit that you can recommend for a young man;  and also, how you feel inclined as regards our partnership.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Nicias</speaker><p>For myself, Lysimachus and Melesias, I highly approve of your purpose, and am ready to lend a hand and I may say the same, I think, for Laches here.
<milestone unit="section" n="180b"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Laches</speaker><p>Yes, you think truly, Nicias.  For that remark which Lysimachus made just now about his father and the father of Melesias was very apposite, in my opinion, not only to them but to us and to all who deal with public affairs:  it is practically the rule with them, as he says, to treat their private concerns, whether connected with children or any thing else, in a slighting, careless spirit.  You are quite right in saying that, Lysimachus; 
<milestone unit="section" n="180c"/>but to invite us to be your advisers for the education of your boys, and not to invite Socrates here, is to me very strange, when, to begin with, he is of your district, and then he is always spending his time wherever there is any such excellent study or pursuit for young men as you are seeking.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Lysimachus</speaker><p>How do you mean, Laches?  Has Socrates here given his attention to anything of this sort?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Laches</speaker><p>To be sure he has, Lysimachus.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Nicias</speaker><p>I too might perhaps be in as good a position as Laches to inform you about that;  for quite recently he introduced to myself
<milestone unit="section" n="180d"/>a music-teacher for my son&mdash;<placeName key="tgn,2274807">Damon</placeName>, pupil of Agathocles, who is not only the most exquisitely skilled of musicians, but in every other way as profitable a companion as you could wish for young men of that age.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Lysimachus</speaker><p>It is not possible, Socrates, Nicias, and Laches, for men of my years to continue to know our juniors, because old age makes us spend most of our time at home;  but if you, son of Sophroniscus, have any good advice for our friend, who belongs to your own district,
<milestone unit="section" n="180e"/>you ought to let him have it.  And it is only right that you should:  for you happen to be our friend through your father he and I were constant companions and friends, and he died without ever having a single difference with me.  And a certain recollection comes back to me on hearing what has just been said:  for these boys, in talking with each other at home, frequently mention Socrates in terms of high praise;  but I have never asked them whether they meant the son of Sophroniscus. 
<milestone unit="page" n="181"/><milestone unit="section" n="181a"/>Now tell me, my boys, is this the Socrates whose name you have mentioned so often?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Son</speaker><p>To be sure, father, it is he.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Lysimachus</speaker><p>On my soul, Socrates, it is good to know that you keep up your father's name, which was a most honorable one, both on general grounds and particularly because of the intimate relation in which you and we shall equally feel ourselves to be.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Laches</speaker><p>Indeed, Lysimachus, he is a person you must not lose hold of;  for I have observed him elsewhere too keeping up not merely his father's
<milestone unit="section" n="181b"/>but his country's name.  He accompanied me in the retreat from <placeName key="tgn,6001700">Delium</placeName>,<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">On the coast just north of <placeName key="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName>, where the Athenians were severely defeated by the Boeotians in <date value="-424">424</date> B.C.</note> and I assure you that if the rest had chosen to be like him, our city would be holding up her head and would not then have had such a terrible fall.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Lysimachus</speaker><p>Socrates, this is indeed splendid praise which you are now receiving from men whose word is of great weight, and for such conduct as wins their praise.  So let me tell you that I rejoice to hear this and to know you have such a good reputation;  and you in return must count me as one of your warmest well-wishers.
<milestone unit="section" n="181c"/>You ought indeed, on your own part, to have visited us before, and treated us on intimate terms, as you have a right to do:  now, however, that we have discovered each other, from to-day onwards you must make a point of sharing our thoughts and getting to know us and our young people also, that you and they may in your turn preserve the friendship of our houses.  That, however, you will do yourself, and we will remind you of it another time:  but what do you say of the matter on which we began to speak?  What is your view?  Is the accomplishment of fighting in armor a suitable one for our boys to learn or not?
<milestone unit="section" n="181d"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>On that matter, Lysimachus, I will do my best to advise you, so far as I can, and also to do all the rest that you so kindly ask.  It seems to me, however, most proper that I, being so much younger and less experienced than you and your friends, should first hear what they have to say, and learn of them;  and then, if I have anything else to suggest as against their remarks, I might try to explain it and persuade you and them to take my view.  Come, Nicias, let one or other of you speak.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Nicias</speaker><p>There is no difficulty about that, Socrates.  For in my opinion
<milestone unit="section" n="181e"/>this accomplishment is in many ways a useful thing for young men to possess.  It is good for them, instead of spending their time on the ordinary things to which young men usually give their hours of leisure, to spend it on this, which not only has the necessary effect of improving their bodily health&mdash;
<milestone unit="page" n="182"/><milestone unit="section" n="182a"/>since it is as good and strenuous as any physical exercise&mdash;but is also a form of exercise which, with riding, is particularly fitting for a free citizen;  for only the men trained in the use of these warlike implements can claim to be trained in the contest whereof we are athletes and in the affairs wherein we are called upon to contend.<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">i.e., in regular warfare.</note> Further, this accomplishment will be of some benefit also in actual battle, when it comes to fighting in line with a number of other men;  but its greatest advantage will be felt when the ranks are broken, and you find you must fight man to man, either in pursuing someone who is trying to beat off your attack,
<milestone unit="section" n="182b"/>or in retreating yourself and beating off the attack of another.  Whoever possessed this accomplishment could come to no harm so long as he had but one to deal with, nor yet, perhaps, if he had several;  it would give him an advantage in any situation. Moreover, it is a thing which impels one to desire another noble accomplishment;  for everyone who has learnt how to fight in armor will desire to learn the accomplishment which comes next, the management of troops;  and when he has got that and once taken a pride in his work
<milestone unit="section" n="182c"/>he will push on to attain the whole art of generalship.  It is evident already that all accomplishments and pursuits in the military sphere are both honourable and valuable to a man, either in acquisition or in practice;  and this particular one may well be an introduction to them.  And we can make this addition&mdash;no slight one&mdash;to its claims, that this science will make any man individually a great deal bolder and braver in war.  Nor let us disdain to mention, even though some may think it a rather slight matter, that it will give him a smarter appearance in the place
<milestone unit="section" n="182d"/>where a man should look smartest, and where at the same time he will appear more terrible to the enemy because of his smartness.  So my opinion is, Lysimachus, as I say, that we ought to teach this skill to our young men, and I have told you my reasons for so thinking. But if Laches has a different view to state, I shall be as glad as anyone to hear it.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Laches</speaker><p>Well, Nicias, I am loth to say of any sort of accomplishment that it ought not to be learnt;  for it seems good to know all things.  And besides,
<milestone unit="section" n="182e"/>if this skill in arms is an accomplishment, as they say who teach it, and as Nicias terms it, it ought to be learnt;  while if it is not an accomplishment, and those who promise to give it are deceiving us, or if it is an accomplishment, but not a very important one, what can be the good of learning it?  I speak of it in this way from the following point of view:  I conceive that if there were anything in it, it would not have been overlooked by the Lacedaemonians, whose only concern in life is to seek out and practise
<milestone unit="page" n="183"/><milestone unit="section" n="183a"/>whatever study or pursuit will give them an advantage over others in war.  And if they have overlooked it, at any rate these teachers of it cannot have overlooked the obvious fact that the Lacedaemonians are more intent on such matters than any of the Greeks, and that anybody who won honour among them for this art would amass great riches elsewhere, just as a tragic poet does who has won honor among us.  And for this reason he who thinks himself a good writer of tragedy
<milestone unit="section" n="183b"/>does not tour round with his show in a circuit of the outlying Attic towns, but makes a straight line for this place and exhibits to our people, as one might expect. But I notice that these fighters in armour regard <placeName key="tgn,7011065">Lacedaemon</placeName> as holy ground where none may tread, and do not step on it even with the tips of their toes, but circle round it and prefer to exhibit to any other people, especially to those who would themselves admit that they were inferior to many in the arts of war.  Furthermore, Lysimachus, I have come across more than a few of these persons
<milestone unit="section" n="183c"/>in actual operations, and I can see their quality.  Indeed, we can estimate it offhand:  for, as though it were of set purpose, not one of these experts in arms has ever yet distinguished himself in war.  And yet in all the other arts, the men who have made a name are to be found among those who have specially pursued one or other of them;  while these persons, apparently, stand out from the rest in this particularly hapless fate of their profession.  Why, this man Stesilaus, whom you watched with me in that great crowd as he gave his performance
<milestone unit="section" n="183d"/>and spoke in those high terms of himself before us, I have watched elsewhere giving a finer entertainment in the form of a very real display that he made against his will.  The ship on which he was serving struck a transport vessel, and he was using in the fight a combination of a scythe and a spear&mdash;a remarkable weapon that suited so remarkable a man.  Well, the story of this fellow's doings is hardly of enough interest in the main, but you must hear the upshot of his device of a scythe fixed to a spear. 
<milestone unit="section" n="183e"/>As he was fighting, it stuck somehow in the other ship's rigging, and held fast;  so Stesilaus pulled at it in the hope of getting it free, but he could not, and the ships were passing by each other.  For the first moments he ran along in his ship holding on to his spear;  but as the other ship sheered off from his and drew him after, still holding the spear, he let it slip through his hand
<milestone unit="page" n="184"/><milestone unit="section" n="184a"/>until he gripped the butt-end of the shaft.  From the crew of the transport there came laughter and clapping at his posture, and when someone aimed a stone at him which hit the deck near his feet, and he let go the spear, the troops on the warship in their turn could no longer restrain their laughter, as they saw the notable scythe-spear dangling from the transport.  Now, there may perhaps be something in this art of theirs, as Nicias argues, but at any rate that is my impression of it, in the cases I have met with.  Hence, as I said at the beginning,
<milestone unit="section" n="184b"/>whether it be an accomplishment, and one of but little use, or not an accomplishment, but only supposed and pretended to be such, it is not worth the trouble of learning it.  For indeed I hold that if a man who was a coward believed that he possessed it, his only gain would be in rashness, which would make his true nature the more conspicuous;  while if he were brave, people would be on the look-out for even the slightest mistake on his part, and he would incur much grievous slander;  for the pretension to such skill
<milestone unit="section" n="184c"/>arouses jealousy, so that unless a man be prodigiously superior to the rest in valor he cannot by any means escape being made a laughing-stock through professing to be so skilled.  Such is my opinion, Lysimachus, of the interest taken in this accomplishment;  but do as I told you at the beginning;  you are not to let our friend Socrates go, but must request him to advise us according to his judgement on the matter in hand.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Lysimachus</speaker><p>Well, I ask it of you, Socrates:  for indeed our members of council, as it were, seem to me to need
<milestone unit="section" n="184d"/>someone who will decide between them.  Had these two agreed, we should not have required this help so much;  but as it is&mdash;for Laches, you see, has voted on the opposite side to Nicias&mdash;it is as well that we should hear your view and see on which side you cast your vote.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>What, Lysimachus?  Are you going to join the side which gets the approval of the majority of us?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Lysimachus</speaker><p>Why, what can one do, Socrates?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And you too, Melesias, would do the same? 
<milestone unit="section" n="184e"/>Suppose you had a consultation as to what your son's exercise should be for a coming contest, would you be guided by the majority of us, or by the one who happened to have trained and exercised under a good master?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Melesias</speaker><p>By the latter, naturally, Socrates.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Would you be guided by him alone rather than the four of us?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Melesias</speaker><p>Very likely.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Yes, for a question must be decided by knowledge, and not by numbers, if it is to have a right decision.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Melesias</speaker><p>To be sure.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then in this case also we must first consider, in particular,
<milestone unit="page" n="185"/><milestone unit="section" n="185a"/>whether anyone among us has expert skill in the subject of our consultation, or not;  and if here is one who has, we must be guided by him, though he be but one, and pass over the rest;  while if there is not, we must look for somebody else.  Or do you think it a slight matter that you and Lysimachus have now at stake, and not that which is really your greatest possession?  For I take it that according as the sons turn out well or the opposite will the whole life of their father's house be affected, depending for better or worse on their character.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Melesias</speaker><p>Truly spoken.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>So it demands much forethought from us.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Melesias</speaker><p>Certainly.
<milestone unit="section" n="185b"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>How then&mdash;to take the case I suggested just now&mdash;should we set to work if we wanted to consider which of us was the most expert in regard to a contest?  Should we not pick him who had learnt and practised, and had also had good teachers of this particular skill?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Melesias</speaker><p>I think so.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And even before that, we should ask what was this skill of which we are looking for the teachers?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Melesias</speaker><p>How do you mean?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Perhaps it will be more easily grasped in this form.  I think we have not started with an agreement between us as to what the thing is about which we are consulting, in this question of who among us is an expert and to this end has resorted to teachers,
<milestone unit="section" n="185c"/>and who not.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Nicias</speaker><p>Why, Socrates, is it not fighting in armor that we are considering, and whether it is a thing to be learnt by young men or not?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Of course, Nicias;  but when someone considers whether a medicine is to be used as an eyesalve or not, do you think that this consultation is about the medicine or about the eyes?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Nicias</speaker><p>About the eyes.

<milestone unit="section" n="185e"/>for the sake of young men's souls?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Nicias</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>So what we have to consider is whether one of us is skilled in treatment of the soul, and is able to treat it rightly, and which of us has had good teachers.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Laches</speaker><p>But I say, Socrates, have you never noticed how some people have become more skilled in certain things without teachers than others with them?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Yes, I have, Laches;  people, that is, whom you would not care to trust on their mere statement that they were good practitioners, unless they could put forward some example of their personal skill&mdash;some work well carried out&mdash;
<milestone unit="page" n="186"/><milestone unit="section" n="186a"/>not in one only, but several cases.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Laches</speaker><p>That is truly spoken.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>We also, therefore, Laches and Nicias&mdash;since Lysimachus and Melesias have invited us to a consultation on their sons, whose souls they are anxious to have as good as possible&mdash;should bring to their notice what teachers we have had, if we say that we have any to mention, who being themselves good to begin with, and having treated the souls of many young people,
<milestone unit="section" n="186b"/>taught us also in due course and are known to have done so.  Or if any of ourselves says he has had no teacher, but has however some works of his own to speak of, and can point out to us what Athenians or strangers, either slaves or freemen, are acknowledged to owe their goodness to him, let him do so.  But if there is nothing of the sort to be found amongst us, let us bid them look elsewhere;  for we cannot run a risk with our good friends' children where we may ruin them, and so bring upon us the most grievous of accusations from our nearest and dearest.  Now I, Lysimachus and Melesias, am the first to avow
<milestone unit="section" n="186c"/>that I have had no teacher in this respect;  and yet I have longed for such lessons from my youth up.  But I have not the means to pay fees to the sophists, who were the only persons that professed to be able to make me a complete gentleman;  and to this moment I remain powerless to discover the art myself.  But I should not be surprised if Nicias or Laches has discovered or learnt it:  for they have more means at their command to enable them to learn from others, and they are also older, and have had time to discover it.  Indeed, I regard them as able to educate a man; 
<milestone unit="section" n="186d"/>for they would never declare their minds so freely on pursuits that are beneficial or harmful to a youth unless they felt confident that they had the requisite knowledge.  And I have entire confidence in them myself, except that I wondered at their differing from each other.  I therefore make this counter-request of you, Lysimachus:  just as Laches urged you a moment ago not to release me but to ask me questions, so I now call upon you not to release Laches or Nicias, but to question them in these terms:  &ldquo;Socrates says
<milestone unit="section" n="186e"/>that he has no understanding of the matter, and that he is not competent to decide which of your statements is true;  that he has never been either a discoverer or a learner of anything of the sort.  But you, Laches and Nicias, are each to tell us who is the cleverest person you have heard on the upbringing of youth;  whether you have knowledge of it by learning from someone or by discovering it yourselves;  and if you learnt it, who were your teachers respectively, and
<milestone unit="page" n="187"/><milestone unit="section" n="187a"/>what other colleagues they had:  in order that, if you are not at leisure through the demands of public business, we may go to them and induce them either with gifts or good turns or with both to undertake the care of our and your children together, and so prevent them from turning out knaves and disgracing their ancestors.  But if you have made the grand discovery yourselves, give us an instance to show what other persons you have succeeded in changing, by your care of them, from knaves to honest gentlemen.  For if you are now going to make your first attempt at educating,
<milestone unit="section" n="187b"/>you must beware lest you try your experiment, not on a &ldquo;corpus vile&rdquo;,<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">Lit. &ldquo;on the Carian slave.&rdquo;</note> but on your sons and the children of your friends, and you prove to be a mere case, as the proverbial saying has it, of starting pottery on a wine-jar.<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">i.e., on a large instead of small piece of work, in which a beginner's mistake would be less costly.  Cf. <title>Gorg.</title> 514 E.</note>  So tell us what you claim, or do not claim, as your resources and acquirements in this kind.&rdquo; There, Lysimachus, demand that from these good persons, and do not let them off.
<milestone unit="section" n="187c"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Lysimachus</speaker><p> To my mind, good sirs, these remarks of Socrates are excellent:  but it is for you, Nicias and Laches, to decide for yourselves whether it suits you to be questioned and offer some explanation on such points.  For I and Melesias here would certainly be delighted if you would consent to expound in detail all that Socrates puts to you in his questions:  as I began by saying at the outset, we invited you to consult with us just because we thought, very naturally, that you had given serious consideration to this kind of thing, especially as your boys,
<milestone unit="section" n="187d"/>like ours, are almost of an age to be educated.  Accordingly, if it is all the same to you, discuss it now by joint inquiry with Socrates, exchanging view's with him in turn:  for it is a particularly good remark of his that we are consulting now about the greatest of all our concerns.  Come, see if you consider that this is the proper course to take.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Nicias</speaker><p>Lysimachus, it looks to me, in very truth, as though you only knew Socrates at second hand&mdash;
<milestone unit="section" n="187e"/>through his father&mdash;and had not conversed with him personally except in his childhood, when you may have chanced to meet him among the people of his district, accompanying his father at the temple or at some local gathering.  But you have evidently not yet had to do with him since he has reached maturer years.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Lysimachus</speaker><p>How are you so sure of that, Nicias?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Nicias</speaker><p>You strike me as not being aware that, whoever comes into close contact with Socrates and has any talk with him face to face, is bound to be drawn round and round by him in the course of the argument&mdash;though it may have started at first on a quite different theme&mdash;and cannot stop until he is led into giving an account of himself, of the manner in which
<milestone unit="page" n="188"/><milestone unit="section" n="188a"/>he now spends his days, and of the kind of life he has lived hitherto;  and when once he has been led into that, Socrates will never let him go until he has thoroughly and properly put all his ways to the test.  Now I am accustomed to him, and so I know that one is bound to be thus treated by him, and further, that I myself shall certainly get the same treatment also.  For I delight, Lysimachus, in conversing with the man, and see no harm in our being reminded of
<milestone unit="section" n="188b"/>any past or present misdoing:  nay, one must needs take more careful thought for the rest of one's life, if one does not fly from his words but is willing, as Solon said,<cit><quote type="verse"><l met="e">I grow old learning ever more and more;</l></quote><bibl>Solon Fr. 10</bibl></cit><note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb"><foreign lang="greek">GHRA/SKW D' AI)EI\ POLLA\ DIDASKO/MENOS</foreign>.  See below, 189a.</note> and zealous to learn as long as one lives, and does not expect to get good sense by the mere arrival of old age.  So to me there is nothing unusual, or unpleasant either, in being tried and tested by Socrates;  in fact, I knew pretty well all the time that our argument would not be about the boys if Socrates were present, but about ourselves. 
<milestone unit="section" n="188c"/>Let me therefore repeat that there is no objection on my part to holding a debate with Socrates after the fashion that he likes;  but you must see how Laches here feels on the matter.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Laches</speaker><p> I have but a single mind,<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">Laches plays with the two meaning of <foreign lang="greek">A(PLOU=N</foreign>&mdash;&ldquo;I am single-minded (simple, straightforward) in such matters, that is, I should rather say, double-minded.&rdquo;</note> Nicias, in regard to discussions, or if you like, a double rather than a single one.  For you might think me a lover, and yet also a hater, of discussions:  for when I hear a man discussing virtue or any kind of wisdom, one who is truly a man and worthy of his argument, I am exceedingly delighted; 
<milestone unit="section" n="188d"/>I take the speaker and his speech together, and observe how they sort and harmonize with each other.  Such a man is exactly what I understand by &ldquo;musical,&rdquo;&mdash;he has tuned himself with the fairest harmony, not that of a lyre or other entertaining instrument, but has made a true concord of his own life between his words and his deeds, not in the Ionian, no, nor in the Phrygian nor in the Lydian, but simply in the Dorian mode,<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">The different modes or scales in Greek music were associated with different moral feelings.  The Dorian was most favored, as having a manly, stately character:  the Ionian was more passionate and contentious.  The Phrygian and Lydian were foreign modes, on the character of which there were various opinions.  <title>Cf. Rep.</title> 398-99</note> which is the sole Hellenic harmony.  Such a man makes me rejoice
<milestone unit="section" n="188e"/>with his utterance, and anyone would judge me then a lover of discussion, so eagerly do I take in what he says:  but a man who shows the opposite character gives me pain, and the better he seems to speak, the more I am pained, with the result, in this case, that I am judged a hater of discussion.  Now of Socrates' words I have no experience, but formerly, I fancy, I have made trial of his deeds;  and there I found him living up to any fine words however freely spoken. 
<milestone unit="page" n="189"/><milestone unit="section" n="189a"/>So if he has that gift as well, his wish is mine, and I should be very glad to be cross-examined by such a man, and should not chafe at learning;  but I too agree with Solon, while adding just one word to his saying:  I should like, as I grow old, to learn more and more, but only from honest folk.  Let him concede to me that my teacher is himself good&mdash;else I shall dislike my lessons and be judged a dunce&mdash;but if you say that my teacher is to be a younger man,
<milestone unit="section" n="189b"/> or one who so far has no reputation, or anything of that sort, I care not a jot.  I therefore invite you, Socrates, both to teach and to refute me as much as you please, and to learn too what I on my part know;  such is the position you hold in my eyes since that day on which you came through the same danger with me,<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">This instance of Socrates' intrepidity (at <placeName key="tgn,6001700">Delium</placeName> cf. above, 181b) is more fully described by Alcibiades in <bibl n="Plat. Sym. 221">Plat. Sym. 221</bibl>.</note> and gave a proof of your own valour which is to be expected of anyone who hopes to justify his good name.  So say whatever you like, leaving out of account
<milestone unit="section" n="189c"/>the difference of our ages.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>You two, it seems, will give us no bound for complaint on the score of your not being ready to join both in advising and in inquiring.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Lysimachus</speaker><p>No, but the matter now rests with us, Socrates;  for I venture to count you as one of us.  So take my place in inquiring on behalf of the young men make out what it is that we want our friends here to tell us, and be our adviser by discussing it with them.  For I find that owing to my age I forget the questions I intend to put, and also the answers I receive;  and if the discussion changes in the middle, my memory goes altogether.  Do you therefore discuss and elucidate our problem
<milestone unit="section" n="189d"/>among yourselves;  and I will listen, and then with my friend Melesias I will act at once upon whatever may be your decision.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Let us do, Nicias and Laches, as Lysimachus and Melesias bid us. Now the questions that we attempted to consider a while ago&mdash;&ldquo;Who have been our teachers in this sort of training? What other persons have we made better?&rdquo;&mdash;are perhaps of a kind on which we might well examine ourselves:
<milestone unit="section" n="189e"/>but I believe this other way of inquiring leads to the same thing, and will probably also start more from the beginning.  For if we happen to know of such and such a thing that by being joined to another thing it makes this thing better, and further, if we are able to get the one joined to the other, we obviously know the thing itself on which we might be consulting as to how it might be best and most easily acquired.  Now I daresay you do not grasp my meaning.  Well, you will grasp it more easily in this way.  If we happen to know
<milestone unit="page" n="190"/><milestone unit="section" n="190a"/>that sight joined to eyes makes those eyes the better for it, and further if we are able to get it joined to eyes, we obviously know what this faculty of sight is, on which we might be consulting as to how it might be best and most easily acquired.  For if we did not know first of all what sight or hearing is, we should hardly prove ourselves consultants or physicians of credit in the matter of eyes or ears, and the best way
<milestone unit="section" n="190b"/>of acquiring sight or hearing.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Laches</speaker><p>Truly spoken, Socrates.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And you know, Laches, at this moment our two friends are inviting us to a consultation as to the way in which virtue may be joined to their sons' souls, and so make them better?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Laches</speaker><p>Yes, indeed,</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then our first requisite is to know what virtue<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">Here, and in what follows, &ldquo;virtue&rdquo; embraces the accomplishments and excellences of a good citizen.</note> is?  For surely, if we had no idea at all what virtue actually is, we could not possibly consult
<milestone unit="section" n="190c"/>with anyone as to how he might best acquire it?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Laches</speaker><p>I certainly think not, Socrates.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then we say, Laches, that we know what it is.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Laches</speaker><p>I suppose we must.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And of that which we know, I presume, we can also say what it is.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Laches</speaker><p>To be sure.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Let us not, therefore, my good friend, inquire forthwith about the whole of virtue, since that may well be too much for us;  but let us first see ifwe are sufficiently provided with knowledge about some part of it. 
<milestone unit="section" n="190d"/>In all likelihood this will make our inquiry easier.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Laches</speaker><p>Yes, let us do as you propose, Socrates.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then which of the parts of virtue shall we choose?  Clearly, I think, that which the art of fighting in armor is supposed to promote;  and that, of course, is generally supposed to be courage, is it not?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Laches</speaker><p>Yes, it generally is, to be sure.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then let our first endeavor be, Laches, to say what courage is:  after that we can proceed to inquire in what way our young men may obtain it,
<milestone unit="section" n="190e"/>in so far as it is to be obtained by means of pursuits and studies.  Come, try and tell me, as I suggest, what is courage.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Laches</speaker><p>On my word, Socrates, that is nothing difficult:  anyone who is willing to stay at his post and face the enemy, and does not run away, you may be sure, is courageous.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Rightly spoken, Laches;  but I fear I am to blame, by not putting it clearly, for your having answered not the intention of my question, but something else.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Laches</speaker><p>What do you mean by that, Socrates?
    <milestone unit="page" n="191"/><milestone unit="section" n="191a"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>I will explain, so far as I can:  let us take that man to be courageous who, as you describe him yourself, stays at his post and fights the enemy.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Laches</speaker><p>I, for one, agree to that.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Yes, and I do too.  But what of this other kind of man, who fights the enemy while fleeing, and not staying?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Laches</speaker><p>How fleeing?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Well, as the Scythians are said to fight, as much fleeing as pursuing;  and as you know Homer says in praise of Aeneas' horses, that they knew <quote type="Verse">&ldquo;how to pursue and to flee in fright full swiftly this way and that way;&rdquo;</quote><bibl n="Hom. Il. 8.107">Hom. Il. 8.107-108</bibl>
    <milestone unit="section" n="191b"/>and he glorifies Aeneas himself for this very knowledge of fright, calling him <quote type="Verse">&ldquo;prompter of fright.&rdquo;</quote><bibl n="Hom. Il. 8.107">Hom. Il. 8.107-108</bibl><note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">Socrates pretends to take the hero's epithet &ldquo;prompter of fright&rdquo; (in the enemy) as meaning that he prompted fright in himself and his side, and so know all about the feeling.</note></p></sp><sp><speaker>Laches</speaker><p>And very properly too, Socrates;  for he was speaking of chariots;  and so are you speaking of the mode of the Scythian horsemen.  That is the way of cavalry fighting but with men-at-arms it is as I state it.<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">i.e., they stand fast at their posts in the ranks (above, 191 A).</note></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Except, perhaps, Laches, in the case of the Spartans. 
<milestone unit="section" n="191c"/>For they say that at <placeName key="perseus,Plataea">Plataea</placeName>, when the Spartans came up to the men with wicker shields, they were not willing to stand and fight against these, but fled;   when, however, the Persian ranks weree broken, the Spartans kept turning round and fighting like cavalry, and so won that great battle.<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">In the final struggle at <placeName key="perseus,Plataea">Plataea</placeName> (<date value="-479">479</date> B.C.) the Spartans at first hesitated before the barrier of wicker shields opposed to them by the Persians;  but by a supreme effort they broke through and defeated the Persians by turning on them in man-to-man combat.  <title>Cf.</title> Herod. ix. 61-2.</note></p></sp><sp><speaker>Laches</speaker><p>What you say is true.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And so this is what I meant just now by sayng that I was to blame for your wrong answer, by putting my question wrongly. 
<milestone unit="section" n="191d"/>For I wanted to have your view not only of brave men-at-arms, but also of courage in cavalry and in the entire warrior class;  and of the courageous not only in war but in the perils of the sea, and all who in disease and poverty, or again in public affairs, are courageous;  and further, all who are not merely courageous against pain or fear, but doughty fighters against desires and pleasures,
<milestone unit="section" n="191e"/>whether standing their ground or turning back upon the foe&mdash;for I take it, Laches, there are courageous people in all these kinds.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Laches</speaker><p>Very much so, Socrates.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then all these are courageous, only some have acquired courage in pleasures, some in pains, some in desires and some in fears, while others, I conceive, have acquired cowardice in these same things.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Laches</speaker><p>To be sure.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>What either of them<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">i.e., courage and cowardice</note> is&mdash;that is what I wanted to know.  So try again, and tell me first   what is this thing, courage, which is the same in all of these cases;  or do you still not comprehend my meaning?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Laches</speaker><p>Not very well.
<milestone unit="page" n="192"/><milestone unit="section" n="192a"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>I mean in this way:  suppose, for instance, I were asking you what is quickness, as we find it in running and harping, in speaking and learning, and in many other activities, and as possessed by us practically in any action worth mentioning, whether of arms or legs, or mouth or voice, or mind:  or do you not use the word so?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Laches</speaker><p>Yes, to be sure.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Well then, suppose someone asked me:  Socrates, what do you mean by this thing which in all cases you term quickness? 
<milestone unit="section" n="192b"/>My reply would be:  The faculty that gets a great deal done in a little time is what I call quickness, whether in a voice or in a race or in any of the other instances.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Laches</speaker><p>Your statement would be quite correct.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>So now try and tell me on your part, Laches, about courage in the same way:  what faculty is it, the same whether in pleasure or in pain or in any of the things in which we said just now it was to be found, that has been singled out by the name of courage?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Laches</speaker><p>  Well then, I take it to be a certain endurance of the soul, if I am to speak of the natural quality that appears in them all.
<milestone unit="section" n="192c"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Why, of course we must, if we are each to answer the other's actual question.  Now it appears to me that by no means all endurance, as I conceive it, can appear to you to be courage.  And my grounds for thinking so are these:  I am almost certain, Laches, that you rank courage among the nobler qualities.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Laches</speaker><p>Nay, among the noblest, you may be quite certain.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And endurance joined with wisdom is noble and good?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Laches</speaker><p>Very much so.
<milestone unit="section" n="192d"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>But what of it when joined with folly?  Is it not, on the contrary, hurtful and mischievous?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Laches</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And can you say that such a thing is noble, when it is both mischievous and hurtful?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Laches</speaker><p>Not with any justice, Socrates.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then you will not admit that such an endurance is courage, seeing that it is not noble, whereas courage is a noble quality.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Laches</speaker><p>That is true.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>So, by your account, wise endurance will be courage.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Laches</speaker><p>Apparently.
<milestone unit="section" n="192e"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Now let us see in what it is wise.  In all things, whether great or small?  For instance, if a man endures in spending money wisely, because he knows that by spending he will gain more, would you call him courageous?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Laches</speaker><p>On my word, not I.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Or what do you call it in the case of a doctor who, when his son or anyone else is suffering from inflammation of the lungs and begs for something to drink or eat, inflexibly and enduringly refuses?
<milestone unit="page" n="193"/><milestone unit="section" n="193a"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Laches</speaker><p>That is no case of it, in any sense, either.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Well now, when a man endures in war, and is willing to fight, on a wise calculation whereby he knows that others will come to his aid, and that the forces against him will be fewer and feebler than those who are with him, and when he has besides the advantage of position,&mdash;would you say of this man, if he endures with such wisdom and preparation, that he, or a man in the opposing army who is willing to stand up against him and endure, is the more courageous?
<milestone unit="section" n="193b"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Laches</speaker><p>The man opposed to him, I should say, Socrates.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>But yet his endurance is more foolish than that of the first man.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Laches</speaker><p>That is true.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>So you would say that he who in a cavalry fight endures with a knowledge of horsemanship is less courageous than he who endures without it.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Laches</speaker><p>Yes, I think so.
<milestone unit="section" n="193c"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And he who endures with a skill in slinging or shooting or other such art.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Laches</speaker><p>To be sure.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And anyone who agrees to descend into a well, and to dive, and to endure in this or other such action, without being an adept in these things, you would say is more courageous than the adepts.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Laches</speaker><p>Yes, for what else can one say, Socrates?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Nothing, provided one thinks so.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Laches</speaker><p>But I do think it.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And you observe, I suppose, Laches, that persons of this sort are more foolish in their risks and endurances than those who do it with proper skill.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Laches</speaker><p>Evidently.
<milestone unit="section" n="193d"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Now, we found before that foolish boldness and endurance are base and hurtful?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Laches</speaker><p>Quite so.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>But courage was admitted to be something noble.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Laches</speaker><p>Yes, it was.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Whereas now, on the contrary, we say that this base thing&mdash;foolish endurance&mdash;is courage.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Laches</speaker><p>Apparently.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then do you think our statement is correct?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Laches</speaker><p>On my word, Socrates, not I.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Hence I presume that, on your showing, you and I, Laches,
<milestone unit="section" n="193e"/>are not tuned to the Dorian harmony:  for our deeds do not accord with our words.  By our deeds, most likely, the world might judge us to have our share of courage, but not by our words, I fancy, if they should hear the way we are talking now.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Laches</speaker><p>That is very true.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p> Well now, does it seem right that we should be in such a condition?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Laches</speaker><p>Not by any means.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then do you mind if we accept our statement to a certain point?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Laches</speaker><p>To what point do you mean, and what statement?
<milestone unit="page" n="194"/><milestone unit="section" n="194a"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>That which enjoins endurance.  And, if you please, let us too be steadfast and enduring in our inquiry, so as not to be ridiculed by courage herself for failing to be courageous in our search for her, when we might perchance find after all that this very endurance is courage.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Laches</speaker><p>For my part I am ready, Socrates, to continue without faltering;  and yet I am unaccustomed to discussions of this sort.  But a certain ambitious ardour has got hold of me at hearing what has been said,
<milestone unit="section" n="194b"/>and I am truly vexed at finding myself unable to express offhand what I think.  For I feel that I conceive in thought what courage is, but somehow or other she has given me the slip for the moment, so that I fail to lay hold of her in speech and state what she is.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Well, my dear sir, the good huntsman must follow the hounds and not give up the chase.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Laches</speaker><p>Yes, indeed, by all means.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then do you agree to our inviting Nicias here to join in our hunt?  He may be more resourceful than we are.
<milestone unit="section" n="194c"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Laches</speaker><p>I agree, of course.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Come now, Nicias, and use what powers you have to assist your friends, who are caught in a storm of argument and are quite perplexed.  You see the perplexity of our case;  you must now tell us what you think courage is, and so at once set us free from our perplexity and give your own thoughts the stability of speech.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Nicias</speaker><p>Well, for some time I have been thinking, Socrates, that you two are not defining courage in the right way;  for you are not acting upon an admirable remark which I have formerly heard you make.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>What is that, Nicias?
<milestone unit="section" n="194d"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Nicias</speaker><p>I have often heard you say that every man is good in that wherein he is wise, and bad in that wherein he is unlearned.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Well, that is true, Nicias, I must say.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Nicias</speaker><p>And hence, if the brave man is good, clearly he must be wise.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Do you hear him, Laches?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Laches</speaker><p>I do, without understanding very well what he says.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>But I think I understand it:  our friend appears to me to mean that courage is a kind of wisdom.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Laches</speaker><p>What kind of wisdom, Socrates?
<milestone unit="section" n="194e"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Well, will you put that question to your friend here?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Laches</speaker><p>I do.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Come now, tell him, Nicias, what kind of wisdom courage may be, by your account.  Not that, I presume, of flute-playing.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Nicias</speaker><p>Not at all.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Nor yet that of harping.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Nicias</speaker><p>Oh, no.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>But what is this knowledge then, or of what?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Laches</speaker><p>I must say you question him quite correctly, Socrates, so let him just tell us what he thinks it is.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Nicias</speaker><p>I say, Laches, that it is this&mdash;the knowledge of what is to be dreaded or dared,
<milestone unit="page" n="195"/><milestone unit="section" n="195a"/>either in war or in anything else.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Laches</speaker><p>How strangely he talks, Socrates!</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>What is it that makes you say that, Laches?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Laches</speaker><p>What is it?  Why, surely wisdom is distinct from courage.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Well, Nicias denies that.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Laches</speaker><p>He does indeed, to be sure:  that is where he just babbles.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then let us instruct and not abuse him.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Nicias</speaker><p>No, it seems to me, Socrates, that Laches wants to have it proved that I am talking nonsense, because he was proved
<milestone unit="section" n="195b"/>a moment ago to be in the same case himself.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Laches</speaker><p>Quite so, Nicias, and I will try to make it evident.  You are talking nonsense:  for instance, do not doctors know what is to be dreaded in disease?  Or do you suppose that the courageous know this?  Or do you call doctors courageous</p></sp><sp><speaker>Nicias</speaker><p>No, not at all.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Laches</speaker><p>Nor, I fancy, farmers either.  And yet they, I presume, know what is to be dreaded in farming, and every other skilled worker knows what is to be dreaded and dared in his own craft;  but they are none the more
<milestone unit="section" n="195c"/>courageous for that.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>What is Laches saying, in your opinion, Nicias?  There does seem to be something in it.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Nicias</speaker><p> Yes, there is something, only it is not true.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>How so?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Nicias</speaker><p>Because he thinks that doctors know something more, in treating sick persons, than how to tell what is healthy and what diseased.  This, I imagine, is all that they know:  but to tell whether health itself is to be dreaded by anyone rather than sickness, &mdash;do you suppose, Laches, that this is within a doctor's knowledge?  Do you not think that for many it is better
<milestone unit="section" n="195d"/>that they should never arise from their bed of sickness?  Pray tell me, do you say that in every case it is better to live?  Is it not often preferable to be dead?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Laches</speaker><p>I do think that is so.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Nicias</speaker><p>And do you think that the same things are to be dreaded by those who were better dead, as by those who had better live?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Laches</speaker><p>No, I do not.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Nicias</speaker><p>Well, do you attribute the judgement of this matter to doctors or to any other skilled worker except him who has knowledge of what is to be dreaded and what is not&mdash;the man whom I call courageous?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Do you comprehend his meaning, Laches?
<milestone unit="section" n="195e"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Laches</speaker><p>I do:  it seems to be the seers whom he calls the courageous:  for who else can know for which of us it is better to be alive than dead?  And yet, Nicias, do you avow yourself to be a seer, or to be neither a seer nor courageous?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Nicias</speaker><p>What!  Is it now a seer, think you, who has the gift of judging what is to be dreaded and what to be dared?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Laches</speaker><p>That is my view:  who else could it be?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Nicias</speaker><p>Much rather the man of whom I speak, my dear sir:  for the seer's business is to judge only the signs of what is yet to come&mdash;whether a man is to meet with death or disease or loss of property,
<milestone unit="page" n="196"/><milestone unit="section" n="196a"/>or victory or defeat in war or some other contest;  but what is better among these things for a man to suffer or avoid suffering, can surely be no more for a seer to decide than for anyone else in the world.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Laches</speaker><p>Well, I fail to follow him, Socrates, or to see what he is driving at;  for he points out that neither a seer nor a doctor nor anybody else is the man he refers to as the courageous, unless perchance he means it is some god.  Now it appears to me
<milestone unit="section" n="196b"/>that Nicias is unwilling to admit honestly that he has no meaning at all, but dodges this way and that in the hope of concealing his own perplexity.  Why, you and I could have dodged in the same way just now, if we wished to avoid the appearance of contradicting ourselves.  Of course, if we were arguing in a law-court, there would be some reason for so doing;  but here, in a meeting like this of ours, why waste time in adorning oneself with empty words?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>I agree that it is out of place, Laches:  but let us see: 
<milestone unit="section" n="196c"/>perhaps Nicias thinks he does mean something, and is not talking just for the sake of talking.  So let us ask him to explain more clearly what is in his mind;  and if we find that he means something, we will agree with him;  if not, we will instruct him.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Laches</speaker><p>Then, Socrates, if you would like to ask him, please do so:  I daresay I have done enough asking.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Well, I see no objection, since the question will be on behalf of us both.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Laches</speaker><p>Very well, then.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Now tell me, Nicias, or rather, tell us&mdash;for Laches and I are sharing the argument between us&mdash;do you say that courage is knowledge
<milestone unit="section" n="196d"/>of what is to be dreaded or dared?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Nicias</speaker><p>I do.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And that it is not every man that knows it, since neither a doctor nor a seer can know it, and cannot be courageous unless he add this particular knowledge to his own?  This was your statement, was it not?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Nicias</speaker><p>Yes, it was.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And so in fact this is not a thing which, as the proverb says, &ldquo;any pig would know&rdquo;;  and thus a pig cannot be courageous.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Nicias</speaker><p>I think not.
<milestone unit="section" n="196e"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Indeed it is obvious, Nicias, that you at least do not believe that even the Crommyonian sow<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">The fierce moster slain by Theseus in the region between <placeName key="perseus,Corinth">Corinth</placeName> and <placeName key="perseus,Megara">Megara</placeName> before he became the hero of <placeName key="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName>.</note> could have been courageous.  I say this not in jest, but because I conceive it is necessary for him who states this theory to refuse courage to any wild beast, or else to admit that a beast like a lion or a leopard or even a boar is so wise as to know what only a few men know because it is so hard to perceive.  Why, he who subscribes to your account of courage must needs agree that a lion, a stag, a bull, and a monkey have all an equal share of courage in their nature.
<milestone unit="page" n="197"/><milestone unit="section" n="197a"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Laches</speaker><p>Heavens, Socrates, how admirably you argue!  Now answer us sincerely, Nicias, and say whether those animals, which we all admit to be courageous, are wiser than we are;  or whether you dare, in contradiction of everyone else, describe them as not even courageous.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Nicias</speaker><p>No, Laches, I do not describe animals, or anything else that from thoughtlessness has no fear of the dreadful, as courageous, but rather as fearless and foolish.  Or do you suppose I describe all children
<milestone unit="section" n="197b"/>as courageous, that have no fear because they are thoughtless?  I rather hold that the fearless and the courageous are not the same thing.  In my opinion very few people are endowed with courage and forethought, while rashness, boldness, and fearlessness, with no forethought to guide it, are found in a great number of men, women, children, and animals.  So you see, the acts that you and most people call courageous, I call rash, and it is the prudent acts
<milestone unit="section" n="197c"/>which I speak of that are courageous.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Laches</speaker><p>Mark you, Socrates, how finely, as he fancies, my friend decks himself out with his words!  And how he attempts to deprive of the distinction of courage those whom everyone admits to be courageous!</p></sp><sp><speaker>Nicias</speaker><p>I am not referring to you, Laches, so do not be fiightened:  for I grant that you, and Lamachus also, are wise, since you are courageous, and I say the same of numerous other Athenians.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Laches</speaker><p>I will not say what I could say in answer to that, lest you call me a true son of Aexone.<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">A deme or district of <placeName key="tgn,7002681">Attica</placeName>, noted for the abusive wit of its people.</note>
<milestone unit="section" n="197d"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>No, say nothing, Laches:  for in fact you seem to me to have failed to perceive that he has acquired his wisdom from <placeName key="tgn,2274807">Damon</placeName>, our good friend;  and <placeName key="tgn,2274807">Damon</placeName> constantly associates with Prodicus, who is supposed to be the cleverest of the sophists at distinguishing terms like these.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Laches</speaker><p>Yes, for it is more suitable, Socrates, for a sophist to make a show of such refinements than for a man whom the State thinks worthy to govern her.
<milestone unit="section" n="197e"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Indeed it is suitable, I presume, my amiable friend, for a man in the highest seat of government to be gifted with the highest degree of wisdom. But it seems to me that Nicias is worthy of further attention, so that we may learn in what connexion he uses this word &ldquo;courage.&rdquo;</p></sp><sp><speaker>Laches</speaker><p>Then attend to him yourself, Socrates.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p> That is what I propose to do, my good sir:  still, you are not to think that I will release you from your due share of the argument.  No, you must put your mind to it and join in weighing well what is said.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Laches</speaker><p>Well, so be it, if you think that I ought.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Indeed I do.  Now, Nicias, please go back to the beginning<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">Cf. 190 c.</note> and answer us: 
<milestone unit="page" n="198"/><milestone unit="section" n="198a"/>you know we started our discussion by considering courage as a part of virtue?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Nicias</speaker><p> Quite so.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And you joined in this answer,&mdash;that it is a part, there being also other parts, which taken all together have received the name of virtue.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Nicias</speaker><p>Why, of course.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Now, do you mean the same as I do by these?  Besides courage, I refer to temperance, justice, and other similar qualities.  And you also, do you not?
<milestone unit="section" n="198b"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Nicias</speaker><p>Certainly I do.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>So much for that;  thus far we agree:  but let us pass on to what is to be dreaded and what to be dared, and make sure that you and we do not take two different views of these.  Let me tell you our view of them, and if you do not agree with it, you shall instruct us.  We hold that the dreadful are things that cause fear, and the safely ventured are those that do not;  and fear is caused not by past or present, but by expected evils:  for fear is expectation of coming evil.  You are of the same mind with us in this, are you not, Laches?
<milestone unit="section" n="198c"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Laches</speaker><p>Yes, entirely so, Socrates.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>So there you have our view, Nicias,&mdash;that coming evils are to be dreaded, and things not evil, or good things, that are to come are to be safely dared.  Would you describe them in this way, or in some other?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Nicias</speaker><p>I would describe them in this way.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And the knowledge of these things is what you term courage?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Nicias</speaker><p>Precisely.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>There is still a third point on which we must see if you are in agreement with us.
<milestone unit="section" n="198d"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Nicias</speaker><p>What point is that?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>I will tell you.  It seems to your friend and me that, to take the various subjects of knowledge, there is not one knowledge of how a thing has happened in the past, another of how things are happening in the present, and another of how a thing that has not yet happened might or will happen most favorably in the future, but it is the same knowledge throughout.  For example, in the case of health, it is medicine always and alone that surveys present, past, and future processes alike;
<milestone unit="section" n="198e"/>and farming is in the same position as regards the productions of the earth.  And in matters of war;  I am sure you yourselves will bear me out when I say that here generalship makes the best forecasts on the whole, and particularly of future results, and is the mistress rather than the servant of the seer's art, because it knows better what is happening or about to happen
<milestone unit="page" n="199"/><milestone unit="section" n="199a"/>in the operations of war;  whence the law ordains that the general shall give orders to the seer, and not the seer to the general.  May we say this, Laches?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Laches</speaker><p>We may.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Well now, do you agree with us, Nicias, that the same knowledge has comprehension of the same things, whether future, present, or past?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Nicias</speaker><p>I do, for that is my own opinion, Socrates.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And courage, my good friend, is knowledge of
<milestone unit="section" n="199b"/>what is to be dreaded and dared, as you say, do you not?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Nicias</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And things to be dreaded and things to be dared have been admitted to be either future goods or future evils?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Nicias</speaker><p>Certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And the same knowledge is concerned with the same things, whether in the future or in any particular stage?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Nicias</speaker><p>That is so.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then courage is knowledge not merely of what is to be dreaded and what dared, for it comprehends goods and evils not merely in the future, but also in the present
<milestone unit="section" n="199c"/>and the past and in any stage, like the other kinds of knowledge.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Nicias</speaker><p>Apparently.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>So the answer that you gave us, Nicias, covers only about a third part of courage;  whereas our question was of what courage is as a whole.  And now it appears, on your own showing, that courage is knowledge not merely of what is to be dreaded and what dared, but practically a knowledge concerning all goods and evils at every stage; 
<milestone unit="section" n="199d"/>such is your present account of what courage must be.  What do you say to this new version, Nicias?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Nicias</speaker><p>I accept it, Socrates.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Now do you think, my excellent friend, there could be anything wanting to the virtue of a man who knew all good things, and all about their production in the present, the future, and the past, and all about evil things likewise?  Do you suppose that such a man could be lacking in temperance, or justice, and holiness, when he alone has the gift of taking due precaution, in his dealings with gods and men,
<milestone unit="section" n="199e"/>as regards what is to be dreaded and what is not, and of procuring good things, owing to his knowledge of the right behaviour towards them?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Nicias</speaker><p>I think, Socrates, there is something in what you say.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Hence what you now describe, Nicias, will be not a part but the whole of virtue.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Nicias</speaker><p>Apparently.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>But, you know, we said that courage is one of the parts of virtue.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Nicias</speaker><p>Yes, we did.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And what we now describe is seen to be different.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Nicias</speaker><p>So it seems.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Thus we have failed to discover, Nicias, what courage really is.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Nicias</speaker><p>Evidently.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Laches</speaker><p>And I, in fact, supposed, my dear Nicias, that you were going to discover it,
<milestone unit="page" n="200"/><milestone unit="section" n="200a"/>when you showed such contempt for the answers I made to Socrates:  indeed I had very great hopes that the wisdom you derived from <placeName key="tgn,2274807">Damon</placeName> would avail you for the discovery.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Nicias</speaker><p>That is all very fine, Laches;  you think you can now make light of the fact that you were yourself shown just now to know nothing about courage;  when my turn comes to be shown up in the same light, that is all you care, and now it will not matter to you at all, it seems, if I share your ignorance of things whereof any self-respecting man ought to have knowledge.  You really strike me, indeed,
<milestone unit="section" n="200b"/>as following the average man's practice of keeping an eye on others rather than on oneself:  but I fancy that for the present I have said as much as could be expected on the subject of our discussion, and that later on I must make good any defects in my statement upon it with the help of Damon&mdash;whom I know you choose to ridicule, and that without ever having seen the actual Damon&mdash;and with others' help besides.  And when I have settled the matter I will enlighten you, in no grudging spirit: 
<milestone unit="section" n="200c"/>for I think you are in very great need of instruction.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Laches</speaker><p>You are a man of wisdom, I know, Nicias. But still I advise Lysimachus here and Melesias to dismiss you and me, and to retain our friend Socrates as I said at first, for the education of your boys:  were my own sons old enough, I should do the same thing too.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Nicias</speaker><p>For my part I agree;  if Socrates will consent to take charge of these young people, I will seek for no one else. 
<milestone unit="section" n="200d"/>I should be only too glad to entrust him with Niceratus, if he should consent:  but when I begin to mention the matter to him, he always recommends other men to me and refuses himself.  Just see, Lysimachus, if Socrates will give you a more favorable hearing.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Lysimachus</speaker><p>It is only right that he should, Nicias, for indeed I would be willing to do many things for him which I would not do for a great many others. Well, what do you say, Socrates?  Will you comply, and lend your endeavours for the highest improvement of these boys?
<milestone unit="section" n="200e"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Why, how strange it would be, Lysimachus, to refuse to lend one's endeavours for the highest improvement of anybody!  Now if in the debates that we have just held I had been found to know what our two friends did not know, it would be right to make a point of inviting me to take up this work:  but as it is, we have all got into the same difficulty, so why should one of us be preferred to another?  In my own opinion, none of us should;  and this being so,
<milestone unit="page" n="201"/><milestone unit="section" n="201a"/>perhaps you will allow me to give you a piece of advice.  I tell you, gentlemen&mdash;and this is confidential&mdash;that we ought all alike to seek out the best teacher we can find, first for ourselves&mdash;for we need one&mdash;and then for our boys, sparing neither expense nor anything else we can do:  but to leave ourselves as we now are, this I do not advise.  And if anyone makes fun of us for seeing fit
    <milestone unit="section" n="201b"/>to go to school at our time of life, I think we should appeal to Homer, who said that <quote type="verse paraphrase">&ldquo;shame is no good mate for a needy man.&rdquo;</quote><bibl n="Hom. Od. 17.347">Hom. Od. 17.347</bibl> So let us not mind what anyone may say, but join together in arraging for our own and the boys' tuition.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Lysimachus</speaker><p>I gladly approve of your suggestions, Socrates;  and as I am the oldest, so I am the most eager to have lessons with the young ones.  Now this is what I ask you to do: 
<milestone unit="section" n="201c"/>come to my house tomorrow at daybreak;  be sure not to fail, and then we shall consult on this very matter.  For the present, let us break up our meeting.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>I will not fail, Lysimachus, to come to you tomorrow, God willing.</p></sp></body></text>

Then Hippothales, as he saw me approaching, said: Socrates, whither away, and whence?
<milestone unit="section" n="203b"/> From the Academy, I replied, on my way straight to the Lyceum.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Come over here, he said, straight to us.  You will not put in here?  But you may as well.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Where do you mean?  I asked; and what is your company?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Here, he said, showing me there, just opposite the wall, a sort of enclosure and a door standing open.  We pass our time there, he went on;  not only we ourselves, but others besides,&mdash;a great many, and handsome. 
<milestone unit="page" n="204"/><milestone unit="section" n="204a"/> And what, pray, is this place, and what your pastime?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>A wrestling school, he said, of recent construction; and our pastime chiefly consists of discussions, in which we should be happy to let you have a share.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>That is very good of you, I said; and who does the teaching there?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Your own comrade, he replied, and supporter, Miccus.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Upon my word, I said, he is no slight person, but a qualified professor.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Then will you please come in with us, he said, so as to see for yourself the company we have there?
<milestone unit="section" n="204b"/> I should be glad to hear first on what terms I am to enter, and which is the handsome one.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Each of us, he replied, has a different fancy, Socrates.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Well, and which is yours, Hippothales?  Tell me that.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>At this question he blushed; so I said: Ah, Hippothales, son of Hieronymus, you need not trouble to tell me whether you are in love with somebody or not: for I know you are not only in love, but also far advanced already in your passion.  In everything else I may be a poor useless creature,
<milestone unit="section" n="204c"/>but there is one gift that I have somehow from heaven,&mdash;to be able to recognize quickly a lover or a beloved.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When he heard this, he blushed much more than ever.  Then Ctesippus remarked:  Quite charming, the way you blush, Hippothales, and shrink from telling Socrates the name; yet, if he spends but a little time with you, he will find you a regular torment, as he hears you repeat it again and again.  He has deafened our ears, I can tell you, Socrates, by cramming them with &ldquo;Lysis&rdquo;:
<milestone unit="section" n="204d"/>let him be a trifle in liquor, and as likely as not we start out of our sleep fancying we hear the name of Lysis.  The descriptions he gives us in conversation, though dreadful enough, are not so very bad: it is when he sets about inundating us with his poems and prose compositions.  More dreadful than all, he actually sings about his favorite in an extraordinary voice, which we have the trial of hearing.  And now, at a question from you, he blushes!<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Lysis apparently, I said, is somebody quite young:
<milestone unit="section" n="204e"/>this I infer from the fact that I did not recognize the name when I heard it.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>That is because they do not usually call him by his name, he replied; he still goes by his paternal title,<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">i.e., &ldquo;son of Democrates&rdquo; (see below)</note> as his father is so very well known.  You must, I am sure, be anything but ignorant of the boy's appearance:  that alone would be enough to know him by.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Let me hear, I said, whose son he is.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The eldest son, he replied, of Democrates of Aexone.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Ah well, I said, Hippothales, what an altogether noble and gallant love you have discovered there!  Now please go on and give me a performance like those that you give your friends here,
<milestone unit="page" n="205"/><milestone unit="section" n="205a"/>so that I may know whether you understand what a lover ought to say of his favorite to his face or to others.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Do you attach any weight, Socrates, he asked, to anything you have heard this fellow say?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Tell me, I said; do you deny being in love with the person he mentions?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Not I, he replied; but I do deny that I make poems and compositions on my favorite.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>He is in a bad way, said Ctesippus; why, he raves like a madman!<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Then I remarked:  Hippothales, I do not want to hear your verses,
<milestone unit="section" n="205b"/>or any ode that you may have indited to the youth; I only ask for their purport, that I may know your manner of dealing with your favorite.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>I expect this fellow will tell you, he replied:  he has an accurate knowledge and recollection of them, if there is any truth in what he says of my having dinned them so constantly in his ears.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Quite so, on my soul, said Ctesippus; and a ridiculous story it is too, Socrates.  To be a lover, and to be singularly intent on one's boy, yet to have nothing particular to tell him that a mere boy could not say, is surely ridiculous:
<milestone unit="section" n="205c"/>but he only writes and relates things that the whole city sings of, recalling Democrates and the boy's grandfather Lysis and all his ancestors, with their wealth and the horses they kept, and their victories at <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName>, the Isthmus, and <placeName key="perseus,Nemea">Nemea</placeName>,<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">The Pythian Games were held at <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName>, the Isthmian near <placeName key="perseus,Corinth">Corinth</placeName>, and the Nemean at <placeName key="perseus,Nemea">Nemea</placeName>, between <placeName key="perseus,Corinth">Corinth</placeName> and <placeName key="perseus,Argos">Argos</placeName>.</note> with chariot-teams and coursers, and, in addition, even hoarier antiquities than these.  Only two days ago he was recounting to us in some poem of his the entertainment of Hercules,&mdash;how on account of his kinship with Hercules their forefather welcomed the hero,
<milestone unit="section" n="205d"/>being himself the offspring of Zeus and of the daughter of their deme's founder; such old wives' tales, and many more of the sort, Socrates,&mdash;these are the things he tells and trolls, while compelling us to be his audience.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>When I heard this I said: Oh, you ridiculous Hippothales, do you compose and chant a triumph song on yourself, before you have won your victory?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>It is not on myself, Socrates, he replied, that I either compose or chant it.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>You think not, I said.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Then what is the truth of it? he asked.
<milestone unit="section" n="205e"/> Most certainly, I replied, it is you to whom these songs refer.  For if you prevail on your favorite, and he is such as you describe, all that you have spoken and sung will be so much glory to you, and a veritable eulogy upon your triumph in having secured such a favorite as that: whereas if he eludes your grasp, the higher the terms of your eulogy of your favorite, the greater will seem to be the charms and virtues you have lost, and you will be ridiculed accordingly.  Hence anyone who deals wisely in love-matters,
<milestone unit="page" n="206"/><milestone unit="section" n="206a"/>my friend, does not praise his beloved until he prevails, for fear of what the future may have in store for him.  And besides, these handsome boys, when so praised and extolled, become full of pride and haughtiness:  do you not think so?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>I do, he said.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And then, the haughtier they are, the harder grows the task of capturing them?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Yes, apparently.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And what do you think of a hunter who should scare away his quarry in hunting and make it harder to catch?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Clearly he would be a poor one.
<milestone unit="section" n="206b"/> And hence to use speech and song, not for charming but for driving wild, would be gross fatuity, would it not?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>I think so.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Then take care, Hippothales, not to make yourself guilty of all these things by your verse-making; and yet I fancy you will not like to allow that a man who damages himself by poetry can be a good poet, so long as he is damaging to himself.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>On my soul, no, he said; of course it would be most absurd.  But this is the very reason, Socrates, why I impart my feelings to you,
<milestone unit="section" n="206c"/>and ask you for any useful advice you can give as to what conversation or conduct will help to endear one to one's favorite.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>That is not an easy thing to tell, I replied; but if you will agree to get him to have a talk with me, I daresay I could show you an example of the conversation you should hold with him, instead of those things that your friends say you speak and sing.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>There is no difficulty about that, he said.  If you will go in with Ctesippus here, and take a seat and talk, I think he will come to you of his own accord; he is singularly fond of listening, Socrates,
<milestone unit="section" n="206d"/>and besides, they are keeping the Hermaea,<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">The festival of Hermes, who was specially honored in wrestling schools.</note> so that the youths and boys are all mingled together.  So he will come to you but if he does not, Ctesippus is intimate with him, as being a cousin of Menexenus; for Lysis has chosen Menexenus for his particular friend.  So let Ctesippus call him if you find that he does not come of himself.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>That is what I must do, I said.  Whereupon I took Ctesippus
<milestone unit="section" n="206e"/>with me into the wrestling school, and the others came after us.  When we got inside, we found that the boys had performed the sacrifice in the place and, as the ceremonial business was now almost over, they were all playing at knuckle-bones and wearing their finest attire.  Most of them were playing in the court out-of-doors; but some were at a game of odd-and-even in a corner of the undressing room, with a great lot of knuckle-bones which they drew from little baskets; and there were others standing about them and looking on.  Among these was Lysis: he stood among the boys
<milestone unit="page" n="207"/><milestone unit="section" n="207a"/>and youths with a garland on his head, a distinguished figure, deserving not merely the name of well-favored, but also of well-made and well-bred.  As for us, we went and sat apart on the opposite side&mdash;for it was quiet there&mdash;and started some talk amongst ourselves.  The result was that Lysis ever and anon turned round to observe us, and was obviously eager to join us.  For a while, however, he hesitated, being too shy to approach us alone;
<milestone unit="section" n="207b"/>till Menexenus stepped in for a moment from his game in the court and, on seeing me and Ctesippus, came to take a seat beside us.  When Lysis saw him, he came along too and sat down with Menexenus.  Then all the others came to us also; and I must add that Hippothales, when he saw a good many of them standing there, stood so as to be screened by them, in a position where he thought Lysis would not catch sight of him, as he feared that he might irritate him; in this way he stood by and listened.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Then I, looking at Menexenus, asked him: Son of Demophon, which is the elder of you two?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>It is a point in dispute between us, he replied.
<milestone unit="section" n="207c"/> Then you must also be at variance, I said, as to which is the nobler.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Yes, to be sure, he said.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And moreover, which is the more beautiful, likewise.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>This made them both laugh.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>But of course I shall not ask, I said, which of you is the wealthier; for you are friends, are you not?<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Certainly we are, they replied.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And, you know, friends are said to have everything in common, so that here at least there will be no difference between you, if what you say of your friendship is true.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>They agreed.
<milestone unit="section" n="207d"/> After that I was proceeding to ask them which was the juster and wiser of the two, when I was interrupted by somebody who came and fetched away Menexenus, saying that the wrestling-master was calling him: I understood that he was taking some part in the rites.  So he went off; and then I asked Lysis:  I suppose, Lysis, your father and mother are exceedingly fond of you?  Yes, to be sure, he replied.  Then they would like you to be as happy as possible?
<milestone unit="section" n="207e"/>Yes, of course.  Do you consider that a man is happy when enslaved and restricted from doing everything he desires?  Not I, on my word, he said.  Then if your father and mother are fond of you, and desire to see you happy, it is perfectly plain that they are anxious to secure your happiness.  They must be, of course, he said.  Hence they allow you to do what you like, and never scold you, or hinder you from doing what you desire?  Yes, they do, Socrates, I assure you: they stop me from doing a great many things.  How do you mean?  I said: they wish you
<milestone unit="page" n="208"/><milestone unit="section" n="208a"/>to be happy, and yet hinder you from doing what you like?  But answer me this: suppose you desire to ride in one of your father's chariots and hold the reins in some race; they will not allow you, but will prevent you?  That is so, to be sure, he said; they will not allow me.  But whom would they allow?  There is a driver, in my father's pay.  What do you say?  A hireling, whom they trust rather than you, so that he can do whatever he pleases with the horses; and they pay him besides a salary for doing that!
<milestone unit="section" n="208b"/>Why, of course, he said.  Well, but they trust you with the control of the mule-cart, and if you wanted to take the whip and lash the team, they would let you?  Nothing of the sort, he said.  Why, I asked, is nobody allowed to lash them?  Oh yes, he said, the muleteer.  Is he a slave, or free?  A slave, he replied.  So it seems that they value a slave more highly than you, their son, and entrust him rather than you with their property,
<milestone unit="section" n="208c"/>and allow him to do what he likes, while preventing you?  And now there is one thing more you must tell me.  Do they let you control your own self, or will they not trust you in that either?  Of course they do not, he replied.  But some one controls you?  Yes, he said, my tutor<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">The <foreign lang="greek">PAIDAGWGO/S</foreign> was a trusted slave who was appointed to attend on a boy out of school hours and to have a general control over his conduct and industry.</note> here.  Is he a slave?  Why, certainly; he belongs to us, he said.  What a strange thing, I exclaimed; a free man controlled by a slave!  But how does this tutor actually exert his control over you?  By taking me to school, I suppose, he replied.  And your schoolmasters, can it be that they also control you?
<milestone unit="section" n="208d"/>I should think they do!  Then quite a large number of masters and controllers are deliberately set over you by your father.  But when you come home to your mother, she surely lets you do what you like, that she may make you happy, either with her wool or her loom, when she is weaving?  I take it she does not prevent you from handling her batten, or her comb, or any other of her wool-work implements.  At this he laughed and said: I promise you, Socrates, not only does she prevent me, but I should get a beating as well,
<milestone unit="section" n="208e"/>if I laid hands on them.  Good heavens!  I said; can it be that you have done your father or mother some wrong?  On my word, no, he replied.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Well, what reason can they have for so strangely preventing you from being happy and doing what you like?  Why do they maintain you all day long in constant servitude to somebody, so that, in a word, you do hardly a single thing that you desire?  And thus, it would seem, you get no advantage from all your great possessions&mdash;
<milestone unit="page" n="209"/><milestone unit="section" n="209a"/>nay, anyone else controls them rather than you&mdash;nor from your own person, though so well-born, which is also shepherded and managed by another; while you, Lysis, control nobody, and do nothing that you desire.  It is because I am not yet of age, Socrates, he said.  That can hardly be the hindrance, son of Democrates, since there is a certain amount, I imagine, that your father and mother entrust to you without waiting until you come of age.  For when they want some reading or writing done for them, it is you,
<milestone unit="section" n="209b"/>I conceive, whom they appoint to do it before any others of the household.  Is it not so?  Quite so, he replied.  And you are free there to choose which letter you shall write first and which second, and you have a like choice in reading.  And, I suppose, when you take your lyre, neither your father nor your mother prevents you from tightening or slackening what string you please, or from using your finger or your plectrum at will: or do they prevent you?  Oh, no.  Then whatever can be the reason, Lysis, why they do not prevent you here,
<milestone unit="section" n="209c"/>while in the matters we were just mentioning they do?  I suppose, he said, because I understand these things, but not those others.  Very well, I said, my excellent friend: so it is not your coming of age that your father is waiting for, as the time for entrusting you with everything; but on the day when he considers you to have a better intelligence than himself, he will entrust you with himself and all that is his.  Yes, I think so, he said.  Very well, I went on, but tell me, does not your neighbor observe the same rule as your father towards you?  Do you think he will entrust you with the management of his house, as soon as he considers you to have a better idea
<milestone unit="section" n="209d"/>of its management than himself, or will he direct it himself?  I should say he would entrust it to me.  Well then, do you not think that the Athenians will entrust you with their affairs, when they perceive that you have sufficient intelligence?  I do.  Ah, do let me ask this, I went on: what, pray, of the Great King?  Would he allow his eldest son, heir-apparent to the throne of <placeName key="tgn,1000004">Asia</placeName>, to put what he chose into the royal stew,
<milestone unit="section" n="209e"/>or would he prefer us to do it, supposing we came before him and convinced him that we had a better notion than his son of preparing a tasty dish?  Clearly he would prefer us, he said.  And he would not allow the prince to put in the smallest bit, whereas he would let us have our way even if we wanted to put in salt by the handful.  Why, of course.  Again, if his son has something the matter with his eyes, would he let him meddle with them himself, if he considered him to be no doctor,
<milestone unit="page" n="210"/><milestone unit="section" n="210a"/>or would he prevent him?  He would prevent him.  But if he supposed us to have medical skill, he would not prevent us, I imagine, even though we wanted to pull the eyes open and sprinkle them with ashes, so long as he believed our judgement to be sound.  That is true.  So he would entrust us, rather than himself or his son, with all his other affairs besides, wherever he felt we were more skilled than they?  Necessarily, he said, Socrates.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>The case then, my dear Lysis, I said, stands thus: with regard to matters
<milestone unit="section" n="210b"/>in which we become intelligent, every one will entrust us with them, whether Greeks or foreigners, men or women and in such matters we shall do as we please, and nobody will care to obstruct us.  Nay, not only shall we ourselves be free and have control of others in these affairs, but they will also belong to us, since we shall derive advantage from them; whereas in all those for which we have failed to acquire intelligence, so far will anyone be from permitting us to deal with them as we think fit, that everybody will do his utmost to obstruct us&mdash;
<milestone unit="section" n="210c"/>not merely strangers, but father and mother and any more intimate person than they; and we on our part shall be subject to others in such matters, which will be no concern of ours, since we shall draw no advantage from them.  Do you agree to this account of the case?  I agree.  Then will anyone count us his friends or have any affection for us in those matters for which we are useless?  Surely not, he said.  So now, you see, your father does not love you, nor does anyone love anyone else, so far as one is useless.  Apparently not, he said.  Then if you can become wise, my boy,
<milestone unit="section" n="210d"/>everybody will be your friend, every one will be intimate with you, since you will be useful and good; otherwise, no one at all, not your father, nor your mother, nor your intimate connections, will be your friends.  Now is it possible, Lysis, to have a high notion of yourself in matters of which you have as yet no notion?  Why, how can I?  he said.  Then if you are in need of a teacher, you have as yet no notion of things?  True.  Nor can you have a great notion of yourself, if you are still notionless.  Upon my word, Socrates, he said, I do not see how I can.
<milestone unit="section" n="210e"/> On hearing him answer this, I glanced at Hippothales, and nearly made a blunder, for it came into my mind to say:  This is the way, Hippothales, in which you should talk to your favorite, humbling and reducing him, instead of puffing him up and spoiling him, as you do now.  Well, I noticed that he was in an agony of embarrassment at what we had been saying, and I remembered how, in standing near, he wished to hide himself from Lysis.
<milestone unit="page" n="211"/><milestone unit="section" n="211a"/>So I checked myself and withheld this remark.  In the meantime, Menexenus came back, and sat down by Lysis in the place he had left on going out.  Then Lysis, in a most playful, affectionate manner, unobserved by Menexenus, said softly to me:  Socrates, tell Menexenus what you have been saying to me.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>To which I replied:  You shall tell it him yourself, Lysis; for you gave it your closest attention.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>I did, indeed, he said.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Then try, I went on, to recollect it as well as you can,
<milestone unit="section" n="211b"/>so that you tell him the whole of it clearly: but if you forget any of it, mind that you ask me for it again when next you meet me.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>I will do so, Socrates, he said, by all means, I assure you.  But tell him something else, that I may hear it too, until it is time to go home.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Well, I must do so, I said, since it is you who bid me.  But be ready to come to my support, in case Menexenus attempts to refute me.  You know what a keen disputant he is.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Yes, on my word, very keen; that is why I want you to have a talk with him.
<milestone unit="section" n="211c"/> So that I may make myself ridiculous?  I said.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>No, no, indeed, he replied I want you to trounce him.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>How can I?  I asked.  It is not easy, when the fellow is so formidable&mdash;a pupil of Ctesippus.  And here&mdash;do you not see?&mdash;is Ctesippus himself.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Take no heed of anyone, Socrates, he said; just go on and have a talk with him.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>I must comply, I said.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now, as these words passed between us,&mdash;What is this feast, said Ctesippus, that you two are having by yourselves, without allowing us a share in your talk?
<milestone unit="section" n="211d"/> Well, well, I replied, we must give you a share.  My friend here fails to understand something that I have been saying, but tells me he thinks Menexenus knows, and he urges me to question him.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Why not ask him then?  said he.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>But I am going to, I replied.  Now please answer, Menexenus, whatever question I may ask you.  There is a certain possession that I have desired from my childhood, as every one does in his own way.  One person wants to get possession of horses,
<milestone unit="section" n="211e"/>another dogs, another money, and another distinctions:  of these things I reck little, but for the possession of friends I have quite a passionate longing, and would rather obtain a good friend than the best quail or cock in the world; yes, and rather, I swear, than any horse or dog.  I believe, indeed, by the Dog, that rather than all Darius's gold I would choose to gain a dear comrade&mdash;far sooner than I would Darius himself, so fond I am of my comrades.
<milestone unit="page" n="212"/><milestone unit="section" n="212a"/>Accordingly, when I see you and Lysis together, I am quite beside myself, and congratulate you on being able, at such an early age, to gain this possession so quickly and easily; since you, Menexenus, have so quickly and surely acquired his friendship, and he likewise yours: whereas I am so far from acquiring such a thing, that I do not even know in what way one person becomes a friend of another, and am constrained to ask you about this very point, in view of your experience.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now tell me: when one person loves another, which of the two becomes friend of the other&mdash;
<milestone unit="section" n="212b"/>the loving of the loved, or the loved of the loving?  Or is there no difference?  There is none, he replied, in my opinion.  How is that? I said; do you mean that both become friends mutually, when there is only one loving the other?  Yes, I think so, he replied.  But I ask you, is it not possible for one loving not to be loved by him whom he loves?  It is.  But again, may he not be even hated while loving?  This, I imagine, is the sort of thing that lovers do sometimes seem to incur with their favorites:
<milestone unit="section" n="212c"/>they love them with all their might, yet they feel either that they are not loved in return, or that they are actually hated.  Or do you not think this is true?  Very true, he replied.  Now in such a case, I went on, the one loves and the other is loved?  Yes.  Which of the two, then, is a friend of the other?  Is the loving a friend of the loved, whether in fact he is loved in return or is even hated, or is the loved a friend of the loving?  Or again, is neither of them in such a case friend of the other, if both do not love mutually?
<milestone unit="section" n="212d"/>At any rate, he said, it looks as if this were so.  So you see, we now hold a different view from what we held before.  At first we said that if one of them loved, both were friends:  but now, if both do not love, neither is a friend.  It looks like it, he said.  So there is no such thing as a friend for the lover who is not loved in return.  Apparently not.  And so we find no horse-lovers where the horses do not love in return, no quail-lovers, dog-lovers, wine-lovers, or sport-lovers on such terms, nor any lovers of wisdom if she returns not their love.  Or does each person love these things,
<milestone unit="section" n="212e"/>while yet failing to make friends of them, and was it a lying poet who said&mdash;<quote type="verse"><l met="elegiac">Happy to have your children as friends, and your trampling horses,</l><l>Scent-snuffing hounds, and a host when you travel abroad?</l></quote><bibl>Solon 21.2.</bibl><milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>I do not think so, he said.  But do you think he spoke the truth?  Yes.  Then the loved object is a friend to the lover, it would seem, Menexenus, alike whether it loves or hates: for instance, new-born children,
<milestone unit="page" n="213"/><milestone unit="section" n="213a"/>who have either not begun to love, or already hate, if punished by their mother or their father, are yet at that very moment, and in spite of their hate, especially and pre-eminently friends to their parents.  I think, he said, that is the case.  Then this argument shows that it is not the lover who is a friend, but the loved.  Apparently.  And it is the hated who is an enemy, not the hater.  Evidently.  Then people must often be loved by their enemies, and hated by their friends, and be friends to their enemies and enemies to their friends,
<milestone unit="section" n="213b"/>if the loved object is a friend rather than the loving agent.  And yet it is a gross absurdity, my dear friend&mdash;I should say rather, an impossibility&mdash;that one should be an enemy to one's friend and a friend to one's enemy.  You appear to be right there, Socrates, he said.  Then if that is impossible, it is the loving that must be a friend of the loved.  Evidently.  And so the hating, on the other hand, will be an enemy of the hated.  Necessarily.  Hence in the end we shall find ourselves compelled to agree
<milestone unit="section" n="213c"/>to the same statement as we made before, that frequently a man is a friend of one who is no friend, and frequently even of an enemy, when he loves one who loves not, or even hates; while frequently a man may be an enemy of one who is no enemy or even a friend, when he hates one who hates not, or even loves.<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">In this argument Socrates makes play, like one of the &ldquo;eristic&rdquo; sophists, with the ambiguous meaning of <foreign lang="greek">FI/LOS</foreign> (&ldquo;friend&rdquo; or &ldquo;dear&rdquo;) and <foreign lang="greek">E)XQRO/S</foreign> (&ldquo;enemy&rdquo; or &ldquo;hateful&rdquo;).  Beneath his immediate purpose of puzzling the young man lies the intention of pointing out the obscurity of the very terms &ldquo;friend&rdquo; and &ldquo;enemy.&rdquo;</note>  It looks like it, he said.  What then are we to make of it, I asked, if neither the loving are to be friends, nor the loved, nor both the loving and loved together?<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">Socrates cannot be said to have disposed of this third proposition.</note>  For apart from these, are there any others left for us to cite as becoming friends to one another?  For my part, Socrates, he said, I declare I can see no sort of shift.
<milestone unit="section" n="213d"/>Can it be, Menexenus, I asked, that all through there has been something wrong with our inquiry?  I think there has, Socrates, said Lysis, and blushed as soon as he said it; for it struck me that the words escaped him unintentionally, through his closely applying his mind to our talk&mdash;as he had noticeably done all the time he was listening.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>So then, as I wanted to give Menexenus a rest, and was delighted with the other's taste for philosophy, I took occasion to shift the discussion over to Lysis, and said:
<milestone unit="section" n="213e"/>Lysis, I think your remark is true, that if we were inquiring correctly we could never have gone so sadly astray.  Well, let us follow our present line no further, since our inquiry looks to me a rather hard sort of path: I think we had best make for the point where we turned off,
<milestone unit="page" n="214"/><milestone unit="section" n="214a"/>and be guided by the poets; for they are our fathers, as it were, and conductors in wisdom.  They, of course, express themselves in no mean sort on the subject of friends, where they happen to be found; even saying that God himself makes them friends by drawing them to each other.  The way they put it, I believe, is something like this:<quote type="verse"><l met="dactylic">Yea, ever like and like together God doth draw,</l></quote><bibl n="Hom. Od. 17.218">Hom. Od.  17.218</bibl>
<milestone unit="section" n="214b"/> and so brings them acquainted; or have you not come across these verses?  Yes, I have, he replied.  And you have also come across those writings of eminent sages, which tell us this very thing&mdash;that like must needs be always friend to like?  I refer, of course, to those who debate or write about nature and the universe.<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">The attraction of like for like was an important force in the cosmology of Empedocles (c. <dateRange from="-475" to="-415">475</dateRange>-415 B.C.)</note>  Quite so, he said.  Well now, I went on, are they right in what they say?  Perhaps, he replied.  Perhaps in one half of it, I said; perhaps in even the whole; only we do not comprehend it.  We suppose that the nearer a wicked man
<milestone unit="section" n="214c"/>approaches to a wicked man, and the more he consorts with him, the more hateful he becomes; for he injures him, and we consider it impossible that injurer and injured should be friends.  Is it not so?  Yes, he answered.  On this showing, therefore, half of the saying cannot be true, if the wicked are like one another.  Quite so.  What I believe they mean is that the good are like one another, and are friends, while the bad&mdash;as is also said of them&mdash;are never like even their own selves,
<milestone unit="section" n="214d"/>being so ill-balanced and unsteady; and when a thing is unlike itself and variable it can hardly become like or friend to anything else.  You must surely agree to that?  I do, he said.  Hence I conclude there is a hidden meaning, dear friend, intended by those who say that like is friend to like, namely that the good alone is friend to the good alone, while the bad never enters into true friendship with either good or bad.  Do you agree?  He nodded assent.
<milestone unit="section" n="214e"/>So now we can tell what friends are; since our argument discloses that they are any persons who may be good.  I quite think so, said he.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And I also, said I; and yet there is a point in it that makes me uneasy:  so come, in Heaven's name, let us make out what it is that I suspect. like friend to like in so far as he is like, and is such an one useful to his fellow?  Let me put it another way: when anything whatever is like anything else, what benefit can it offer, or what harm can it do, to its like, which it could not offer or do to itself?  Or what could be done to it that could not be done to it by itself?
<milestone unit="page" n="215"/><milestone unit="section" n="215a"/>How can such things be cherished by each other, when they can bring no mutual succor?  Is it at all possible?  No.  And how can that be a friend, which is not cherished?  By no means.  But, granting that like is not friend to like, the good may still be friend to the good in so far as he is good, not as he is like?  Perhaps.  But again, will not the good, in so far as he is good, be in that measure sufficient for himself?  Yes.  And the sufficient has no need of anything,
<milestone unit="section" n="215b"/>by virtue of his sufficiency.<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">Socrates seems to pass unwarrantably from the limited to the unlimited meaning of &ldquo;sufficient.&rdquo;</note>  Of course.  And if a man has no need of anything he will not cherish anything.  Presumably not.  And that which does not cherish will not love.  I should think not.  And one who loves not is no friend.  Evidently.  So how can we say that the good will be friends to the good at all, when neither in absence do they long for one another&mdash;for they are sufficient for themselves even when apart&mdash;nor in presence have they need of one another?  How can it be contrived that such persons shall value each other highly?  By no means, he said.
<milestone unit="section" n="215c"/>And if they do not set a high value on each other, they cannot be friends.  True.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Now observe, Lysis, how we are missing the track.  Can it be, indeed, that we are deceived in the whole matter?  How so? he asked.  Once on a time I heard somebody say, and I have just recollected it, that like was most hostile to like, and so were good men to good men; and what is more, he put forward Hesiod as witness, by quoting his words&mdash;<quote type="verse"><l met="dactylic">See potter wroth with potter, bard with bard,</l></quote>
<milestone unit="section" n="215d"/><quote type="verse"><l met="dactylic">Beggar with beggar,</l></quote><bibl n="Hes. WD 25">Hes. WD 25</bibl>and in all other cases it was the same, he said; likest things must needs be filled with envy, contention, and hatred against each other, but the unlikest things with friendship: since the poor man must needs be friendly to the rich, and the weak to the strong, for the sake of assistance, and also the sick man to the doctor; and every ignorant person had to cherish the well-informed, and love him.  And then the speaker pursued his theme to this further and more imposing point&mdash;that like could not in the slightest degree be friendly to like,
<milestone unit="section" n="215e"/>but was in just the opposite case: for it was between things most opposed that friendship was chiefly to be found, since everything desired its opposite, not its like.  Thus dry desired wet, cold hot, bitter sweet, sharp blunt, empty fullness, full emptiness, and likewise the rest on the same principle: for the opposite was food for its opposite, as the like
<milestone unit="page" n="216"/><milestone unit="section" n="216a"/>could have no enjoyment of its like.  And I must say, my good friend, his argument seemed a smart one, for he expressed it well.  But you, I asked&mdash;how does it strike you?  It sounds all right, said Menexenus, at least on the moment's hearing.  Then are we to say that the opposite is most friendly to its opposite?  Certainly.  Well, I exclaimed, is it not monstrous, Menexenus?  Why, at once these all-accomplished logic-choppers will delightedly pounce on us and ask whether hatred is not the most opposite thing to friendship.
<milestone unit="section" n="216b"/>And what answer shall we give them?  Shall we not be forced to admit that what they say is true?  We shall.  So then, they will demand, is a hating thing friend to the friendly thing, or the friendly to the hating?  Neither, he replied.  But is the just a friend to the unjust, or the temperate to the profligate, or the good to the bad?  I do not think that could be so.  But yet, I urged, if one thing is friend to another on this principle of opposition, these things too must needs be friends.  They must.  So neither is like friend to like, nor opposite friend to opposite.  It seems not.
<milestone unit="section" n="216c"/> But there is still this point to consider; for perhaps we are yet more mistaken, and the friendly has really nothing to do with all this: it may rather be something neither good nor bad that will prove after all to be what we call friend of the good.  How do you mean?  he asked.  For the life of me, I said, I cannot tell: the fact is, I am quite dizzy myself with the puzzle of our argument, and am inclined to agree with the ancient proverb that the beautiful is friendly.<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">The proverb, of course, used <foreign lang="greek">FI/LON</foreign> in the sense of &ldquo;dear.&rdquo;</note>  It certainly resembles something soft and smooth and sleek;
<milestone unit="section" n="216d"/>that is why, I daresay, it so easily slides and dives right into us, by virtue of those qualities.  For I declare that the good is beautiful: do you not agree?  I do.  Then I will be a diviner for once, and state that what is neither good nor bad is friendly to what is beautiful and good; and what it is that prompts me to this divination, you must now hear.  My view is that there are three separate kinds, as it were&mdash;the good, the bad, and what is neither good nor bad; and what is yours?  Mine is the same, he replied.
<milestone unit="section" n="216e"/>And that neither is the good friendly to the good, nor the bad to the bad, nor the good to the bad; so much our previous argument already forbids.  One view then remains:  if anything is friendly to anything, that which is neither good nor bad is friendly to either the good or what is of the same quality as itself.  For I presume nothing could be found friendly to the bad.  True.  Nor, however, can like be friendly to like: this we stated just now, did we not?  Yes.  So what is neither good nor bad can have no friendship with the same sort of thing as itself.  Apparently not.  Then only what is neither good nor bad proves to be friendly to the good,
<milestone unit="page" n="217"/><milestone unit="section" n="217a"/>and to that only.  That must be so, it seems.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Then can we rely further on this present statement, my boys, I said, as a sure guide?  For instance, we have only to consider a body in health to see that it has no need of doctoring or assistance: it is well enough as it is, and so no one in health is friend to a doctor, on account of his health.  You agree?  Yes.  But the sick man is, I imagine, on account of his disease.  Certainly.  Now disease is a bad thing, and medicine is beneficial and good.  Yes.  And a body, of course, taken as body, is neither good nor bad.
<milestone unit="section" n="217b"/>That is so.  But a body is compelled by disease to welcome and love medicine.  I think so.  Thus what is neither bad nor good becomes a friend of the good because of the presence of evil.  So it seems.  But clearly this must be before it is itself made evil by the evil which it has; for surely, when once it has been made evil, it can no longer have any desire or love for the good; since we agreed it was impossible
<milestone unit="section" n="217c"/>for bad to be a friend of good.  Yes, impossible.  Now observe what I say.  Some things are of the same sort as those that are present with them, and some are not.  For example, if you chose to dye something a certain color, the substance of the dye is present, I presume, with the thing dyed.  Certainly.  Then is the thing dyed of the same sort, in point of color, as the substance that is added?  I do not understand, he said.
<milestone unit="section" n="217d"/>Well, try it this way, I went on: suppose some one tinged your golden locks with white lead, would they then be or appear to be white?  Yes, they would so appear, he replied.  And, in fact, whiteness would be present with them?  Yes.  But all the same they would not be any the more white as yet; for though whiteness be present, they are not at all white, any more than they are at all black.  True.  But when, my dear boy, old age has cast that same color upon them, they have then come to be of the same sort as
<milestone unit="section" n="217e"/>that which is present&mdash;white through presence of white.  To be sure.  So this is the question I have been trying to put to you&mdash;whether a thing that has something present with it is to be held of the same sort as that present thing or only when that thing is present in a particular way, but otherwise not?  More likely the latter, he said.  So that what is neither bad nor good is sometimes, when bad is present, not bad as yet, and such cases have been known to occur.  Certainly.  When therefore it is not bad as yet, though bad is present, this presence makes it desire good; but the presence which makes it bad deprives it equally of its desire and its love for the good.  For it is no longer
<milestone unit="page" n="218"/><milestone unit="section" n="218a"/>neither bad nor good, but bad; and we found that bad was no friend to good.  No, indeed.  And consequently we may say that those who are already wise no longer love wisdom, whether they be gods or men; nor again can those be lovers of wisdom who are in such ignorance as to be bad: for we know that a bad and stupid man is no lover of wisdom.  And now there remain those who, while possessing this bad thing, ignorance, are not yet made ignorant or stupid, but are still aware of not knowing the things
<milestone unit="section" n="218b"/>they do not know.  It follows, then, that those who are as yet neither good nor bad are lovers of wisdom, while all who are bad, and all the good, are not: for, as we found in our previous discussion, neither is opposite friend to opposite, nor like to like.  You remember, do you not?  To be sure we do, they both replied.  So now, Lysis and Menexenus, I said, we can count on having discovered what is the friendly and what is not.  For we say that, in the soul
<milestone unit="section" n="218c"/>and the body and everywhere, just that which is neither bad nor good, but has the presence of bad, is thereby friend of the good.  To this statement they said that they entirely agreed.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>And, beyond that, I was myself filled with delight, like a hunter, at the satisfaction of getting hold of what I was hunting; when somehow or other a most unaccountable suspicion came over me that the conclusion to which we had agreed was not true.  So at once I exclaimed in vexation: Alack-a-day, Lysis and Menexenus!  I fear our new-gotten riches are all a dream.
<milestone unit="section" n="218d"/> How on earth is that?  said Menexenus.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>I am afraid, I replied, that in our search for friendship we have struck up with arguments that are no better than a set of braggarts.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>How so ? he asked.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Just consider a moment, I said.  When a man is a friend, is he friend to some one or not?  He needs be, he replied.  Then is he so for the sake of nothing and because of nothing, or for the sake of something and because of something?  For the sake of something, and because of something.  Is it a friend&mdash;that thing for whose sake he is a friend to his friend&mdash;or is it neither friend nor foe?  I do not quite follow, he said.
<milestone unit="section" n="218e"/>Naturally enough, said I; but perhaps you will keep up if we try it another way, and I expect that I too will better understand what I am saying.  The sick man, we said just now, is a friend to the doctor; is not that so?  Yes.  Then is it because of disease, for the sake of health, that he is a friend of the doctor?  Yes.  And disease is a bad thing?  Of course.  But what is health? I asked: a good thing, or a bad, or neither?  A good thing, he said.
<milestone unit="page" n="219"/><milestone unit="section" n="219a"/>And we were saying, I believe, that the body, being neither good nor bad, was a friend of medicine&mdash;that is, of a good thing&mdash;because of disease&mdash;that is, because of a bad thing; and it is for the sake of health that medicine has acquired this friendship, and health is a good thing.  You agree?  Yes.  Is health a friend or not?  A friend.  And disease is a foe?  Certainly.  So what is neither bad nor good
<milestone unit="section" n="219b"/>is a friend to the good because of what is bad and a foe for the sake of what is good and a friend.  Apparently.  Hence the friend is a friend of its friend for the sake of its friend and because of its foe.  So it seems.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>Very well, I said: since we have reached this point, my boys, let us take good heed not to be deceived.  I pass over without remark the fact that the friend has become a friend to the friend, and thus the like becomes a friend to the like, which we said was impossible.  There is, however, a further point which we must examine,
<milestone unit="section" n="219c"/>if we are not to find our present argument a mere deception.  Medicine, we say, is a friend for the sake of health.  Yes.  Then is health a friend also?  Certainly.  And if it is a friend, it is so for the sake of something.  Yes.  And that something is a friend, if it is to conform to our previous agreement.  Quite so.  Then will that something be, on its part also, a friend for the sake of a friend?  Yes.  Now are we not bound to weary ourselves with going on in this way, unless we can arrive at some first principle which will not keep leading us on from one friend to another, but will reach the one original friend, for whose sake all the other things can be said
<milestone unit="section" n="219d"/>to be friends?  We must.  So you see what I am afraid of&mdash;that all the other things, which we cited as friends for the sake of that one thing, may be deceiving us like so many phantoms of it, while that original thing may be the veritable friend.  For suppose we view the matter thus: when a man highly values a thing, as in the common case of a father who prizes his son above all his possessions, will such a man, for the sake of placing his son before everything,
<milestone unit="section" n="219e"/>value anything else highly at the same time?  For instance, on learning that he had drunk some hemlock, would he value wine highly if he believed it would save his son's life?  Why, of course, he said.  And the vessel too which contained the wine?  Certainly.  Now does he make no distinction in value, at that moment, between a cup of earthenware and his own son, or between three pints of wine and his son?  Or may we perhaps state it thus: all such concern is not entertained for the actual things which are applied for the sake of something, but for that something for whose sake all the rest are applied?
<milestone unit="page" n="220"/><milestone unit="section" n="220a"/>I know that we often talk of setting great value on gold and silver: but surely we are no nearer the truth of the matter for that; what we rather value above everything is the thing&mdash;whatever it may prove to be&mdash;for whose sake gold and all the other commodities are applied.  May we state it so?  By all means.  Then shall we not give the same account of a friend?  In speaking of all the things that are friends to us
<milestone unit="section" n="220b"/>for the sake of some other friend, we find ourselves uttering a mere phrase; whereas in reality &ldquo;friend&rdquo; appears to be simply and solely the thing in which all these so-called friendships terminate.  So it appears, he said.  Then the real friend is a friend for the sake of nothing else that is a friend?  True.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>So we have got rid of this, and it is not for the sake of some friendly thing that the friend is friendly.  But now, is the good a friend?  I should say so.  And further, it is because of the bad that the good is loved<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">Socrates here strangely confuses the cause (<foreign lang="greek">TO\ DIA/ TI</foreign>) with the object in view (<foreign lang="greek">TO\ E(/NEKA/ TOU</foreign>), which he carefully distinguished in the case of medicine (219 A).</note>;
<milestone unit="section" n="220c"/>let me state the case as follows:  there are three things of which we have just been speaking&mdash;good, bad, and what is neither good nor bad.  If but two of these remained after evil had been cleared away, so that it had no contact with anything, whether body or soul or any of the other things that we count neither bad nor good in themselves, would the result be that good would be of no use to us, but would have become quite a useless thing?  For if there were nothing left to harm us, we should feel no want
<milestone unit="section" n="220d"/>of any assistance; and thus we should have to face the fact that it was because of the bad that we felt such a friendly affection for the good, since the good is a cure for the bad, while the bad is an ailment, and if there is no ailment there is no need for a cure.  Is not this the nature of the good&mdash;to be loved because of the bad by us who are midway between the bad and the good, whereas separately and for its own sake it is of no use?  Apparently so, he said.  Then our &ldquo;friend,&rdquo; in which
<milestone unit="section" n="220e"/>all the other things terminated&mdash;we called them &ldquo;friends for the sake of some other friend &rdquo;&mdash;has no resemblance to these.  For they are described as friends for the sake of a friend: but the real friend appears to have quite the opposite character; for we found if to be a friend for the sake of a foe, and if the foe should be removed we have no friend, it seems, any more.  I should say not, he assented, to judge by our present argument.  Tell me, I beg of you, I went on, if evil is abolished, will it be impossible any longer to feel hunger
<milestone unit="page" n="221"/><milestone unit="section" n="221a"/>or thirst or other such conditions?  Or will hunger exist, so long as men and animals exist, but without being hurtful?  Thirst, too, and all other desires&mdash;will these exist without being bad, because the bad will have been abolished?  Or is this a ridiculous question&mdash;as to what will exist or not exist in such a case?  For who can tell?  Yet this, at all events, we do know&mdash;that, as things are now, it is possible for a man to feel hunger as a hurt, and also to be benefited by it.  You agree?  Certainly.  And so, when a man feels thirst or any other desire of the sort,
<milestone unit="section" n="221b"/>he may have that desire sometimes with benefit, sometimes with harm, and sometimes with neither?  Quite so.  Now if evil things are abolished, is there any reason why the things that are not evil should be abolished along with the evil?  None.  So that those desires which are neither good nor bad will exist even when the bad things are abolished.  Apparently.  Now is it possible for a man, when he desires and loves, to have no friendly feeling towards that which he desires and loves?  I think not.  Thus certain things will continue to be friendly, it seems, when evil things are abolished.  Yes.
<milestone unit="section" n="221c"/>It cannot be that, if evil were the cause of a thing being friendly, one thing should be friendly to another when evil is abolished.  For when a cause is abolished, that thing can no longer exist, I presume, which had this as its cause.  You are right.  Now we have agreed that the friend has a friendly feeling for something and because of something; and we supposed, just then, that it was because of evil that what was neither good nor bad loved the good.
<milestone unit="section" n="221d"/>True.  But now, it seems, we make out a different cause of loving and being loved.  It seems so.  Can it really be then, as we were saying just now, that desire is the cause of friendship, and the desiring thing is a friend to what which it desires, and is so at any time of desiring; while our earlier statement about friends was all mere drivel, like a poem strung out for mere length?  It looks like it, he said.  But still, I went on, the desiring thing desires
<milestone unit="section" n="221e"/>that in which it is deficient, does it not?  Yes.  And the deficient is a friend to that in which it is deficient?  I suppose so.  And it becomes deficient in that of which it suffers a deprivation.  To be sure.  So it is one's own belongings,<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">i.e. things that are proper or congenial to one.</note> it seems, that are the objects of love and friendship and desire; so it appears, Menexenus and Lysis.  They both agreed.  Then if you two are friends to each other by some natural bond you belong to one another.  Precisely, they said.  And in a case where
<milestone unit="page" n="222"/><milestone unit="section" n="222a"/>one person desires another, my boys, or loves him, he would never be desiring or loving or befriending him, unless he somehow belonged to his beloved either in soul, or in some disposition, demeanor or cast of soul.  Yes, to be sure, said Menexenus; but Lysis was silent.  Very well, said I: what belongs to us by nature has been shown to be something we needs must befriend.  It seems so, he said.  Then the genuine, not the pretended, lover must needs be befriended by his favorite.
<milestone unit="section" n="222b"/>To this Lysis and Menexenus gave but a faint nod of assent; while Hippothales, in his delight, turned all manner of colors.<milestone unit="para" ed="P"/>So then, with the design of reviewing the argument, I proceeded: If there is any difference between what belongs and what is like, it seems to me, Lysis and Menexenus, that we might give some account of the meaning of &ldquo;friend.&rdquo;  But if &ldquo;like&rdquo; and &ldquo;belonging&rdquo; are the same, it is not easy to get rid of our former statement, that the like is useless to the like in so far as they have likeness; and to admit that the useless is friendly
<milestone unit="section" n="222c"/>would be a gross mistake.  So how if we agree now, I said, since our argument has made us quite tipsy, to say that the belonging and the like are two different things?  By all means.  Then shall we maintain that the good itself belongs to every one, while the bad is alien?  Or does the bad belong to the bad, the good to the good, and what is neither good nor bad to what is neither good nor bad?  They agreed that the last three pairs belong together.  So here again, boys,
<milestone unit="section" n="222d"/>I said, we have dropped into the very statements regarding friendship which we rejected at first; for now the unjust will be as much a friend of the unjust, and the bad of the bad, as the good of the good.<note anchored="yes" resp="Loeb">The word &ldquo;belonging&rdquo; seems to throw some light on &ldquo;friend,&rdquo; but even if we distinguish it from &ldquo;like&rdquo; it turns out to be just as indifferent to good and bad, and therefore just as remote from the moral significance of &ldquo;friend.&rdquo;</note>  So it seems, he said.  And what is more, if we say that the good and the belonging are the same, we cannot avoid making the good a friend only to the good.  To be sure.  But this again, you know, is a view of which we thought we had disabused ourselves; you remember, do you not?  We do.
<milestone unit="section" n="222e"/> So what more can we do with our argument?  Obviously, I think, nothing.  I can only ask you, accordingly, like the professional pleaders in the law courts, to perpend the whole of what has been said.  If neither the loved nor the loving, nor the like nor the unlike, nor the good nor the belonging, nor all the rest that we have tried in turn&mdash;they are so many that I, for one, fail to remember any more&mdash;well, if none of these is a friend, I am at a loss for anything further to say.
<milestone unit="page" n="223"/><milestone unit="section" n="223a"/> Having thus spoken, I was minded to stir up somebody else among the older people there; when, like spirits from another world, there came upon us the tutors of Menexenus and Lysis: they were bringing along the boys' brothers, and called out to them the order to go home; for it was getting late.  At first we tried, with the help of the group around us, to drive the tutors off; but they took no notice of us at all, and went on angrily calling, as before, in their foreign accent.  We decided that
<milestone unit="section" n="223b"/>they had taken a drop too much at the festival and might be awkward customers; so we gave in to them, and broke up our party.  However, just as they were moving off, I remarked: Today, Lysis and Menexenus, we have made ourselves ridiculous&mdash;I, an old man, as well as you.  For these others will go away and tell how we believe we are friends of one another&mdash;for I count myself in with you&mdash;but what a &ldquo;friend&rdquo; is, we have not yet succeeded in discovering.</p></body></text></group></text></TEI.2>
