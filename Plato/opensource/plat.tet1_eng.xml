<milestone unit="page" n="2"/><milestone n="2a" unit="section"/><sp><speaker>Euthyphro</speaker><p>What strange thing has happened, <placeName key="tgn,2674867">Socrates</placeName>, that you have left your accustomed haunts in the Lyceum and are now haunting the portico where the king archon sits?  For it cannot be that you have an action before the king, as I have.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Our Athenians, Euthyphro, do not call it an action, but an indictment.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Euthyphro</speaker><p>What?  Somebody has, it seems, brought an indictment against you;
<milestone n="2b" unit="section"/>for I don't accuse you of having brought one against anyone else.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Certainly not.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Euthyphro</speaker><p>But someone else against you?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Quite so.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Euthyphro</speaker><p>Who is he?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>I don't know the man very well myself, Euthyphro, for he seems to be a young and unknown person.  His name, however, is Meletus, I believe.  And he is of the deme of Pitthus, if you remember any Pitthian Meletus, with long hair and only a little beard, but with a hooked nose.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Euthyphro</speaker><p>I don't remember him, Socrates.  But
<milestone n="2c" unit="section"/>what sort of an indictment has he brought against you?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>What sort?  No mean one, it seems to me;  for the fact that, young as he is, he has apprehended so important a matter reflects no small credit upon him.  For he says he knows how the youth are corrupted and who those are who corrupt them.  He must be a wise man;  who, seeing my lack of wisdom and that I am corrupting his fellows, comes to the State, as a boy runs to his mother, to accuse me.  And he seems to me to be the only one of the public men who begins in the right way;  for the right way
<milestone n="2d" unit="section"/>is to take care of the young men first, to make them as good as possible, just as a good husbandman will naturally take care of the young plants first and afterwards of the rest.  And so Meletus, perhaps, is first
<milestone unit="page" n="3"/><milestone n="3a" unit="section"/>clearing away us who corrupt the young plants, as he says;  then after this, when he has turned his attention to the older men, he will bring countless most precious blessings upon the State,&mdash;at least, that is the natural outcome of the beginning he has made.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Euthyphro</speaker><p>I hope it may be so, Socrates;  but I fear the opposite may result.  For it seems to me that he begins by injuring the State at its very heart, when he undertakes to harm you.  Now tell me, what does he say you do that corrupts the young?
<milestone n="3b" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Absurd things, my friend, at first hearing.  For he says I am a maker of gods;  and because I make new gods and do not believe in the old ones, he indicted me for the sake of these old ones, as he says.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Euthyphro</speaker><p>I understand, Socrates;  it is because you say the divine monitor keeps coming to you.  So he has brought the indictment against you for making innovations in religion, and he is going into court to slander you, knowing that slanders on such subjects are readily accepted by the people.  Why, they even laugh at me and say I am crazy
<milestone n="3c" unit="section"/>when I say anything in the assembly about divine things and foretell the future to them.  And yet there is not one of the things I have foretold that is not true;  but they are jealous of all such men as you and I are.  However, we must not be disturbed, but must come to close quarters with them.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>My dear Euthyphro, their ridicule is perhaps of no consequence.  For the Athenians, I fancy, are not much concerned, if they think a man is clever, provided he does not impart his clever notions to others;  but when they think he makes others to be like himself,
<milestone n="3d" unit="section"/>they are angry with him, either through jealousy, as you say, or for some other reason.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Euthyphro</speaker><p>I don't much desire to test their sentiments toward me in this matter.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>No, for perhaps they think that you are reserved and unwilling to impart your wisdom.  But I fear that because of my love of men they think that I not only pour myself out copiously to anyone and everyone without payment, but that I would even pay something myself, if anyone would listen to me.  Now if, as I was saying just now, they were to laugh at me, as you say they do at you, it would not be at all unpleasant
<milestone n="3e" unit="section"/>to pass the time in the court with jests and laughter;  but if they are in earnest, then only soothsayers like you can tell how this will end.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Euthyphro</speaker><p>Well, Socrates, perhaps it won't amount to much, and you will bring your case to a satisfactory ending, as I think I shall mine.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>What is your case, Euthyphro? Are you defending or prosecuting?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Euthyphro</speaker><p>Prosecuting.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Whom?
<milestone unit="page" n="4"/><milestone n="4a" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Euthyphro</speaker><p>Such a man that they think I am insane because I am prosecuting<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">The Greek word has much the same meaning as the Latin &ldquo;prosequor,&rdquo; from which the English 'prosecute' is derived, 'follow,' 'pursue,' and is at the same time the technical term for 'prosecute.'</note> him.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Why?  Are you prosecuting one who has wings to fly away with?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Euthyphro</speaker><p>No flying for him at his ripe old age.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Who is he?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Euthyphro</speaker><p>My father.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Your father, my dear man?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Euthyphro</speaker><p>Certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>But what is the charge, and what is the suit about?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Euthyphro</speaker><p>Murder, Socrates.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Heracles!  Surely, Euthyphro, most people do not know where the right lies;  for I fancy it is not everyone who can rightly do what you are doing,
<milestone n="4b" unit="section"/>but only one who is already very far advanced in wisdom.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Euthyphro</speaker><p>Very far, indeed, Socrates, by Zeus.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Is the one who was killed by your father a relative?  But of course he was;  for you would not bring a charge of murder against him on a stranger's account.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Euthyphro</speaker><p>It is ridiculous, Socrates, that you think it matters whether the man who was killed was a stranger or a relative, and do not see that the only thing to consider is whether the action of the slayer was justified or not, and that if it was justified one ought to let him alone, and if not, one ought to proceed against him, even if he share one's hearth
<milestone n="4c" unit="section"/>and eat at one's table.  For the pollution is the same if you associate knowingly with such a man and do not purify yourself and him by proceeding against him.  In this case, the man who was killed was a hired workman of mine, and when we were farming at <placeName key="tgn,7003909">Naxos</placeName>, he was working there on our land.  Now he got drunk, got angry with one of our house slaves, and butchered him.  So my father bound him hand and foot, threw him into a ditch, and sent a man here to <placeName key="tgn,7001393">Athens</placeName> to ask the religious adviser what he ought
<milestone n="4d" unit="section"/>to do.  In the meantime he paid no attention to the man as he lay there bound, and neglected him, thinking that he was a murderer and it did not matter if he were to die.  And that is just what happened to him.  For he died of hunger and cold and his bonds before the messenger came back from the adviser.  Now my father and the rest of my relatives are angry with me, because for the sake of this murderer I am prosecuting my father for murder.  For they say he did not kill him, and if he had killed him never so much, yet since the dead man was a murderer, I ought not to trouble myself about such a fellow,
<milestone n="4e" unit="section"/>because it is unholy for a son to prosecute his father for murder.  Which shows how little they know what the divine law is in regard to holiness and unholiness.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>But, in the name of Zeus, Euthyphro, do you think your knowledge about divine laws and holiness and unholiness is so exact that, when the facts are as you say, you are not afraid of doing something unholy yourself in prosecuting your father for murder?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Euthyphro</speaker><p>I should be of no use, Socrates,
<milestone unit="page" n="5"/><milestone n="5a" unit="section"/>and Euthyphro would be in no way different from other men, if I did not have exact knowledge about all such things.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then the best thing for me, my admirable Euthyphro, is to become your pupil and, before the suit with Meletus comes on, to challenge him and say that I always thought it very important before to know about divine matters and that now, since he says I am doing wrong by acting carelessly and making innovations in matters of religion, I have become your pupil.  And &ldquo;Meletus,&rdquo; I should say,
<milestone n="5b" unit="section"/>&ldquo;if you acknowledge that Euthyphro is wise in such matters, then believe that I also hold correct opinions, and do not bring me to trial;  and if you do not acknowledge that, then bring a suit against him, my teacher, rather than against me, and charge him with corrupting the old, namely, his father and me, which he does by teaching me and by correcting and punishing his father.&rdquo;  And if he does not do as I ask and does not release me from the indictment or bring it against you in my stead, I could say in the court the same things I said in my challenge to him, could I not?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Euthyphro</speaker><p>By Zeus, Socrates, if he should undertake to indict me,
<milestone n="5c" unit="section"/>I fancy I should find his weak spot, and it would be much more a question about him in court than about me.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And I, my dear friend, perceiving this, wish to become your pupil;  for I know that neither this fellow Meletus, nor anyone else, seems to notice you at all, but he has seen through me so sharply and so easily that he has indicted me for impiety.  Now in the name of Zeus, tell me what you just now asserted that you knew so well.  What do you say is the nature of piety and impiety, both
<milestone n="5d" unit="section"/>in relation to murder and to other things?  Is not holiness always the same with itself in every action and, on the other hand, is not unholiness the opposite of all holiness, always the same with itself and whatever is to be unholy possessing some one characteristic quality?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Euthyphro</speaker><p>Certainly, Socrates.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Tell me then, what do you say holiness is, and what unholiness?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Euthyphro</speaker><p>Well then, I say that holiness is doing what I am doing now, prosecuting the wrongdoer who commits murder or steals from the temples or does any such thing, whether he be your father,
<milestone n="5e" unit="section"/>or your mother or anyone else, and not prosecuting him is unholy.  And, Socrates, see what a sure proof I offer you,&mdash;a proof I have already given to others,&mdash;that this is established and right and that we ought not to let him who acts impiously go unpunished, no matter who he may be.  Men believe
<milestone unit="page" n="6"/><milestone n="6a" unit="section"/>that Zeus is the best and most just of the gods, and they acknowledge that he put his father in bonds because he wickedly devoured his children, and he in turn had mutilated his father for similar reasons;  but they are incensed against me because I proceed against my father when he has done wrong, and so they are inconsistent in what they say about the gods and about me.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Is not this, Euthyphro, the reason why I am being prosecuted, because when people tell such stories about the gods I find it hard to accept them?  And therefore, probably, people will say I am wrong.  Now if you, who know so much about such things,
<milestone n="6b" unit="section"/>accept these tales, I suppose I too must give way.  For what am I to say, who confess frankly that I know nothing about them?  But tell me, in the name of Zeus, the god of friendship, do you really believe these things happened?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Euthyphro</speaker><p>Yes, and still more wonderful things than these, Socrates, which most people do not know.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And so you believe that there was really war between the gods, and fearful enmities and battles and other things of the sort, such as are told of by the poets and represented in varied designs
<milestone n="6c" unit="section"/>by the great artists in our sacred places and especially on the robe which is carried up to the Acropolis at the great Panathenaea?  for this is covered with such representations.  Shall we agree that these things are true, Euthyphro?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Euthyphro</speaker><p>Not only these things, Socrates;  but, as I said just now, I will, if you like, tell you many other things about the gods, which I am sure will amaze you when you hear them.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>I dare say.  But you can tell me those things at your leisure some other time.  At present try to tell more clearly what I asked you just now.
<milestone n="6d" unit="section"/>For, my friend, you did not give me sufficient information before, when I asked what holiness was, but you told me that this was holy which you are now doing, prosecuting your father for murder.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Euthyphro</speaker><p>Well, what I said was true, Socrates.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Perhaps.  But, Euthyphro, you say that many other things are holy, do you not?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Euthyphro</speaker><p>Why, so they are.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Now call to mind that this is not what I asked you, to tell me one or two of the many holy acts, but to tell the essential aspect, by which all holy acts are holy;  for you said
<milestone n="6e" unit="section"/>that all unholy acts were unholy and all holy ones holy by one aspect.  Or don't you remember?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Euthyphro</speaker><p>I remember.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Tell me then what this aspect is, that I may keep my eye fixed upon it and employ it as a model and, if anything you or anyone else does agrees with it, may say that the act is holy, and if not, that it is unholy.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Euthyphro</speaker><p>If you wish me to explain in that way, I will do so.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>I do wish it.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Euthyphro</speaker><p>Well then, what is dear to the gods is holy,
<milestone unit="page" n="7"/><milestone n="7a" unit="section"/>and what is not dear to them is unholy.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Excellent, Euthyphro, now you have answered as I asked you to answer.  However, whether it is true, I am not yet sure;  but you will, of course, show that what you say is true.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Euthyphro</speaker><p>Certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Come then, let us examine our words.  The thing and the person that are dear to the gods are holy, and the thing and the person that are hateful to the gods are unholy;  and the two are not the same, but the holy and the unholy are the exact opposites of each other.  Is not this what we have said?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Euthyphro</speaker><p>Yes, just this.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And it seems to be correct?
<milestone n="7b" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Euthyphro</speaker><p>I think so, Socrates.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Well then, have we said this also, that the gods, Euthyphro, quarrel and disagree with each other, and that there is enmity between them?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Euthyphro</speaker><p>Yes, we have said that.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>But what things is the disagreement about, which causes enmity and anger?  Let us look at it in this way.  If you and I were to disagree about number, for instance, which of two numbers were the greater, would the disagreement about these matters make us enemies and make us angry with each other, or should we not quickly settle it by resorting
<milestone n="7c" unit="section"/>to arithmetic?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Euthyphro</speaker><p>Of course we should.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then, too, if we were to disagree about the relative size of things, we should quickly put an end to the disagreement by measuring?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Euthyphro</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And we should, I suppose, come to terms about relative weights by weighing?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Euthyphro</speaker><p>Of course.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>But about what would a disagreement be, which we could not settle and which would cause us to be enemies and be angry with each other?  Perhaps you cannot give an answer offhand;
<milestone n="7d" unit="section"/>but let me suggest it.  Is it not about right and wrong, and noble and disgraceful, and good and bad?  Are not these the questions about which you and I and other people become enemies, when we do become enemies, because we differ about them and cannot reach any satisfactory agreement?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Euthyphro</speaker><p>Yes, Socrates, these are the questions about which we should become enemies.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And how about the gods,</p></sp><sp><speaker>Euthyphro</speaker><p>If they disagree, would they not disagree about these questions?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Euthyphro</speaker><p>Necessarily.
<milestone n="7e" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then, my noble Euthyphro, according to what you say, some of the gods too think some things are right or wrong and noble or disgraceful, and good or bad, and others disagree;  for they would not quarrel with each other if they did not disagree about these matters.  Is that the case?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Euthyphro</speaker><p>You are right.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then the gods in each group love the things which they consider good and right and hate the opposites of these things?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Euthyphro</speaker><p>Certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>But you say that the same things are considered right by some of them and wrong by others;  and it is because they disagree about these things
<milestone unit="page" n="8"/><milestone n="8a" unit="section"/>that they quarrel and wage war with each other.  Is not this what you said?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Euthyphro</speaker><p>It is.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then, as it seems, the same things are hated and loved by the gods, and the same things would be dear and hateful to the gods.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Euthyphro</speaker><p>So it seems.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And then the same things would be both holy and unholy, Euthyphro, according to this statement.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Euthyphro</speaker><p>I suppose so.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then you did not answer my question, my friend.  For I did not ask you what is at once holy and unholy;  but, judging from your reply, what is dear to the gods is also hateful to the gods.  And so, Euthyphro,
<milestone n="8b" unit="section"/>it would not be surprising if, in punishing your father as you are doing, you were performing an act that is pleasing to Zeus, but hateful to Cronus and Uranus, and pleasing to Hephaestus, but hateful to Hera, and so forth in respect to the other gods, if any disagree with any other about it.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Euthyphro</speaker><p>But I think, Socrates, that none of the gods disagrees with any other about this, or holds that he who kills anyone wrongfully ought not to pay the penalty.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Well, Euthyphro, to return to men, did you ever hear anybody arguing that he who had killed anyone wrongfully,
<milestone n="8c" unit="section"/>or had done anything else whatever wrongfully, ought not to pay the penalty?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Euthyphro</speaker><p>Why, they are always arguing these points, especially in the law courts.  For they do very many wrong things;  and then there is nothing they will not do or say, in defending themselves, to avoid the penalty.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Yes, but do they acknowledge, Euthyphro, that they have done wrong and, although they acknowledge it, nevertheless say that they ought not to pay the penalty?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Euthyphro</speaker><p>Oh, no, they don't do that.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then there is something they do not do and say.  For they do not, I fancy, dare to say and argue that,
<milestone n="8d" unit="section"/>if they have really done wrong, they ought not to pay the penalty;  but, I think, they say they have not done wrong;  do they not?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Euthyphro</speaker><p>You are right.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then they do not argue this point, that the wrongdoer must not pay the penalty;  but perhaps they argue about this, who is a wrongdoer, and what he did, and when.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Euthyphro</speaker><p>That is true.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then is not the same thing true of the gods, if they quarrel about right and wrong, as you say, and some say others have done wrong, and some say they have not?  For surely, my friend, no one, either of gods or men,
<milestone n="8e" unit="section"/>has the face to say that he who does wrong ought not to pay the penalty.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Euthyphro</speaker><p>Yes, you are right about this, Socrates, in the main.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>But I think, Euthyphro, those who dispute, both men and gods, if the gods do dispute, dispute about each separate act.  When they differ with one another about any act, some say it was right and others that it was wrong.  Is it not so?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Euthyphro</speaker><p>Certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Come now, my dear Euthyphro,
<milestone unit="page" n="9"/><milestone n="9a" unit="section"/>inform me, that I may be made wiser, what proof you have that all the gods think that the man lost his life wrongfully, who, when he was a servant, committed murder, was bound by the master of the man he killed, and died as a result of his bonds before the master who had bound him found out from the advisers what he ought to do with him, and that it is right on account of such a man for a son to proceed against his father and accuse him of murder.  Come, try to show me clearly about this, that
<milestone n="9b" unit="section"/>the gods surely believe that this conduct is right;  and if you show it to my satisfaction, I will glorify your wisdom as long as I live.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Euthyphro</speaker><p>But perhaps this is no small task, Socrates;  though I could show you quite clearly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>I understand;  it is because you think I am slower to understand than the judges;  since it is plain that you will show them that such acts are wrong and that all the gods hate them.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Euthyphro</speaker><p>Quite clearly, Socrates;  that is, if they listen to me.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>They will listen, if they find that you are a good speaker.
<milestone n="9c" unit="section"/>But this occurred to me while you were talking, and I said to myself:  &ldquo;If Euthyphro should prove to me no matter how clearly that all the gods think such a death is wrongful, what have I learned from Euthyphro about the question, what is holiness and what is unholiness?  For this act would, as it seems, be hateful to the gods;  but we saw just now that holiness and its opposite are not defined in this way;  for we saw that what is hateful to the gods is also dear to them;  and so I let you off any discussion of this point,</p></sp><sp><speaker>Euthyphro</speaker><p>If you like, all the gods
<milestone n="9d" unit="section"/>may think it wrong and may hate it.  But shall we now emend our definition and say that whatever all the gods hate is unholy and whatever they all love is holy, and what some love and others hate is neither or both?  Do you wish this now to be our definition of holiness and unholiness?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Euthyphro</speaker><p>What is to hinder, Socrates?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Nothing, so far as I am concerned, Euthyphro, but consider your own position, whether by adopting this definition you will most easily teach me what you promised.
<milestone n="9e" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Euthyphro</speaker><p>Well, I should say that what all the gods love is holy and, on the other hand, what they all hate is unholy.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then shall we examine this again, Euthyphro, to see if it is correct, or shall we let it go and accept our own statement, and those of others, agreeing that it is so, if anyone merely says that it is?  Or ought we to inquire into the correctness of the statement?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Euthyphro</speaker><p>We ought to inquire.  However, I think this is now correct.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>We shall soon know more about this, my friend.
<milestone unit="page" n="10"/><milestone n="10a" unit="section"/>Just consider this question:&mdash;Is that which is holy loved by the gods because it is holy, or is it holy because it is loved by the gods?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Euthyphro</speaker><p>I don't know what you mean, Socrates.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then I will try to speak more clearly.  We speak of being carried and of carrying, of being led and of leading, of being seen and of seeing;  and you understand&mdash;do you not?&mdash;that in all such expressions the two parts differ one from the other in meaning, and how they differ.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Euthyphro</speaker><p>I think I understand.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then, too, we conceive of a thing being loved and of a thing loving, and the two are different?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Euthyphro</speaker><p>Of course.
<milestone n="10b" unit="section"/> Socrates.  Now tell me, is a thing which is carried a carried thing because one carries it, or for some other reason?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Euthyphro</speaker><p>No, for that reason.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And a thing which is led is led because one leads it, and a thing which is seen is so because one sees it?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Euthyphro</speaker><p>Certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then one does not see it because its a seen thing, but, on the contrary, it is a seen thing because one sees it;  and one does not lead it because it is a led thing, but it is a led thing because one leads it;  and one does not carry it because it is a carried thing, but it is a carried thing because one carries it.  Is it clear, Euthyphro,
<milestone n="10c" unit="section"/>what I am trying to say?  I am trying to say this, that if anything becomes or undergoes, it does not become because it is in a state of becoming, but it is in a state of becoming because it becomes, and it does not undergo because it is a thing which undergoes, but because it undergoes it is a thing which undergoes;  or do you not agree to this?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Euthyphro</speaker><p>I agree.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Is not that which is beloved a thing which is either becoming or undergoing something?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Euthyphro</speaker><p>Certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And is this case like the former ones:  those who love it do not love it because it is a bad thing, but it is a beloved thing because they love it?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Euthyphro</speaker><p>Obviously.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Now what do you say about that which is holy,
<milestone n="10d" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Euthyphro</speaker><p>It is loved by all the gods, is it not, according to what you said?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Euthyphro</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>For this reason, because it is holy, or for some other reason?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Euthyphro</speaker><p>No, for this reason.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>It is loved because it is holy, not holy because it is loved?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Euthyphro</speaker><p>I think so.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>But that which is dear to the gods is dear to them and beloved by them because they love it.
<milestone n="10e" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Euthyphro</speaker><p>Of course.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then that which is dear to the gods and that which is holy are not identical, but differ one from the other.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Euthyphro</speaker><p>How so, Socrates?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Because we are agreed that the holy is loved because it is holy and that it is not holy because it is loved;  are we not?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Euthyphro</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>But we are agreed that what is dear to the gods is dear to them because they love it, that is, by reason of this love, not that they love it because it is dear.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Euthyphro</speaker><p>Very true.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>But if that which is dear to the gods and that which is holy were identical, my dear Euthyphro, then if the holy
<milestone unit="page" n="11"/><milestone n="11a" unit="section"/>were loved because it is holy, that which is dear to the gods would be loved because it is dear, and if that which is dear to the gods is dear because it is loved, then that which is holy would be holy because it is loved;  but now you see that the opposite is the case, showing that the two are different from each other.  For the one becomes lovable from the fact that it is loved, whereas the other is loved because it is in itself lovable.  And, Euthyphro, it seems that when you were asked what holiness is you were unwilling to make plain its essence, but you mentioned something that has happened to this holiness, namely,
<milestone n="11b" unit="section"/>that it is loved by the gods.  But you did not tell as yet what it really is.  So, if you please, do not hide it from me, but begin over again and tell me what holiness is, no matter whether it is loved by the gods or anything else happens it;  for we shall not quarrel about that.  But tell me frankly, What is holiness, and what is unholiness?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Euthyphro</speaker><p>But, Socrates, I do not know how to say what I mean.  For whatever statement we advance, somehow or other it moves about and won't stay where we put it.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Your statements, Euthyphro,
<milestone n="11c" unit="section"/>are like works of my<note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes">Socrates was the son of a sculptor and was himself educated to be a sculptor.  This is doubtless the reason for his reference to Daedalus as an ancestor.  Daedalus was a half mythical personage whose statues were said to have been so lifelike that they moved their eyes and walked about.</note> ancestor Daedalus, and if I were the one who made or advanced them, you might laugh at me and say that on account of my relationship to him my works in words run away and won't stay where they are put.  But now&mdash;well, the statements are yours;  so some other jest is demanded;  for they stay fixed, as you yourself see.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Euthyphro</speaker><p>I think the jest does very well as it is;
<milestone n="11d" unit="section"/>for I am not the one who makes these statements move about and not stay in the same place, but you are the Daedalus;  for they would have stayed, so far as I am concerned.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Apparently then, my friend, I am a more clever artist than Daedalus, inasmuch as he made only his own works move, whereas I, as it seems, give motion to the works of others as well as to my own.
<milestone n="11e" unit="section"/>And the most exquisite thing about my art is that I am clever against my will;  for I would rather have my words stay fixed and stable than possess the wisdom of Daedalus and the wealth of Tantalus besides.  But enough of this.  Since you seem to be indolent, I will aid you myself, so that you may instruct me about holiness.  And do not give it up beforehand.  Just see whether you do not think that everything that is holy is right.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Euthyphro</speaker><p>I do.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>But is everything that is right also holy?
<milestone unit="page" n="12"/><milestone n="12a" unit="section"/>Or is all which is holy right, and not all which is right holy, but part of it holy and part something else?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Euthyphro</speaker><p>I can't follow you, Socrates.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And yet you are as much younger than I as you are wiser;  but, as I said, you are indolent on account of your wealth of wisdom.  But exert yourself, my friend;  for it is not hard to understand what I mean.  What I mean is the opposite of what the poet said, who wrote:<quote type="verse"><l met="dactylic">Zeus the creator, him who made all things,</l></quote>
<milestone n="12b" unit="section"/><cit><quote type="verse">thou wilt not name;  for where fear is, there also is reverence.</quote><bibl>Stasinus, author of the <title>Cypria</title> (Fragm. 20, ed. Kinkel)</bibl></cit> Now I disagree with the poet.  Shall I tell you how?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Euthyphro</speaker><p>By all means.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>It does not seem to me true that where fear is, there also is reverence;  for many who fear diseases and poverty and other such things seem to me to fear, but not to reverence at all these things which they fear.  Don't you think so, too?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Euthyphro</speaker><p>Certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>But I think that where reverence is, there also is fear;  for does not everyone who has a feeling of reverence and shame about any act
<milestone n="12c" unit="section"/>also dread and fear the reputation for wickedness?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Euthyphro</speaker><p>Yes, he does fear.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then it is not correct to say &ldquo;where fear is, there also is reverence.&rdquo;  On the contrary, where reverence is, there also is fear;  but reverence is not everywhere where fear is, since, as I think, fear is more comprehensive than reverence;  for reverence is a part of fear, just as the odd is a part of number, so that it is not true that where number is, there also is the odd, but that where the odd is, there also is number.  Perhaps you follow me now?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Euthyphro</speaker><p>Perfectly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>It was something of this sort that I meant before, when I asked whether where the right is, there also is holiness, or where holiness is,
<milestone n="12d" unit="section"/>there also is the right;  but holiness is not everywhere where the right is, for holiness is a part of the right.  Do we agree to this, or do you dissent?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Euthyphro</speaker><p>No, I agree;  for I think the statement is correct.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Now observe the next point.  If holiness is a part of the right, we must, apparently, find out what part of the right holiness is.  Now if you asked me about one of the things I just mentioned, as, for example, what part of number the even was, and what kind of a number it was I should say, &ldquo;that which is not indivisible by two, but divisible by two&rdquo;;  or don't you agree?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Euthyphro</speaker><p>I agree.
<milestone n="12e" unit="section"/> Socrates.  Now try in your turn to teach me what part of the right holiness is, that I may tell Meletus not to wrong me any more or bring suits against me for impiety, since I have now been duly instructed by you about what is, and what is not, pious and holy.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Euthyphro</speaker><p>This then is my opinion, Socrates, that the part of the right which has to do with attention to the gods constitutes piety and holiness, and that the remaining part of the right is that which has to do with the service of men.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>I think you are correct, Euthyphro;
<milestone unit="page" n="13"/><milestone n="13a" unit="section"/>but there is one little point about which I still want information, for I do not yet understand what you mean by &ldquo;attention.&rdquo;  I don't suppose you mean the same kind of attention to the gods which is paid to other things.  We say, for example, that not everyone knows how to attend to horses, but only he who is skilled in horsemanship, do we not?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Euthyphro</speaker><p>Certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then horsemanship is the art of attending to horses?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Euthyphro</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And not everyone knows how to attend to dogs, but only the huntsman?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Euthyphro</speaker><p>That is so.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then the huntsman's art is the art of attending to dogs?
<milestone n="13b" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Euthyphro</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And the oxherd's art is that of attending to oxen?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Euthyphro</speaker><p>Certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And holiness and piety is the art of attending to the gods?  Is that what you mean, Euthyphro?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Euthyphro</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Now does attention always aim to accomplish the same end?  I mean something like this:  It aims at some good or benefit to the one to whom it is given, as you see that horses, when attended to by the horseman's art are benefited and made better;  or don't you think so?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Euthyphro</speaker><p>Yes, I do.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And dogs are benefited by the huntsman's art
<milestone n="13c" unit="section"/>and oxen by the oxherd's and everything else in the same way?  Or do you think care and attention are ever meant for the injury of that which is cared for?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Euthyphro</speaker><p>No, by Zeus, I do not.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>But for its benefit?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Euthyphro</speaker><p>Of course.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then holiness, since it is the art of attending to the gods, is a benefit to the gods, and makes them better?  And you would agree that when you do a holy or pious act you are making one of the gods better?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Euthyphro</speaker><p>No, by Zeus, not I.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Nor do I, Euthyphro, think that is what you meant.  Far from it.  But I asked what you meant by
<milestone n="13d" unit="section"/>&ldquo;attention to the gods&rdquo; just because I did not think you meant anything like that.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Euthyphro</speaker><p>You are right, Socrates;  that is not what I mean.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Well, what kind of attention to the gods is holiness?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Euthyphro</speaker><p>The kind, Socrates, that servants pay to their masters.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>I understand.  It is, you mean, a kind of service to the gods?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Euthyphro</speaker><p>Exactly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Now can you tell me what result the art that serves the physician serves to produce?  Is it not health?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Euthyphro</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Well then;  what is it which the art
<milestone n="13e" unit="section"/>that serves shipbuilders serves to produce?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Euthyphro</speaker><p>Evidently, Socrates, a ship.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And that which serves housebuilders serves to build a house?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Euthyphro</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then tell me, my friend;  what would the art which serves the gods serve to accomplish?  For it is evident that you know, since you say you know more than any other man about matters which have to do with the gods.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Euthyphro</speaker><p>And what I say is true, Socrates.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then, in the name of Zeus, tell me, what is that glorious result which the gods accomplish by using us as servants?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Euthyphro</speaker><p>They accomplish many fine results, Socrates.
<milestone unit="page" n="14"/><milestone n="14a" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Yes, and so do generals, my friend;  but nevertheless, you could easily tell the chief of them, namely, that they bring about victory in war.  Is that not the case?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Euthyphro</speaker><p>Of course.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And farmers also, I think, accomplish many fine results;  but still the chief result of their work is food from the land?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Euthyphro</speaker><p>Certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>But how about the many fine results the gods accomplish?  What is the chief result of their work?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Euthyphro</speaker><p>I told you a while ago, Socrates,
<milestone n="14b" unit="section"/>that it is a long task to learn accurately all about these things.  However, I say simply that when one knows how to say and do what is gratifying to the gods, in praying and sacrificing, that is holiness, and such things bring salvation to individual families and to states;  and the opposite of what is gratifying to the gods is impious, and that overturns and destroys everything.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>You might, if you wished, Euthyphro, have answered much more briefly the chief part of my question.  But it is plain that you do not care to instruct me.
<milestone n="14c" unit="section"/>For now, when you were close upon it you turned aside;  and if you had answered it, I should already have obtained from you all the instruction I need about holiness.  But, as things are, the questioner must follow the one questioned wherever he leads.  What do you say the holy, or holiness, is?  Do you not say that it is a kind of science of sacrificing and praying?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Euthyphro</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And sacrificing is making gifts to the gods
<milestone n="14d" unit="section"/>and praying is asking from them?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Euthyphro</speaker><p>Exactly, Socrates.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then holiness, according to this definition, would be a science of giving and asking.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Euthyphro</speaker><p>You understand perfectly what I said, Socrates.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Yes, my friend, for I am eager for your wisdom, and give my mind to it, so that nothing you say shall fall to the ground.  But tell me, what is this service of the gods?  Do you say that it consists in asking from them and giving to them?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Euthyphro</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Would not the right way of asking be to ask of them what we need from them?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Euthyphro</speaker><p>What else?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And the right way of giving, to present them with
<milestone n="14e" unit="section"/>what they need from us?  For it would not be scientific giving to give anyone what he does not need.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Euthyphro</speaker><p>You are right, Socrates.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then holiness would be an art of barter between gods and men?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Euthyphro</speaker><p>Yes, of barter, if you like to call it so.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>I don't like to call it so, if it is not true.  But tell me, what advantage accrues to the gods from the gifts they get from us?  For everybody knows what they give,
<milestone unit="page" n="15"/><milestone n="15a" unit="section"/>since we have nothing good which they do not give.  But what advantage do they derive from what they get from us?  Or have we so much the better of them in our bartering that we get all good things from them and they nothing from us?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Euthyphro</speaker><p>Why you don't suppose, Socrates, that the gods gain any advantage from what they get from us, do you?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Well then, what would those gifts of ours to the gods be?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Euthyphro</speaker><p>What else than honor and praise, and, as I said before, gratitude?
<milestone n="15b" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then, Euthyphro, holiness is grateful to the gods, but not advantageous or precious to the gods?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Euthyphro</speaker><p>I think it is precious, above all things.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then again, it seems, holiness is that which is precious to the gods.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Euthyphro</speaker><p>Certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then will you be surprised, since you say this, if your words do not remain fixed but walk about, and will you accuse me of being the Daedalus who makes them walk, when you are yourself much more skilful than Daedalus and make them go round in a circle?  Or do you not see
<milestone n="15c" unit="section"/>that our definition has come round to the point from which it started?  For you remember, I suppose, that a while ago we found that holiness and what is dear to the gods were not the same, but different from each other;  or do you not remember?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Euthyphro</speaker><p>Yes, I remember.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then don't you see that now you say that what is precious to the gods is holy?  And is not this what is dear to the gods?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Euthyphro</speaker><p>Certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then either our agreement a while ago was wrong, or if that was right, we are wrong now.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Euthyphro</speaker><p>So it seems.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then we must begin again at the beginning and ask what holiness is.  Since I shall not willingly give up until I learn.
<milestone n="15d" unit="section"/>And do not scorn me, but by all means apply your mind now to the utmost and tell me the truth;  for you know, if anyone does, and like Proteus, you must be held until you speak.  For if you had not clear knowledge of holiness and unholiness, you would surely not have undertaken to prosecute your aged father for murder for the sake of a servant.  You would have been afraid to risk the anger of the gods, in case your conduct should be wrong, and would have been ashamed in the sight of men.  But now I am sure
<milestone n="15e" unit="section"/>you think you know what is holy and what is not.  So tell me, most excellent Euthyphro, and do not conceal your thought.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Euthyphro</speaker><p>Some other time, Socrates.  Now I am in a hurry and it is time for me to go.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Oh my friend, what are you doing?  You go away and leave me cast down from the high hope I had that I should learn from you what is holy, and what is not, and should get rid of Meletus's indictment by showing him
<milestone unit="page" n="16"/><milestone n="16a" unit="section"/>that I have been made wise by Euthyphro about divine matters and am no longer through ignorance acting carelessly and making innovations in respect to them, and that I shall live a better life henceforth.</p></sp></body></text>

But I was most amazed by one of the many lies that they told&mdash;when they said that you must be on your guard not to be deceived by me,
<milestone n="17b" unit="section"/>because I was a clever speaker.  For I thought it the most shameless part of their conduct that they are not ashamed because they will immediately be convicted by me of falsehood by the evidence of fact, when I show myself to be not in the least a clever speaker, unless indeed they call him a clever speaker who speaks the truth;  for if this is what they mean, I would agree that I am an orator&mdash;not after their fashion.  Now they, as I say, have said little or nothing true;  but you shall hear from me nothing but the truth.  Not, however, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, speeches finely tricked out with words and phrases,
<milestone n="17c" unit="section"/>as theirs are, nor carefully arranged, but you will hear things said at random with the words that happen to occur to me.  For I trust that what I say is just;  and let none of you expect anything else.  For surely it would not be fitting for one of my age to come before you like a youngster making up speeches.  And, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, I urgently beg and beseech you if you hear me making my defence with the same words with which I have been accustomed to speak both in the market place at the bankers tables, where many of you have heard me, and elsewhere,
<milestone n="17d" unit="section"/>not to be surprised or to make a disturbance on this account.  For the fact is that this is the first time I have come before the court, although I am seventy years old;  I am therefore an utter foreigner to the manner of speech here.  Hence, just as you would, of course, if I were really a foreigner, pardon me if I spoke in that dialect and that manner
<milestone unit="page" n="18"/><milestone n="18a" unit="section"/>in which I had been brought up, so now I make this request of you, a fair one, as it seems to me, that you disregard the manner of my speech&mdash;for perhaps it might be worse and perhaps better&mdash;and observe and pay attention merely to this, whether what I say is just or not;  for that is the virtue of a judge, and an orator's virtue is to speak the truth.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>First then it is right for me to defend myself against the first false accusations brought against me, and the first accusers, and then against the later accusations and the later accusers. 
<milestone n="18b" unit="section"/>For many accusers have risen up against me before you, who have been speaking for a long time, many years already, and saying nothing true;  and I fear them more than Anytus and the rest, though these also are dangerous;  but those others are more dangerous, gentlemen, who gained your belief, since they got hold of most of you in childhood, and accused me without any truth, saying, &ldquo;There is a certain Socrates, a wise man, a ponderer over the things in the air and one who has investigated the things beneath the earth and who makes the weaker argument the stronger.&rdquo;  These, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>,
<milestone n="18c" unit="section"/>who have spread abroad this report, are my dangerous enemies.  For those who hear them think that men who investigate these matters do not even believe in gods.  Besides, these accusers are many and have been making their accusations already for a long time, and moreover they spoke to you at an age at which you would believe them most readily (some of you in youth, most of you in childhood), and the case they prosecuted went utterly by default, since nobody appeared in defence.  But the most unreasonable thing of all is this, that it is not even possible
<milestone n="18d" unit="section"/>to know and speak their names, except when one of them happens to be a writer of comedies.  And all those who persuaded you by means of envy and slander&mdash;and some also persuaded others because they had been themselves persuaded&mdash;all these are most difficult to cope with;  for it is not even possible to call any of them up here and cross-question him, but I am compelled in making my defence to fight, as it were, absolutely with shadows and to cross-question when nobody answers.  Be kind enough, then, to bear in mind, as I say, that there are two classes
<milestone n="18e" unit="section"/>of my accusers&mdash;one those who have just brought their accusation, the other those who, as I was just saying, brought it long ago, and consider that I must defend myself first against the latter;  for you heard them making their charges first and with much greater force than these who made them later.  Well, then, I must make a defence, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>,
<milestone unit="page" n="19"/><milestone n="19a" unit="section"/>and must try in so short a time to remove from you this prejudice which you have been for so long a time acquiring.  Now I wish that this might turn out so, if it is better for you and for me, and that I might succeed with my defence;  but I think it is difficult, and I am not at all deceived about its nature.  But nevertheless, let this be as is pleasing to God, the law must be obeyed and I must make a defence.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Now let us take up from the beginning the question, what the accusation is from which the false prejudice against me has arisen, in which
<milestone n="19b" unit="section"/>Meletus trusted when he brought this suit against me.  What did those who aroused the prejudice say to arouse it?  I must, as it were, read their sworn statement as if they were plaintiffs:  &ldquo;Socrates is a criminal and a busybody, investigating the things beneath the earth and in the heavens and making the weaker argument stronger and
<milestone n="19c" unit="section"/>teaching others these same things.&rdquo;  Something of that sort it is.  For you yourselves saw these things in Aristophanes' comedy, a Socrates being carried about there, proclaiming that he was treading on air and uttering a vast deal of other nonsense, about which I know nothing, either much or little.  And I say this, not to cast dishonor upon such knowledge, if anyone is wise about such matters (may I never have to defend myself against Meletus on so great a charge as that!),&mdash;but I, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, have nothing to do with these things. 
<milestone n="19d" unit="section"/>And I offer as witnesses most of yourselves, and I ask you to inform one another and to tell, all those of you who ever heard me conversing&mdash;and there are many such among you&mdash;now tell, if anyone ever heard me talking much or little about such matters.  And from this you will perceive that such are also the other things that the multitude say about me.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>But in fact none of these things are true, and if you have heard from anyone that I undertake to teach
<milestone n="19e" unit="section"/>people and that I make money by it, that is not true either.  Although this also seems to me to be a fine thing, if one might be able to teach people, as Gorgias of Leontini and Prodicus of <placeName key="tgn,7010867">Ceos</placeName> and Hippias of <placeName key="perseus,Elis">Elis</placeName> are.  For each of these men, gentlemen, is able to go into any one of the cities and persuade the young men, who can associate for nothing with whomsoever they wish among their own fellow citizens,
<milestone unit="page" n="20"/><milestone n="20a" unit="section"/>to give up the association with those men and to associate with them and pay them money and be grateful besides.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>And there is also another wise man here, a Parian, who I learned was in town;  for I happened to meet a man who has spent more on sophists than all the rest, Callias, the son of Hipponicus;  so I asked him&mdash;for he has two sons&mdash;&ldquo;Callias,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;if your two sons had happened to be two colts or two calves, we should be able to get and hire for them an overseer who would make them
<milestone n="20b" unit="section"/>excellent in the kind of excellence proper to them;  and he would be a horse-trainer or a husbandman;  but now, since they are two human beings, whom have you in mind to get as overseer?  Who has knowledge of that kind of excellence, that of a man and a citizen?  For I think you have looked into the matter, because you have the sons.  Is there anyone,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;or not?&rdquo;  &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said he.  &ldquo;Who,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and where from, and what is his price for his teaching?&rdquo;  &ldquo;Evenus,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Socrates, from <placeName key="tgn,7011023">Paros</placeName>, five minae.&rdquo;  And I called Evenus blessed,
<milestone n="20c" unit="section"/>if he really had this art and taught so reasonably.  I myself should be vain and put on airs, if I understood these things;  but I do not understand them, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Now perhaps someone might rejoin:  &ldquo;But, Socrates, what is the trouble about you?  Whence have these prejudices against you arisen?  For certainly this great report and talk has not arisen while you were doing nothing more out of the way than the rest, unless you were doing something other than most people;  so tell us
<milestone n="20d" unit="section"/>what it is, that we may not act unadvisedly in your case.&rdquo;  The man who says this seems to me to be right, and I will try to show you what it is that has brought about my reputation and aroused the prejudice against me.  So listen.  And perhaps I shall seem to some of you to be joking;  be assured, however, I shall speak perfect truth to you.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>The fact is, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, that I have acquired this reputation on account of nothing else than a sort of wisdom.  What kind of wisdom is this?  Just that which is perhaps human wisdom.  For perhaps I really am wise in this wisdom;  and these men, perhaps,
<milestone n="20e" unit="section"/>of whom I was just speaking, might be wise in some wisdom greater than human, or I don't know what to say;  for I do not understand it, and whoever says I do, is lying and speaking to arouse prejudice against me.  And, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, do not interrupt me with noise, even if I seem to you to be boasting;  for the word which I speak is not mine, but the speaker to whom I shall refer it is a person of weight.  For of my wisdom&mdash;if it is wisdom at all&mdash;and of its nature, I will offer you the god of <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName> as a witness.  You know Chaerephon, I fancy. 
<milestone unit="page" n="21"/><milestone n="21a" unit="section"/>He was my comrade from a youth and the comrade of your democratic party, and shared in the recent exile and came back with you.  And you know the kind of man Chaerephon was, how impetuous in whatever he undertook.  Well, once he went to <placeName key="perseus,Delphi">Delphi</placeName> and made so bold as to ask the oracle this question;  and, gentlemen, don't make a disturbance at what I say;  for he asked if there were anyone wiser than I.  Now the Pythia replied that there was no one wiser.  And about these things his brother here will bear you witness, since Chaerephon is dead.
<milestone n="21b" unit="section"/> But see why I say these things;  for I am going to tell you whence the prejudice against me has arisen.  For when I heard this, I thought to myself:  &ldquo;What in the world does the god mean, and what riddle is he propounding?  For I am conscious that I am not wise either much or little.  What then does he mean by declaring that I am the wisest?  He certainly cannot be lying, for that is not possible for him.&rdquo;  And for a long time I was at a loss as to what he meant;  then with great reluctance I proceeded to investigate him somewhat as follows.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>I went to one of those who had a reputation for wisdom,
<milestone n="21c" unit="section"/>thinking that there, if anywhere, I should prove the utterance wrong and should show the oracle &ldquo;This man is wiser than I, but you said I was wisest.&rdquo;  So examining this man&mdash;for I need not call him by name, but it was one of the public men with regard to whom I had this kind of experience, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>&mdash;and conversing with him, this man seemed to me to seem to be wise to many other people and especially to himself, but not to be so;  and then I tried to show him that he thought
<milestone n="21d" unit="section"/>he was wise, but was not.  As a result, I became hateful to him and to many of those present;  and so, as I went away, I thought to myself, &ldquo;I am wiser than this man;  for neither of us really knows anything fine and good, but this man thinks he knows something when he does not, whereas I, as I do not know anything, do not think I do either.  I seem, then, in just this little thing to be wiser than this man at any rate, that what I do not know I do not think I know either.&rdquo;  From him I went to another of those who were reputed
<milestone n="21e" unit="section"/>to be wiser than he, and these same things seemed to me to be true;  and there I became hateful both to him and to many others.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>After this then I went on from one to another, perceiving that I was hated, and grieving and fearing, but nevertheless I thought I must consider the god's business of the highest importance.  So I had to go, investigating the meaning of the oracle, to all those who were reputed to know anything.  And by the Dog, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> 
<milestone unit="page" n="22"/><milestone n="22a" unit="section"/>&mdash;for I must speak the truth to you&mdash;this, I do declare, was my experience:  those who had the most reputation seemed to me to be almost the most deficient, as I investigated at the god's behest, and others who were of less repute seemed to be superior men in the matter of being sensible.  So I must relate to you my wandering as I performed my Herculean labors, so to speak, in order that the oracle might be proved to be irrefutable.  For after the public men I went to the poets, those of tragedies, and those of dithyrambs,
<milestone n="22b" unit="section"/>and the rest, thinking that there I should prove by actual test that I was less learned than they.  So, taking up the poems of theirs that seemed to me to have been most carefully elaborated by them, I asked them what they meant, that I might at the same time learn something from them.  Now I am ashamed to tell you the truth, gentlemen;  but still it must be told.  For there was hardly a man present, one might say, who would not speak better than they about the poems they themselves had composed.  So again in the case of the poets also I presently recognized this,
<milestone n="22c" unit="section"/>that what they composed they composed not by wisdom, but by nature and because they were inspired, like the prophets and givers of oracles;  for these also say many fine things, but know none of the things they say;  it was evident to me that the poets too had experienced something of this same sort.  And at the same time I perceived that they, on account of their poetry, thought that they were the wisest of men in other things as well, in which they were not.  So I went away from them also thinking that I was superior to them in the same thing in which I excelled the public men.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Finally then I went to the hand-workers. 
<milestone n="22d" unit="section"/>For I was conscious that I knew practically nothing, but I knew I should find that they knew many fine things.  And in this I was not deceived;  they did know what I did not, and in this way they were wiser than I.  But, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, the good artisans also seemed to me to have the same failing as the poets;  because of practicing his art well, each one thought he was very wise in the other most important matters, and this folly of theirs obscured that wisdom, so that I asked myself
<milestone n="22e" unit="section"/>in behalf of the oracle whether I should prefer to be as I am, neither wise in their wisdom nor foolish in their folly, or to be in both respects as they are.  I replied then to myself and to the oracle that it was better for me to be as I am.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Now from this investigation, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>,
<milestone unit="page" n="23"/><milestone n="23a" unit="section"/>many enmities have arisen against me, and such as are most harsh and grievous, so that many prejudices have resulted from them and I am called a wise man.  For on each occasion those who are present think I am wise in the matters in which I confute someone else;  but the fact is, gentlemen, it is likely that the god is really wise and by his oracle means this:  &ldquo;Human wisdom is of little or no value.&rdquo; And it appears that he does not really say this of Socrates, but merely uses my name,
<milestone n="23b" unit="section"/>and makes me an example, as if he were to say:  &ldquo;This one of you, O human beings, is wisest, who, like Socrates, recognizes that he is in truth of no account in respect to wisdom.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Therefore I am still even now going about and searching and investigating at the god's behest anyone, whether citizen or foreigner, who I think is wise;  and when he does not seem so to me, I give aid to the god and show that he is not wise.  And by reason of this occupation I have no leisure to attend to any of the affairs of the state worth mentioning, or of my own, but am in vast poverty
<milestone n="23c" unit="section"/>on account of my service to the god.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>And in addition to these things, the young men who have the most leisure, the sons of the richest men, accompany me of their own accord, find pleasure in hearing people being examined, and often imitate me themselves, and then they undertake to examine others;  and then, I fancy, they find a great plenty of people who think they know something, but know little or nothing.  As a result, therefore, those who are examined by them are angry with me, instead of being angry with themselves, and say that &ldquo;Socrates is a most abominable person
<milestone n="23d" unit="section"/>and is corrupting the youth.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>And when anyone asks them &ldquo;by doing or teaching what?&rdquo; they have nothing to say, but they do not know, and that they may not seem to be at a loss they say these things that are handy to say against all the philosophers, &ldquo;the things in the air and the things beneath the earth&rdquo; and &ldquo;not to believe in the gods&rdquo; and &ldquo;to make the weaker argument the stronger.&rdquo;  For they would not, I fancy, care to say the truth, that it is being made very clear that they pretend to know, but know nothing. 
<milestone n="23e" unit="section"/>Since, then, they are jealous of their honor and energetic and numerous and speak concertedly and persuasively about me, they have filled your ears both long ago and now with vehement slanders.  From among them Meletus attacked me, and Anytus and Lycon, Meletus angered on account of the poets, and Anytus on account of the artisans and the public men,
<milestone unit="page" n="24"/><milestone n="24a" unit="section"/>and Lycon on account of the orators;  so that, as I said in the beginning, I should be surprised if I were able to remove this prejudice from you in so short a time when it has grown so great.  There you have the truth, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, and I speak without hiding anything from you, great or small or prevaricating.  And yet I know pretty well that I am making myself hated by just that conduct;  which is also a proof that I am speaking the truth and that this is the prejudice against me and these are its causes.  And whether you investigate
<milestone n="24b" unit="section"/>this now or hereafter, you will find that it is so.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Now so far as the accusations are concerned which my first accusers made against me, this is a sufficient defence before you;  but against Meletus, the good and patriotic, as he says, and the later ones, I will try to defend myself next.  So once more, as if these were another set of accusers, let us take up in turn their sworn statement.  It is about as follows:  it states that Socrates is a wrongdoer because he corrupts the youth and does not believe in the gods the state believes in, but in other
<milestone n="24c" unit="section"/>new spiritual beings.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Such is the accusation.  But let us examine each point of this accusation.  He says I am a wrongdoer because I corrupt the youth.  But I, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, say Meletus is a wrongdoer, because he jokes in earnest, lightly involving people in a lawsuit, pretending to be zealous and concerned about things or which he never cared at all.  And that this is so I will try to make plain to you also.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Come here, Meletus, tell me:  don't you consider it
<milestone n="24d" unit="section"/>of great importance that the youth be as good as possible?  &ldquo;I do.&rdquo;  Come now, tell these gentlemen who makes them better?  For it is evident that you know, since you care about it.  For you have found the one who corrupts them, as you say, and you bring me before these gentlemen and accuse me;  and now, come, tell who makes them better and inform them who he is.  Do you see, Meletus, that you are silent and cannot tell?  And yet does it not seem to you disgraceful and a sufficient proof of what I say, that you have never cared about it?  But tell, my good man, who
<milestone n="24e" unit="section"/>makes them better?  &ldquo;The laws.&rdquo;  But that is not what I ask, most excellent one, but what man, who knows in the first place just this very thing, the laws.  &ldquo;These men, Socrates, the judges.&rdquo;  What are you saying, Meletus?  Are these gentlemen able to instruct the youth, and do they make them better?  &ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;  All, or some of them and others not?  &ldquo;All.&rdquo;  Well said, by Hera, and this is a great plenty of helpers you speak of.  But how about this? 
<milestone unit="page" n="25"/><milestone n="25a" unit="section"/>Do these listeners make them better, or not?  &ldquo;These also.&rdquo;  And how about the senators?  &ldquo;The senators also.&rdquo;  But, Meletus, those in the assembly, the assemblymen, don't corrupt the youth, do they?  or do they also all make them better?  &ldquo;They also.&rdquo;  All the Athenians, then, as it seems, make them excellent, except myself, and I alone corrupt them.  Is this what you mean?  &ldquo;Very decidedly, that is what I mean.&rdquo;  You have condemned me to great unhappiness!  But answer me;  does it seem to you to be so in the case of horses, that those who
<milestone n="25b" unit="section"/>make them better are all mankind, and he who injures them some one person?  Or, quite the opposite of this, that he who is able to make them better is some one person, or very few, the horse-trainers, whereas most people, if they have to do with and use horses, injure them?  Is it not so, Meletus, both in the case of horses and in that of all other animals?  Certainly it is, whether you and Anytus deny it or agree;  for it would be a great state of blessedness in the case of the youth if one alone corrupts them, and the others do them good.  But,
<milestone n="25c" unit="section"/>Meletus, you show clearly enough that you never thought about the youth, and you exhibit plainly your own carelessness, that you have not cared at all for the things about which you hale me into court.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>But besides, tell us, for heaven's sake, Meletus, is it better to live among good citizens, or bad?  My friend, answer;  for I am not asking anything hard.  Do not the bad do some evil to those who are with them at any time and the good some good?  &ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;  Is there then anyone who
<milestone n="25d" unit="section"/>prefers to be injured by his associates rather than benefited?  Answer, my good man;  for the law orders you to answer.  Is there anyone who prefers to be injured?  &ldquo;Of course not.&rdquo;  Come then, do you hale me in here on the ground that I am corrupting the youth and making them worse voluntarily or involuntarily?  &ldquo;Voluntarily I say.&rdquo;  What then, Meletus?  Are you at your age so much wiser than I at my age, that you have recognized that the evil always do some evil
<milestone n="25e" unit="section"/>to those nearest them, and the good some good;  whereas I have reached such a depth of ignorance that I do not even know this, that if I make anyone of my associates bad I am in danger of getting some harm from him, so that I do this great evil voluntarily, as you say?  I don't believe this, Meletus, nor do I think anyone else in the world does! 
<milestone unit="page" n="26"/><milestone n="26a" unit="section"/>but either I do not corrupt them, or if I corrupt them, I do it involuntarily, so that you are lying in both events.  But if I corrupt them involuntarily, for such involuntary errors the law is not to hale people into court, but to take them and instruct and admonish them in private.  For it is clear that if I am told about it, I shall stop doing that which I do involuntarily.  But you avoided associating with me and instructing me, and were unwilling to do so, but you hale me in here, where it is the law to hale in those who need punishment, not instruction.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>But enough of this, for, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, this is clear, as I said, that Meletus never
<milestone n="26b" unit="section"/>cared much or little for these things.  But nevertheless, tell us, how do you say, Meletus, that I corrupt the youth?  Or is it evident, according to the indictment you brought, that it is by teaching them not to believe in the gods the state believes in, but in other new spiritual beings?  Do you not say that it is by teaching this that I corrupt them?  &ldquo;Very decidedly that is what I say.&rdquo;  Then, Meletus, for the sake of
<milestone n="26c" unit="section"/>these very gods about whom our speech now is, speak still more clearly both to me and to these gentlemen.  For I am unable to understand whether you say that I teach that there are some gods, and myself then believe that there are some gods, and am not altogether godless and am not a wrongdoer in that way, that these, however, are not the gods whom the state believes in, but others, and this is what you accuse me for, that I believe in others;  or you say that I do not myself believe in gods at all and that I teach this unbelief to other people.  &ldquo;That is what I say, that you do not believe in gods at all.&rdquo;  You amaze me, Meletus!  Why do you say this? 
<milestone n="26d" unit="section"/>Do I not even believe that the sun or yet the moon are gods, as the rest of mankind do?  &ldquo;No, by Zeus, judges, since he says that the sun is a stone and the moon earth.&rdquo;  Do you think you are accusing Anaxagoras, my dear Meletus, and do you so despise these gentlemen and think they are so unversed in letters as not to know, that the books of Anaxagoras the Clazomenian are full of such utterances?  And forsooth the youth learn these doctrines from me, which they can buy sometimes
<milestone n="26e" unit="section"/>(if the price is high) for a drachma in the orchestra and laugh at Socrates, if he pretends they are his own, especially when they are so absurd!  But for heaven's sake, do you think this of me, that I do not believe there is any god?  &ldquo;No, by Zeus, you don't, not in the least.&rdquo;  You cannot be believed, Meletus, not even, as it seems to me, by yourself.  For this man appears to me, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, to be very violent and unrestrained, and actually to have brought this indictment in a spirit of violence and unrestraint and rashness.  For he seems,
<milestone unit="page" n="27"/><milestone n="27a" unit="section"/>as it were, by composing a puzzle to be making a test:  &ldquo;Will Socrates, the wise man, recognize that I am joking and contradicting myself, or shall I deceive him and the others who hear me?&rdquo;  For he appears to me to contradict himself in his speech, as if he were to say, &ldquo;Socrates is a wrongdoer, because he does not believe in gods, but does believe in gods.&rdquo;  And yet this is the conduct of a jester.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Join me, then, gentlemen, in examining how he appears to me to say this;  and do you, Meletus, answer; 
<milestone n="27b" unit="section"/>and you, gentlemen, as I asked you in the beginning, please bear in mind not to make a disturbance if I conduct my argument in my accustomed manner.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Is there any human being who believes that there are things pertaining to human beings, but no human beings?  Let him answer, gentlemen, and not make a disturbance in one way or another.  Is there anyone who does not believe in horses, but does believe in things pertaining to horses?  or who does not believe that flute-players exist, but that things pertaining to flute-players do?  There is not, best of men;  if you do not wish to answer, I say it to you and these others here.  But answer at least
<milestone n="27c" unit="section"/>the next question.  Is there anyone who believes spiritual things exist, but does not believe in spirits?  &ldquo;There is not.&rdquo;  Thank you for replying reluctantly when forced by these gentlemen.  Then you say that I believe in spiritual beings, whether new or old, and teach that belief;  but then I believe in spiritual beings at any rate, according to your statement, and you swore to that in your indictment.  But if I believe in spiritual beings, it is quite inevitable that I believe also in spirits;  is it not so?  It is;  for I assume that you agree, since you do not answer.  But do we not think the spirits are
<milestone n="27d" unit="section"/>gods or children of gods?  Yes, or no?  &ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;  Then if I believe in spirits, as you say, if spirits are a kind of gods, that would be the puzzle and joke which I say you are uttering in saying that I, while I do not believe in gods, do believe In gods again, since I believe in spirits;  but if, on the other hand, spirits are a kind of bastard children of gods, by nymphs or by any others, whoever their mothers are said to be, what man would believe that there are children of gods, but no gods?  It would be just as absurd
<milestone n="27e" unit="section"/>as if one were to believe that there are children of horses and asses, namely mules, but no horses and asses.  But, Meletus, you certainly must have brought this suit either to make a test of us or because you were loss as to what true wrongdoing you could accuse me of;  but there is no way for you to persuade any man who has even a little sense that it is possible for the same person to believe in spiritual and divine existences and again for the same person not to believe in spirits or gods or
<milestone unit="page" n="28"/><milestone n="28a" unit="section"/>heroes.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Well then, men of Athens, that I am not a wrongdoer according to Meletus's indictment, seems to me not to need much of a defence, but what has been said is enough.  But you may be assured that what I said before is true, that great hatred has arisen against me and in the minds of many persons.  And this it is which will cause my condemnation, if it is to cause it, not Meletus or Anytus, but the prejudice and dislike of the many.  This has condemned many other good men, and I think will do so; 
<milestone n="28b" unit="section"/>and there is no danger that it will stop with me.  But perhaps someone might say:  &ldquo;Are you then not ashamed, Socrates, of having followed such a pursuit, that you are now in danger of being put to death as a result?&rdquo;  But I should make to him a just reply:  &ldquo;You do not speak well, Sir, if you think a man in whom there is even a little merit ought to consider danger of life or death, and not rather regard this only, when he does things, whether the things he does are right or wrong and the acts of a good or a bad man.  For according to your argument all the demigods
    <milestone n="28c" unit="section"/>would be bad who died at <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>, including the son of Thetis, who so despised danger, in comparison with enduring any disgrace, that when his mother (and she was a goddess) said to him, as he was eager to slay Hector, something like this, I believe, <quote type="verse"><l met="dactylic">My son, if you avenge the death of your friend Patroclus and kill Hector, you yourself shall die;</l><l>for straightway, after Hector, is death appointed unto you;</l></quote><note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes"><bibl n="Hom. Il. 18.96">Hom. Il. 18.96</bibl>.</note>he, when he heard this, made light of death and danger,
<milestone n="28d" unit="section"/>and feared much more to live as a coward and not to avenge his friends, and said, <quote type="verse">Straightway may I die, after doing vengeance upon the wrongdoer, that I may not stay here, jeered at beside the curved ships, a burden of the earth.</quote>. Do you think he considered death and danger?<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>For thus it is, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, in truth;  wherever a man stations himself, thinking it is best to be there, or is stationed by his commander, there he must, as it seems to me, remain and run his risks, considering neither death nor any other thing more than disgrace.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>So I should have done a terrible thing,
<milestone n="28e" unit="section"/>if, when the commanders whom you chose to command me stationed me, both at <placeName key="tgn,6004814">Potidaea</placeName> and at <placeName key="perseus,Amphipolis">Amphipolis</placeName> and at <placeName key="tgn,6001700">Delium</placeName>, I remained where they stationed me, like anybody else, and ran the risk of death, but when the god gave me a station, as I believed and understood, with orders to spend my life in philosophy and in examining myself and others,
<milestone unit="page" n="29"/><milestone n="29a" unit="section"/>then I were to desert my post through fear of death or anything else whatsoever.  It would be a terrible thing, and truly one might then justly hale me into court, on the charge that I do not believe that there are gods, since I disobey the oracle and fear death and think I am wise when I am not.  For to fear death, gentlemen, is nothing else than to think one is wise when one is not;  for it is thinking one knows what one does not know.  For no one knows whether death be not even the greatest of all blessings to man, but they fear it as if they knew that it is the greatest of evils. 
<milestone n="29b" unit="section"/>And is not this the most reprehensible form of ignorance, that of thinking one knows what one does not know?  Perhaps, gentlemen, in this matter also I differ from other men in this way, and if I were to say that I am wiser in anything, it would be in this, that not knowing very much about the other world, I do not think I know.  But I do know that it is evil and disgraceful to do wrong and to disobey him who is better than I, whether he be god or man.  So I shall never fear or avoid those things concerning which I do not know whether they are good or bad rather than those which I know are bad.  And therefore, even if
<milestone n="29c" unit="section"/>you acquit me now and are not convinced by Anytus, who said that either I ought not to have been brought to trial at all, or since was brought to trial, I must certainly be put to death, adding that if I were acquitted your sons would all be utterly ruined by practicing what I teach&mdash;if you should say to me in reply to this:  &ldquo;Socrates, this time we will not do as Anytus says, but we will let you go, on this condition, however, that you no longer spend your time in this investigation or in philosophy, and if you are caught doing so again you shall die&rdquo;; 
<milestone n="29d" unit="section"/>if you should let me go on this condition which I have mentioned, I should say to you, &ldquo;Men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, I respect and love you, but I shall obey the god rather than you, and while I live and am able to continue, I shall never give up philosophy or stop exhorting you and pointing out the truth to any one of you whom I may meet, saying in my accustomed way:  &ldquo;Most excellent man, are you who are a citizen of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, the greatest of cities and the most famous for wisdom and power, not ashamed to care for the acquisition of wealth
<milestone n="29e" unit="section"/>and for reputation and honor, when you neither care nor take thought for wisdom and truth and the perfection of your soul?&rdquo;  And if any of you argues the point, and says he does care, I shall not let him go at once, nor shall I go away, but I shall question and examine and cross-examine him, and if I find that he does not possess virtue, but says he does, I shall rebuke him for scorning
<milestone unit="page" n="30"/><milestone n="30a" unit="section"/>the things that are of most importance and caring more for what is of less worth.  This I shall do to whomever I meet, young and old, foreigner and citizen, but most to the citizens, inasmuch as you are more nearly related to me.  For know that the god commands me to do this, and I believe that no greater good ever came to pass in the city than my service to the god.  For I go about doing nothing else than urging you, young and old, not to care for your persons or your property
<milestone n="30b" unit="section"/>more than for the perfection of your souls, or even so much;  and I tell you that virtue does not come from money, but from virtue comes money and all other good things to man, both to the individual and to the state.  If by saying these things I corrupt the youth, these things must be injurious;  but if anyone asserts that I say other things than these, he says what is untrue.  Therefore I say to you, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, either do as Anytus tells you, or not, and either acquit me, or not, knowing that I shall not change my conduct even if I am
<milestone n="30c" unit="section"/>to die many times over.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Do not make a disturbance, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>;  continue to do what I asked of you, not to interrupt my speech by disturbances, but to hear me;  and I believe you will profit by hearing.  Now I am going to say some things to you at which you will perhaps cry out;  but do not do so by any means.  For know that if you kill me, I being such a man as I say I am, you will not injure me so much as yourselves;  for neither Meletus nor Anytus could injure me; 
<milestone n="30d" unit="section"/>that would be impossible, for I believe it is not God's will that a better man be injured by a worse.  He might, however, perhaps kill me or banish me or disfranchise me;  and perhaps he thinks he would thus inflict great injuries upon me, and others may think so, but I do not;  I think he does himself a much greater injury by doing what he is doing now&mdash;killing a man unjustly.  And so, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, I am now making my defence not for my own sake, as one might imagine, but far more for yours, that you may not by condemning me err in your treatment of the gift the God gave you. 
<milestone n="30e" unit="section"/>For if you put me to death, you will not easily find another, who, to use a rather absurd figure, attaches himself to the city as a gadfly to a horse, which, though large and well bred, is sluggish on account of his size and needs to be aroused by stinging.  I think the god fastened me upon the city in some such capacity, and I go about arousing,
<milestone unit="page" n="31"/><milestone n="31a" unit="section"/>and urging and reproaching each one of you, constantly alighting upon you everywhere the whole day long.  Such another is not likely to come to you, gentlemen;  but if you take my advice, you will spare me.  But you, perhaps, might be angry, like people awakened from a nap, and might slap me, as Anytus advises, and easily kill me;  then you would pass the rest of your lives in slumber, unless God, in his care for you, should send someone else to sting you.  And that I am, as I say, a kind of gift from the god,
<milestone n="31b" unit="section"/>you might understand from this;  for I have neglected all my own affairs and have been enduring the neglect of my concerns all these years, but I am always busy in your interest, coming to each one of you individually like a father or an elder brother and urging you to care for virtue;  now that is not like human conduct.  If I derived any profit from this and received pay for these exhortations, there would be some sense in it;  but now you yourselves see that my accusers, though they accuse me of everything else in such a shameless way, have not been able to work themselves up to such a pitch of shamelessness
<milestone n="31c" unit="section"/>as to produce a witness to testify that I ever exacted or asked pay of anyone.  For I think I have a sufficient witness that I speak the truth, namely, my poverty.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Perhaps it may seem strange that I go about and interfere in other people's affairs to give this advice in private, but do not venture to come before your assembly and advise the state.  But the reason for this, as you have heard me say
<milestone n="31d" unit="section"/>at many times and places, is that something divine and spiritual comes to me, the very thing which Meletus ridiculed in his indictment.  I have had this from my childhood;  it is a sort of voice that comes to me, and when it comes it always holds me back from what I am thinking of doing, but never urges me forward.  This it is which opposes my engaging in politics.  And I think this opposition is a very good thing;  for you may be quite sure, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, that if I had undertaken to go into politics, I should have been put to death long ago and should have done
<milestone n="31e" unit="section"/>no good to you or to myself.  And do not be angry with me for speaking the truth;  the fact is that no man will save his life who nobly opposes you or any other populace and prevents many unjust and illegal things from happening in the state. 
<milestone unit="page" n="32"/><milestone n="32a" unit="section"/>A man who really fights for the right, if he is to preserve his life for even a little while, must be a private citizen, not a public man.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>I will give you powerful proofs of this not mere words, but what you honor more,&mdash;actions.  And listen to what happened to me, that you may be convinced that I would never yield to any one, if that was wrong, through fear of death, but would die rather than yield.  The tale I am going to tell you is ordinary and commonplace, but true. 
<milestone n="32b" unit="section"/>I, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, never held any other office in the state, but I was a senator;  and it happened that my tribe held the presidency when you wished to judge collectively, not severally, the ten generals who had failed to gather up the slain after the naval battle;  this was illegal, as you all agreed afterwards.  At that time I was the only one of the prytanes who opposed doing anything contrary to the laws, and although the orators were ready to impeach and arrest me, and though you urged them with shouts to do so, I thought
<milestone n="32c" unit="section"/>I must run the risk to the end with law and justice on my side, rather than join with you when your wishes were unjust, through fear of imprisonment or death.  That was when the democracy still existed;  and after the oligarchy was established, the Thirty sent for me with four others to come to the rotunda and ordered us to bring <placeName key="tgn,7009120">Leon</placeName> the Salaminian from <placeName key="tgn,7002340">Salamis</placeName> to be put to death.  They gave many such orders to others also, because they wished to implicate as many in their crimes as they could.  Then I, however,
<milestone n="32d" unit="section"/>showed again, by action, not in word only, that I did not care a whit for death if that be not too rude an expression, but that I did care with all my might not to do anything unjust or unholy.  For that government, with all its power, did not frighten me into doing anything unjust, but when we came out of the rotunda, the other four went to <placeName key="tgn,7002340">Salamis</placeName> and arrested <placeName key="tgn,7009120">Leon</placeName>, but I simply went home;  and perhaps I should have been put to death for it, if the government had not
<milestone n="32e" unit="section"/>quickly been put down.  Of these facts you can have many witnesses.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Do you believe that I could have lived so many years if I had been in public life and had acted as a good man should act, lending my aid to what is just and considering that of the highest importance?  Far from it, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>;  nor could
<milestone unit="page" n="33"/><milestone n="33a" unit="section"/>any other man.  But you will find that through all my life, both in public, if I engaged in any public activity, and in private, I have always been the same as now, and have never yielded to any one wrongly, whether it were any other person or any of those who are said by my traducers to be my pupils.  But I was never any one's teacher.  If any one, whether young or old, wishes to hear me speaking and pursuing my mission, I have never objected,
<milestone n="33b" unit="section"/>nor do I converse only when I am paid and not otherwise, but I offer myself alike to rich and poor;  I ask questions, and whoever wishes may answer and hear what I say.  And whether any of them turns out well or ill, I should not justly be held responsible, since I never promised or gave any instruction to any of them;  but if any man says that he ever learned or heard anything privately from me, which all the others did not, be assured that he is lying.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>But why then do some people love
<milestone n="33c" unit="section"/>to spend much of their time with me?  You have heard the reason, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>;  for I told you the whole truth;  it is because they like to listen when those are examined who think they are wise and are not so;  for it is amusing.  But, as I believe, I have been commanded to do this by the God through oracles and dreams and in every way in which any man was ever commanded by divine power to do anything whatsoever.  This, Athenians, is true and easily tested.  For if I am corrupting some of the young men
<milestone n="33d" unit="section"/>and have corrupted others, surely some of them who have grown older, if they recognize that I ever gave them any bad advice when they were young, ought now to have come forward to accuse me.  Or if they did not wish to do it themselves, some of their relatives&mdash;fathers or brothers or other kinsfolk&mdash;ought now to tell the facts.  And there are many of them present, whom I see;  first Crito here,
<milestone n="33e" unit="section"/>who is of my own age and my own deme and father of Critobulus, who is also present;  then there is Lysanias the Sphettian, father of Aeschines, who is here;  and also Antiphon of Cephisus, father of Epigenes.  Then here are others whose brothers joined in my conversations, Nicostratus, son of Theozotides and brother of Theodotus (now Theodotus is dead, so he could not stop him by entreaties), and Paralus, son of Demodocus;  Theages was his brother;  and
<milestone unit="page" n="34"/><milestone n="34a" unit="section"/>Adimantus, son of Aristo, whose brother is Plato here;  and Aeantodorus, whose brother Apollodorus is present.  And I can mention to you many others, some one of whom Meletus ought certainly to have produced as a witness in his speech;  but if he forgot it then, let him do so now;  I yield the floor to him, and let him say, if he has any such testimony.  But you will find that the exact opposite is the case, gentlemen, and that they are all ready to aid me, the man who corrupts and injures their relatives, as Meletus and Anytus say. 
<milestone n="34b" unit="section"/>Now those who are themselves corrupted might have some motive in aiding me;  but what reason could their relatives have, who are not corrupted and are already older men, unless it be the right and true reason, that they know that Meletus is lying and I am speaking the truth?<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Well, gentlemen, this, and perhaps more like this, is about all I have to say in my defence.  Perhaps some one among you may be offended
<milestone n="34c" unit="section"/>when he remembers his own conduct, if he, even in a case of less importance than this, begged and besought the judges with many tears, and brought forward his children to arouse compassion, and many other friends and relatives;  whereas I will do none of these things, though I am, apparently, in the very greatest danger.  Perhaps some one with these thoughts in mind may be harshly disposed toward me and may cast his vote in anger.  Now if any one of you is so disposed 
    <milestone n="34d" unit="section"/>&mdash;I do not believe there is such a person&mdash;but if there should be, I think I should be speaking fairly if I said to him, My friend, I too have relatives, for I am, as Homer has it, <quote type="verse"><l met="dactylic">not born of an oak or a rock,</l></quote><note anchored="yes" n="Loeb"><bibl n="Hom. Od. 19.163">Hom. Od. 19.163</bibl>.</note>but of human parents, so that I have relatives and, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, I have three sons, one nearly grown up, and two still children;  but nevertheless I shall not bring any of them here and beg you to acquit me.  And why shall I not do so?  Not because I am stubborn, Athenians,
<milestone n="34e" unit="section"/>or lack respect for you.  Whether I fear death or not is another matter, but for the sake of my good name and yours and that of the whole state, I think it is not right for me to do any of these things in view of my age and my reputation, whether deserved or not;  for at any rate the opinion prevails that Socrates
<milestone unit="page" n="35"/><milestone n="35a" unit="section"/>is in some way superior to most men.  If then those of you who are supposed to be superior either in wisdom or in courage or in any other virtue whatsoever are to behave in such a way, it would be disgraceful.  Why, I have often seen men who have some reputation behaving in the strangest manner, when they were on trial, as if they thought they were going to suffer something terrible if they were put to death, just as if they would be immortal if you did not kill them.  It seems to me that they are a disgrace to the state and that any stranger might say that those of the Athenians who excel
<milestone n="35b" unit="section"/>in virtue, men whom they themselves honor with offices and other marks of esteem, are no better than women.  Such acts, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, we who have any reputation at all ought not to commit, and if we commit them you ought not to allow it, but you should make it clear that you will be much more ready to condemn a man who puts before you such pitiable scenes and makes the city ridiculous than one who keeps quiet.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>But apart from the question of reputation, gentlemen, I think it is not right
<milestone n="35c" unit="section"/>to implore the judge or to get acquitted by begging;  we ought to inform and convince him.  For the judge is not here to grant favors in matters of justice, but to give judgement;  and his oath binds him not to do favors according to his pleasure, but to judge according to the laws;  therefore, we ought not to get you into the habit of breaking your oaths, nor ought you to fall into that habit;  for neither of us would be acting piously.  Do not, therefore, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, demand of me that I act before you in a way which I consider neither honorable nor right nor pious,
<milestone n="35d" unit="section"/>especially when impiety is the very thing for which Meletus here has brought me to trial.  For it is plain that if by persuasion and supplication I forced you to break your oaths I should teach you to disbelieve in the existence of the gods and in making my defence should accuse myself of not believing in them.  But that is far from the truth;  for I do believe in them, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, more than any of my accusers, and I entrust my case to you and to God to decide it as shall be best for me and for you.
<milestone n="2" unit="speech"/>
<milestone n="35e" unit="section"/> I am not grieved, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>,
<milestone unit="page" n="36"/><milestone n="36a" unit="section"/>at this vote of condemnation you have cast against me, and that for many reasons, among them the fact that your decision was not a surprise to me.  I am much more surprised by the number of votes for and against it;  for I did not expect so small a majority, but a large one.  Now, it seems, if only thirty votes had been cast the other way, I should have been acquitted.  And so, I think, so far as Meletus is concerned, I have even now been acquitted, and not merely acquitted, but anyone can see that, if Anytus and Lycon had not come forward to accuse me, he would have been fined
<milestone n="36b" unit="section"/>a thousand drachmas for not receiving a fifth part of the votes.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>And so the man proposes the penalty of death.  Well, then, what shall I propose as an alternative?  Clearly that which I deserve, shall I not?  And what do I deserve to suffer or to pay, because in my life I did not keep quiet, but neglecting what most men care for&mdash;money-making and property, and military offices, and public speaking, and the various offices and plots and parties that come up in the state&mdash;and thinking that I was really too honorable
<milestone n="36c" unit="section"/>to engage in those activities and live, refrained from those things by which I should have been of no use to you or to myself, and devoted myself to conferring upon each citizen individually what I regard as the greatest benefit?  For I tried to persuade each of you to care for himself and his own perfection in goodness and wisdom rather than for any of his belongings, and for the state itself rather than for its interests, and to follow the same method in his care for other things.  What, then, does such a man as I deserve? 
<milestone n="36d" unit="section"/>Some good thing, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, if I must propose something truly in accordance with my deserts;  and the good thing should be such as is fitting for me.  Now what is fitting for a poor man who is your benefactor, and who needs leisure to exhort you?  There is nothing, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, so fitting as that such a man be given his meals in the prytaneum.  That is much more appropriate for me than for any of you who has won a race at the Olympic games with a pair of horses or a four-in-hand.  For he makes you seem to be happy, whereas I make you happy in reality; 
<milestone n="36e" unit="section"/>and he is not at all in need of sustenance, but I am needy.  So if I must propose a penalty in accordance with my deserts,
<milestone unit="page" n="37"/><milestone n="37a" unit="section"/>I propose maintenance in the prytaneum.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Perhaps some of you think that in saying this, as in what I said about lamenting and imploring, I am speaking in a spirit of bravado;  but that is not the case.  The truth is rather that I am convinced that I never intentionally wronged anyone;  but I cannot convince you of this, for we have conversed with each other only a little while.  I believe if you had a law, as some other people have,
<milestone n="37b" unit="section"/>that capital cases should not be decided in one day, but only after several days, you would be convinced;  but now it is not easy to rid you of great prejudices in a short time.  Since, then, I am convinced that I never wronged any one, I am certainly not going to wrong myself, and to say of myself that I deserve anything bad, and to propose any penalty of that sort for myself.  Why should I?  Through fear of the penalty that Meletus proposes, about which I say that I do not know whether it is a good thing or an evil?  Shall I choose instead of that something which I know to be an evil?  What penalty shall I propose?  Imprisonment? 
<milestone n="37c" unit="section"/>And why should I live in prison a slave to those who may be in authority?  Or shall I propose a fine, with imprisonment until it is paid?  But that is the same as what I said just now, for I have no money to pay with.  Shall I then propose exile as my penalty?  Perhaps you would accept that.  I must indeed be possessed by a great love of life if I am so irrational as not to know that if you, who are my fellow citizens, could not
<milestone n="37d" unit="section"/>endure my conversation and my words, but found them too irksome and disagreeable, so that you are now seeking to be rid of them, others will not be willing to endure them.  No, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, they certainly will not.  A fine life I should lead if I went away at my time of life, wandering from city to city and always being driven out!  For well I know that wherever I go, the young men will listen to my talk, as they do here;  and if I drive them away, they will themselves persuade their elders to drive me out, and if
<milestone n="37e" unit="section"/>I do not drive them away, their fathers and relatives will drive me out for their sakes.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Perhaps someone might say, &ldquo;Socrates, can you not go away from us and live quietly, without talking?&rdquo;  Now this is the hardest thing to make some of you believe.  For if I say that such conduct would be disobedience to the god and that therefore I cannot keep quiet, you will think I am jesting and will not believe me; 
<milestone unit="page" n="38"/><milestone n="38a" unit="section"/>and if again I say that to talk every day about virtue and the other things about which you hear me talking and examining myself and others is the greatest good to man, and that the unexamined life is not worth living, you will believe me still less.  This is as I say, gentlemen, but it is not easy to convince you.  Besides, I am not accustomed to think that I deserve anything bad.  If I had money, I would have proposed a fine,
<milestone n="38b" unit="section"/>as large as I could pay;  for that would have done me no harm.  But as it is&mdash;I have no money, unless you are willing to impose a fine which I could pay.  I might perhaps pay a mina of silver.  So I propose that penalty;  but Plato here, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, and Crito and Critobulus, and Aristobulus tell me to propose a fine of thirty minas, saying that they are sureties for it.  So I propose a fine of that amount, and these men, who are amply sufficient, will be my sureties.
<milestone n="3" unit="speech"/><milestone n="38c" unit="section"/><milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>It is no long time, men of <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName>, which you gain, and for that those who wish to cast a slur upon the state will give you the name and blame of having killed Socrates, a wise man;  for, you know, those who wish to revile you will say I am wise, even though I am not.  Now if you had waited a little while, what you desire would have come to you of its own accord;  for you see how old I am, how far advanced in life and how near death.  I say this not to all of you,
<milestone n="38d" unit="section"/>but to those who voted for my death.  And to them also I have something else to say.  Perhaps you think, gentlemen, that I have been convicted through lack of such words as would have moved you to acquit me, if I had thought it right to do and say everything to gain an acquittal.  Far from it.  And yet it is through a lack that I have been convicted, not however a lack of words, but of impudence and shamelessness, and of willingness to say to you such things as you would have liked best to hear.  You would have liked to hear me wailing and lamenting and doing and saying
<milestone n="38e" unit="section"/>many things which are, as I maintain, unworthy of me&mdash;such things as you are accustomed to hear from others.  But I did not think at the time that I ought, on account of the danger I was in, to do anything unworthy of a free man, nor do I now repent of having made my defence as I did, but I much prefer to die after such a defence than to live after a defence of the other sort.  For neither in the court nor in war ought I
<milestone unit="page" n="39"/><milestone n="39a" unit="section"/>or any other man to plan to escape death by every possible means.  In battles it is often plain that a man might avoid death by throwing down his arms and begging mercy of his pursuers;  and there are many other means of escaping death in dangers of various kinds if one is willing to do and say anything.  But, gentlemen, it is not hard to escape death;  it is much harder to escape wickedness, for that runs faster than death. 
<milestone n="39b" unit="section"/>And now I, since I am slow and old, am caught by the slower runner, and my accusers, who are clever and quick, by the faster, wickedness.  And now I shall go away convicted by you and sentenced to death, and they go convicted by truth of villainy and wrong.  And I abide by my penalty, and they by theirs.  Perhaps these things had to be so, and I think they are well.
<milestone n="39c" unit="section"/> And now I wish to prophesy to you, O ye who have condemned me;  for I am now at the time when men most do prophesy, the time just before death.  And I say to you, ye men who have slain me, that punishment will come upon you straight-way after my death, far more grievous in sooth than the punishment of death which you have meted out to me.  For now you have done this to me because you hoped that you would be relieved from rendering an account of your lives, but I say that you will find the result far different.  Those who will force you to give an account will be more numerous than heretofore; 
<milestone n="39d" unit="section"/>men whom I restrained, though you knew it not;  and they will be harsher, inasmuch as they are younger, and you will be more annoyed.  For if you think that by putting men to death you will prevent anyone from reproaching you because you do not act as you should, you are mistaken.  That mode of escape is neither possible at all nor honorable, but the easiest and most honorable escape is not by suppressing others, but by making yourselves as good as possible.  So with this prophecy to you who condemned me
<milestone n="39e" unit="section"/>I take my leave.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>But with those who voted for my acquittal I should like to converse about this which has happened, while the authorities are busy and before I go to the place where I must die.  Wait with me so long, my friends;  for nothing prevents our chatting with each other
<milestone unit="page" n="40"/><milestone n="40a" unit="section"/>while there is time.  I feel that you are my friends, and I wish to show you the meaning of this which has now happened to me.  For, judges&mdash;and in calling you judges I give you your right name&mdash;a wonderful thing has happened to me.  For hitherto the customary prophetic monitor always spoke to me very frequently and opposed me even in very small matters, if I was going to do anything I should not;  but now, as you yourselves see, this thing which might be thought, and is generally considered, the greatest of evils has come upon me;  but the divine sign did not oppose me
<milestone n="40b" unit="section"/>either when I left my home in the morning, or when I came here to the court, or at any point of my speech, when I was going to say anything;  and yet on other occasions it stopped me at many points in the midst of a speech;  but now, in this affair, it has not opposed me in anything I was doing or saying.  What then do I suppose is the reason?  I will tell you.  This which has happened to me is doubtless a good thing, and those of us who think death is an evil
<milestone n="40c" unit="section"/>must be mistaken.  A convincing proof of this been given me;  for the accustomed sign would surely have opposed me if I had not been going to meet with something good.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Let us consider in another way also how good reason there is to hope that it is a good thing.  For the state of death is one of two things:  either it is virtually nothingness, so that the dead has no consciousness of anything, or it is, as people say, a change and migration of the soul from this to another place.  And if it is unconsciousness,
<milestone n="40d" unit="section"/>like a sleep in which the sleeper does not even dream, death would be a wonderful gain.  For I think if any one were to pick out that night in which he slept a dreamless sleep and, comparing with it the other nights and days of his life, were to say, after due consideration, how many days and nights in his life had passed more pleasantly than that night,&mdash;I believe that not only any private person, but even the great King of <placeName key="tgn,7000231">Persia</placeName> himself
<milestone n="40e" unit="section"/>would find that they were few in comparison with the other days and nights.  So if such is the nature of death, I count it a gain;  for in that case, all time seems to be no longer than one night.  But on the other hand, if death is, as it were, a change of habitation from here to some other place, and if what we are told is true, that all the dead are there, what greater blessing could there be, judges?  For if a man when he reaches the other world,
<milestone unit="page" n="41"/><milestone n="41a" unit="section"/>after leaving behind these who claim to be judges, shall find those who are really judges who are said to sit in judgment there, Minos and Rhadamanthus, and Aeacus and Triptolemus, and all the other demigods who were just men in their lives, would the change of habitation be undesirable?  Or again, what would any of you give to meet with Orpheus and Musaeus and Hesiod and Homer?  I am willing to die many times over, if these things are true;  for I personally should find the life there wonderful,
<milestone n="41b" unit="section"/>when I met Palamedes or Ajax, the son of Telamon, or any other men of old who lost their lives through an unjust judgement, and compared my experience with theirs.  I think that would not be unpleasant.  And the greatest pleasure would be to pass my time in examining and investigating the people there, as I do those here, to find out who among them is wise and who thinks he is when he is not.  What price would any of you pay, judges, to examine him who led the great army against <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName>,
<milestone n="41c" unit="section"/>or Odysseus, or Sisyphus, or countless others, both men and women, whom I might mention?  To converse and associate with them and examine them would be immeasurable happiness.  At any rate, the folk there do not kill people for it;  since, if what we are told is true, they are immortal for all future time, besides being happier in other respects than men are here.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>But you also, judges, must regard death hopefully and must bear in mind this one truth,
<milestone n="41d" unit="section"/>that no evil can come to a good man either in life or after death, and God does not neglect him.  So, too, this which had come to me has not come by chance, but I see plainly that it was better for me to die now and be freed from troubles.  That is the reason why the sign never interfered with me, and I am not at all angry with those who condemned me or with my accusers.  And yet it was not with that in view that they condemned and accused me, but because
<milestone n="41e" unit="section"/>they thought to injure me.  They deserve blame for that.  However, I make this request of them:  when my sons grow up, gentlemen, punish them by troubling them as I have troubled you;  if they seem to you to care for money or anything else more than for virtue, and if they think they amount to something when they do not, rebuke them as I have rebuked you because they do not care for what they ought, and think they amount to something when they are worth nothing.  If you do this, both I and my sons
<milestone unit="page" n="42"/><milestone n="42a" unit="section"/>shall have received just treatment from you.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>But now the time has come to go away.  I go to die, and you to live;  but which of us goes to the better lot, is known to none but God.</p></body></text>

Or isn't it still early?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Crito</speaker><p>Yes, very early.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>About what time?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Crito</speaker><p>Just before dawn.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>I am surprised that the watchman of the prison was willing to let you in.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Crito</speaker><p>He is used to me by this time, Socrates, because I come here so often, and besides I have done something for him.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Have you just come, or some time ago?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Crito</speaker><p>Some little time ago.
<milestone n="43b" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then why did you not wake me at once, instead of sitting by me in silence?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Crito</speaker><p>No, no, by Zeus, Socrates, I only wish I myself were not so sleepless and sorrowful.  But I have been wondering at you for some time, seeing how sweetly you sleep;  and I purposely refrained from waking you, that you might pass the time as pleasantly as possible.  I have often thought throughout your life hitherto that you were of a happy disposition, and I think so more than ever in this resent misfortune, since you bear it so easily and calmly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Well, Crito, it would be absurd
<milestone n="43c" unit="section"/>if at my age I were disturbed because I must die now.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Crito</speaker><p>Other men as old, Socrates, become involved in similar misfortunes, but their age does not in the least prevent them from being disturbed by their fate.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>That is true.  But why have you come so early?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Crito</speaker><p>To bring news, Socrates, sad news, though apparently not sad to you, but sad and grievous me and all your friends, and to few of them, I think, so grievous as to me.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>What is this news?  Has the ship come from <placeName key="perseus,Delos">Delos</placeName>,
<milestone n="43d" unit="section"/>at the arrival of which I am to die?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Crito</speaker><p>It has not exactly come, but I think it will come today from the reports of some men who have come from Sunium and left it there.  Now it is clear from what they say that it will come today, and so tomorrow, Socrates, your life must end.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Well, Crito, good luck be with us!  If this is the will of the gods, so be it.  However, I do not think
<milestone unit="page" n="44"/><milestone n="44a" unit="section"/>it will come today.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Crito</speaker><p>What is your reason for not thinking so?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>I will tell you.  I must die on the day after the ship comes in, must I not?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Crito</speaker><p>So those say who have charge of these matters.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Well, I think it will not come in today, but tomorrow.  And my reason for this is a dream which I had a little while ago in the course of this night.  And perhaps you let me sleep just at the right time.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Crito</speaker><p>What was the dream?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>I dreamed that a beautiful, fair woman, clothed in white raiment, came to me and called me
    <milestone n="44b" unit="section"/>and said, &ldquo;Socrates, <quote type="verse"><l met="dactylic">on the third day thou wouldst come to fertile <placeName key="perseus,Phthia">Phthia</placeName>.&rdquo;</l></quote><note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes"><bibl n="Hom. Il. 9.363">Hom. Il. 9.363</bibl>.</note></p></sp><sp><speaker>Crito</speaker><p>A strange dream, Socrates.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>No, a clear one, at any rate, I think, Crito.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Crito</speaker><p>Too clear, apparently.  But, my dear Socrates, even now listen to me and save yourself.  Since, if you die, it will be no mere single misfortune to me, but I shall lose a friend such as I can never find again, and besides, many persons who do not know you and me well
<milestone n="44c" unit="section"/>will think I could have saved you if I had been willing to spend money, but that I would not take the trouble.  And yet what reputation could be more disgraceful than that of considering one's money of more importance than one's friends?  For most people will not believe that we were eager to help you to go away from here, but you refused.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>But, my dear Crito, why do we care so much for what most people think?  For the most reasonable men, whose opinion is more worth considering, will think that things were done as they really will be done.
<milestone n="44d" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Crito</speaker><p>But you see it is necessary, Socrates, to care for the opinion of the public, for this very trouble we are in now shows that the public is able to accomplish not by any means the least, but almost the greatest of evils, if one has a bad reputation with it.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>I only wish, Crito, the people could accomplish the greatest evils, that they might be able to accomplish also the greatest good things.  Then all would be well.  But now they can do neither of the two;  for they are not able to make a man wise or foolish, but they do whatever occurs to them.
<milestone n="44e" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Crito</speaker><p>That may well be.  But, Socrates, tell me this:  you are not considering me and your other friends, are you, fearing that, if you escape, the informers will make trouble for us by saying that we stole you away, and we shall be forced to lose either all our property or a good deal of money, or be punished in some other way besides? 
<milestone unit="page" n="45"/><milestone n="45a" unit="section"/>For if you are afraid of anything of that kind, let it go;  since it is right for us to run this risk, and even greater risk than this, if necessary, provided we save you.  Now please do as I ask.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>I am considering this, Crito, and many other things.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Crito</speaker><p>Well, do not fear this!  for it is not even a large sum of money which we should pay to some men who are willing to save you and get you away from here.  Besides, don't you see how cheap these informers are, and that not much money would be needed to silence them?  And you
<milestone n="45b" unit="section"/>have my money at your command, which is enough, I fancy;  and moreover, if because you care for me you think you ought not to spend my money, there are foreigners here willing to spend theirs;  and one of them, Simmias of <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName>, has brought for this especial purpose sufficient funds;  and Cebes also and very many others are ready.  So, as I say, do not give up saving yourself through fear of this.  And do not be troubled by what you said in the court, that if you went away you would not know what to do with yourself.  For in many other places, wherever you go,
<milestone n="45c" unit="section"/>they will welcome you;  and if you wish to go to <placeName key="tgn,7001399">Thessaly</placeName>, I have friends there who will make much of you and will protect you, so that no one in <placeName key="tgn,7001399">Thessaly</placeName> shall annoy you.  And besides, Socrates, it seems to me the thing you are undertaking to do is not even right&mdash;betraying yourself when you might save yourself.  And you are eager to bring upon yourself just what your enemies would wish and just what those were eager for who wished to destroy you.  And moreover, I think you are abandoning your children, too,
<milestone n="45d" unit="section"/>for when you might bring them up and educate them, you are going to desert them and go away, and, so far as you are concerned, their fortunes in life will be whatever they happen to meet with, and they will probably meet with such treatment as generally comes to orphans in their destitution.  No.  Either one ought not to beget children, or one ought to stay by them and bring them up and educate them.  But you seem to me to be choosing the laziest way;  and you ought to choose as a good and brave man would choose, you who have been saying all your life that you cared for virtue.  So I am shamed both for you and for us,
<milestone n="45e" unit="section"/>your friends, and I am afraid people will think that this whole affair of yours has been conducted with a sort of cowardice on our part&mdash;both the fact that the case came before the court, when it might have been avoided, and the way in which the trial itself was carried on, and finally they will think, as the crowning absurdity of the whole affair, that this opportunity has escaped us through some base cowardice on our part,
<milestone unit="page" n="46"/><milestone n="46a" unit="section"/>since we did not save you, and you did not save yourself, though it was quite possible if we had been of any use whatever.  Take care, Socrates, that these things be not disgraceful, as well as evil, both to you and to us.  Just consider, or rather it is time not to consider any longer, but to have finished considering.  And there is just one possible plan;  for all this must be done in the coming night.  And if we delay it can no longer be done.  But I beg you, Socrates, do as I say and don't refuse.  
<milestone n="46b" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>My dear Crito, your eagerness is worth a great deal, if it should prove to be rightly directed;  but otherwise, the greater it is, the more hard to bear.  So we must examine the question whether we ought to do this or not;  for I am not only now but always a man who follows nothing but the reasoning which on consideration seems to me best.  Aud I cannot, now that this has happened to us, discard the arguments I used to advance, but they seem to me much the same as ever,
<milestone n="46c" unit="section"/>and I revere and honor the same ones as before.  And unless we can bring forward better ones in our present situation, be assured that I shall not give way to you, not even if the power of the multitude frighten us with even more terrors than at present, as children are frightened with goblins, threatening us with imprisonments and deaths and confiscations of property.  Now how could we examine the matter most reasonably?  By taking up first what you say about opinions and asking whether we were right when we always used to say that we ought to pay attention
<milestone n="46d" unit="section"/>to some opinions and not to others?  Or were we right before I was condemned to death, whereas it has how been made clear that we were talking merely for the sake of argument and it was really mere play and nonsense?  And I wish to investigate, Crito, in common with you, and see whether our former argument seems different to me under our present conditions, or the same, and whether we shall give it up or be guided by it.  But it used to be said, I think, by those who thought they were speaking sensibly, just as I was saying now, that of the opinions held by men
<milestone n="46e" unit="section"/>some ought to be highly esteemed and others not.  In God's name, Crito, do you not think this is correct?  For you, humanly speaking,
<milestone unit="page" n="47"/><milestone n="47a" unit="section"/>are not involved in the necessity of dying tomorrow, and therefore present conditions would not lead your judgment astray.  Now say, do you not think we were correct in saying that we ought not to esteem all the opinions of men, but some and not others, and not those of all men, but only of some?  What do you think?  Is not this true?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Crito</speaker><p>It is.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then we ought to esteem the good opinions and not the bad ones?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Crito</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And the good ones are those of the wise and the bad ones those of the foolish?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Crito</speaker><p>Of course.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Come then, what used we to say about this? 
<milestone n="47b" unit="section"/>If a man is an athlete and makes that his business, does he pay attention to every man's praise and blame and opinion or to those of one man only who is a physician or a trainer?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Crito</speaker><p>To those of one man only.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then he ought to fear the blame and welcome the praise of that one man and not of the multitude.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Crito</speaker><p>Obviously.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And he must act and exercise and eat and drink as the one man who is his director and who knows the business thinks best rather than as all the others think.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Crito</speaker><p>That is true.
<milestone n="47c" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Well then;  if he disobeys the one man and disregards his opinion and his praise, but regards words of the many who have no special knowledge, will he not come to harm?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Crito</speaker><p>Of course he will.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And what is this harm?  In what direction and upon what part of the one who disobeys does it act?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Crito</speaker><p>Evidently upon his body;  for that is what it ruins.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Right.  Then in other matters, not to enumerate them all, in questions of right and wrong and disgraceful and noble and good and bad, which we are now considering, ought we to follow and fear
<milestone n="47d" unit="section"/>the opinion of the many or that of the one, if there is anyone who knows about them, whom we ought to revere and fear more than all the others?  And if we do not follow him, we shall injure and cripple that which we used to say is benefited by the right and is ruined by the wrong.  Or is there nothing in this?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Crito</speaker><p>I think it is true, Socrates.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Well then, if through yielding to the opinion of the ignorant we ruin that which is benefited by health and injured by disease,
<milestone n="47e" unit="section"/>is life worth living for us when that is ruined?  And that is the body, is it not?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Crito</speaker><p>Yes.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then is life worth living when the body is worthless and ruined?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Crito</speaker><p>Certainly not.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>But is it worth living when that is ruined which is injured by the wrong and improved by the right?  Or do we think that part of us, whatever it is, which is concerned with right and wrong,
<milestone unit="page" n="48"/><milestone n="48a" unit="section"/>is less important than the body?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Crito</speaker><p>By no means.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>But more important?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Crito</speaker><p>Much more.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then, most excellent friend, we must not consider at all what the many will say of us, but what he who knows about right and wrong, the one man, and truth herself will say.  And so you introduced the discussion wrongly in the first place, when you began by saying we ought to consider the opinion of the multitude about the right and the noble and the good and their opposites. 
<milestone n="48b" unit="section"/>But it might, of course, be said that the multitude can put us to death.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Crito</speaker><p>That is clear, too.  It would be said, Socrates.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>That is true.  But, my friend, the argument we have just finished seems to me still much the same as before;  and now see whether we still hold to this, or not, that it is not living, but living well which we ought to consider most important.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Crito</speaker><p>We do hold to it.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And that living well and living rightly are the same thing, do we hold to that, or not?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Crito</speaker><p>We do.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then we agree that the question is whether it is right for me to try to escape from here
<milestone n="48c" unit="section"/>without the permission of the Athenians, or not right.  And if it appears to be right, let us try it, and if not, let us give it up.  But the considerations you suggest, about spending money, and reputation, and bringing up my children, these are really, Crito, the reflections of those who lightly put men to death, and would bring them to life again, if they could, without any sense, I mean the multitude.  But we, since our argument so constrains us, must consider only the question we just broached, whether we shall be doing right in giving money
<milestone n="48d" unit="section"/>and thanks to these men who will help me to escape, and in escaping or aiding the escape ourselves, or shall in truth be doing wrong, if we do all these things.  And if it appears that it is wrong for us to do them, it may be that we ought not to consider either whether we must die if we stay here and keep quiet or whether we must endure any thing else whatsoever, but only the question of doing wrong.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Crito</speaker><p>I think what you say is right, Socrates;  but think what we should do.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Let us, my good friend, investigate in common, and if you can contradict anything I say, do so, and I will yield to your arguments; 
<milestone n="48e" unit="section"/>but if you cannot, my dear friend, stop at once saying the same thing to me over and over, that I ought to go away from here without the consent of the Athenians;  for I am anxious to act in this matter with your approval, and not contrary to your wishes.  Now see if the beginning of the investigation satisfies you, and try to reply
<milestone unit="page" n="49"/><milestone n="49a" unit="section"/>to my questions to the best of your belief.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Crito</speaker><p>I will try.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Ought we in no way to do wrong intentionally, or should we do wrong in some ways but not in others?  Or, as we often agreed in former times, is it never right or honorable to do wrong?  Or have all those former conclusions of ours been overturned in these few days, and have we old men,
<milestone n="49b" unit="section"/>seriously conversing with each other, failed all along to see that we were no better than children?  Or is not what we used to say most certainly true, whether the world agree or not?  And whether we must endure still more grievous sufferings than these, or lighter ones, is not wrongdoing inevitably an evil and a disgrace to the wrongdoer?  Do we believe this or not?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Crito</speaker><p>We do.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then we ought not to do wrong at all.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Crito</speaker><p>Why, no.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>And we ought not even to requite wrong with wrong, as the world thinks, since we must not do wrong at all.
<milestone n="49c" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Crito</speaker><p>Apparently not.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Well, Crito, ought one to do evil or not?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Crito</speaker><p>Certainly not, Socrates.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Well, then, is it right to requite evil with evil, as the world says it is, or not right?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Crito</speaker><p>Not right, certainly.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>For doing evil to people is the same thing as wronging them.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Crito</speaker><p>That is true.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then we ought neither to requite wrong with wrong nor to do evil to anyone, no matter what he may have done to us. 
<milestone n="49d" unit="section"/>And be careful, Crito, that you do not, in agreeing to this, agree to something you do not believe;  for I know that there are few who believe or ever will believe this.  Now those who believe this, and those who do not, have no common ground of discussion, but they must necessarily, in view of their opinions, despise one another.  Do you therefore consider very carefully whether you agree and share in this opinion, and let us take as the the starting point of our discussion the assumption that it is never right to do wrong or to requite wrong with wrong, or when we suffer evil to defend ourselves by doing evil in return.  Or do you disagree and refuse your assent
<milestone n="49e" unit="section"/>to this starting point?  For I have long held this belief and I hold it yet, but if you have reached any other conclusion, speak and explain it to me.  If you still hold to our former opinion, hear the next point.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Crito</speaker><p>I do hold to it and I agree with you;  so go on.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Now the next thing I say, or rather ask, is this:  &ldquo;ought a man to do what he has agreed to do, provided it is right, or may he violate his agreements?&rdquo;</p></sp><sp><speaker>Crito</speaker><p>He ought to do it.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Then consider whether, if we go away
<milestone unit="page" n="50"/><milestone n="50a" unit="section"/>from here without the consent of the state, we are doing harm to the very ones to whom we least ought to do harm, or not, and whether we are abiding by what we agreed was right, or not.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Crito</speaker><p>I cannot answer your question, Socrates, for I do not understand.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>Consider it in this way.  If, as I was on the point of running away (or whatever it should be called), the laws and the commonwealth should come to me and ask, &ldquo;Tell me, Socrates, what have you in mind to do?  Are you not intending by this thing you are trying to do, to destroy us,
<milestone n="50b" unit="section"/>the laws, and the entire state, so far as in you lies?  Or do you think that state can exist and not be overturned, in which the decisions reached by the courts have no force but are made invalid and annulled by private persons?&rdquo;  What shall we say, Crito, in reply to this question and others of the same kind?  For one might say many things, especially if one were an orator, about the destruction of that law which provides that the decisions reached by the courts shall be valid.  Or shall we say to them,
<milestone n="50c" unit="section"/>&ldquo;The state wronged me and did not judge the case rightly&rdquo;?  Shall we say that, or what?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Crito</speaker><p>That is what we shall say, by Zeus, Socrates.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>What then if the laws should say, &ldquo;Socrates, is this the agreement you made with us, or did you agree to abide by the verdicts pronounced by the state?&rdquo;  Now if I were surprised by what they said, perhaps they would continue, &ldquo;Don't be surprised at what we say, Socrates, but answer, since you are in the habit of employing the method of question and answer.  Come,
<milestone n="50d" unit="section"/>what fault do you find with us and the state, that you are trying to destroy us?  In the first place, did we not bring you forth?  Is it not through us that your father married your mother and begat you?  Now tell us, have you any fault to find with those of us who are the laws of marriage?&rdquo;  &ldquo;I find no fault,&rdquo; I should say.  &ldquo;Or with those that have to do with the nurture of the child after he is born and with his education which you, like others, received?  Did those of us who are assigned to these matters not give good directions when we told your father to educate you in music and gymnastics?&rdquo; 
<milestone n="50e" unit="section"/>&ldquo;You did,&rdquo; I should say.  &ldquo;Well then, when you were born and nurtured and educated, could you say to begin with that you were not our offspring and our slave, you yourself and your ancestors?  And if this is so, do you think right as between you and us rests on a basis of equality, so that whatever we undertake to do to you it is right for you to retaliate?  There was no such equality of right between you and your father or your master, if you had one, so that whatever treatment you received you might return it, answering them if you were reviled,
<milestone unit="page" n="51"/><milestone n="51a" unit="section"/>or striking back if you were struck, and the like;  and do you think that it will be proper for you to act so toward your country and the laws, so that if we undertake to destroy you, thinking it is right, you will undertake in return to destroy us laws and your country, so far as you are able, and will say that in doing this you are doing right, you who really care for virtue?  Or is your wisdom such that you do not see that your country is more precious and more to be revered and is holier and in higher esteem
<milestone n="51b" unit="section"/>among the gods and among men of understanding than your mother and your father and all your ancestors, and that you ought to show to her more reverence and obedience and humility when she is angry than to your father, and ought either to convince her by persuasion or to do whatever she commands, and to suffer, if she commands you to suffer, in silence, and if she orders you to be scourged or imprisoned or if she leads you to war to be wounded or slain, her will is to be done, and this is right, and you must not give way or draw back or leave your post, but in war and in court and everywhere,
<milestone n="51c" unit="section"/>you must do whatever the state, your country, commands, or must show her by persuasion what is really right, but that it is impious to use violence against either your father or your mother, and much more impious to use it against your country?&rdquo;  What shall we reply to this, Crito, that the laws speak the truth, or not?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Crito</speaker><p>I think they do.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>&ldquo;Observe then, Socrates,&rdquo; perhaps the laws would say, &ldquo;that if what we say is true, what you are now undertaking to do to us is not right.  For we brought you into the world, nurtured you, and gave a share of all the good things
<milestone n="51d" unit="section"/>we could to you and all the citizens.  Yet we proclaim, by having offered the opportunity to any of the Athenians who wishes to avail himself of it, that anyone who is not pleased with us when he has become a man and has seen the administration of the city and us, the laws, may take his goods and go away wherever he likes.  And none of us stands in the way or forbids any of you to take his goods and go away wherever he pleases, if we and the state do not please him, whether it be to an Athenian colony or to a foreign country where he will live as an alien.  But we say that
<milestone n="51e" unit="section"/>whoever of you stays here, seeing how we administer justice and how we govern the state in other respects, has thereby entered into an agreement with us to do what we command;  and we say that he who does not obey does threefold wrong, because he disobeys us who are his parents, because he disobeys us who nurtured him, and because after agreeing to obey us he neither obeys us nor convinces us that
<milestone unit="page" n="52"/><milestone n="52a" unit="section"/>we are wrong, though we give him the opportunity and do not roughly order him to do what we command, but when we allow him a choice of two things, either to convince us of error or to do our bidding, he does neither of these things.&rdquo;  &ldquo;We say that you, Socrates, will be exposed to these reproaches, if you do what you have in mind, and you not least of the Athenians but more than most others.&rdquo;  If then I should say, &ldquo;How so?&rdquo; perhaps they might retort with justice that I had made this agreement with them more emphatically than most other Athenians.  For they would say,
<milestone n="52b" unit="section"/>&ldquo;Socrates, we have strong evidence that we and the city pleased you;  for you would never have stayed in it more than all other Athenians if you had not been better pleased with it than they;  you never went out from the city to a festival, or anywhere else, except on military service, and you never made any other journey, as other people do, and you had no wish to know any other city or other laws, but you were contented with us and our city.  So strongly did you prefer us
<milestone n="52c" unit="section"/>and agree to live in accordance with us;  and besides, you begat children in the city, showing that it pleased you.  And moreover even at your trial you might have offered exile as your penalty, if you wished, and might have done with the state's consent what you are now undertaking to do without it.  But you then put on airs and said you were not disturbed if you must die, and you preferred, as you said, death to exile.  And now you are not ashamed to think of those words and you do not respect us, the laws, since you are trying to bring us to naught; 
<milestone n="52d" unit="section"/>and you are doing what the meanest slave would do, since you are trying to run away contrary to the compacts and agreements you made with us that you would live in accordance with us.  First then, answer this question, whether we speak the truth or not when we say that you agreed, not in word, but by your acts, to live in accordance with us.&rdquo;  What shall we say to this, Crito?  Must we not agree that it is true?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Crito</speaker><p>We must, Socrates.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Socrates</speaker><p>&ldquo;Are you then,&rdquo; they would say, &ldquo;not breaking
<milestone n="52e" unit="section"/>your compacts and agreements with us, though you were not led into them by compulsion or fraud, and were not forced to make up your mind in a short time, but had seventy years, in which you could have gone away, if we did not please you and if you thought the agreements were unfair?  But you preferred neither <placeName key="tgn,7011065">Lacedaemon</placeName> nor <placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName>, which you are always saying are well governed, nor any other of the Greek states,
<milestone unit="page" n="53"/><milestone n="53a" unit="section"/>or of the foreign ones, but you went away from this city less than the lame and the blind and the other cripples.  So much more than the other Athenians were you satisfied with the city and evidently therefore with us, its laws;  for who would be pleased with a city apart from its laws?  And now will you not abide by your agreement?  You will if you take our advice, Socrates;  and you will not make yourself ridiculous by going away from the city.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;For consider.  By transgressing in this way and committing these errors, what good will you do to yourself or
<milestone n="53b" unit="section"/>any of your friends?  For it is pretty clear that your friends also will be exposed to the risk of banishment and the loss of their homes in the city or of their property.  And you yourself, if you go to one of the nearest cities, to <placeName key="perseus,Thebes">Thebes</placeName> or Megara&mdash;for both are well governed&mdash;will go as an enemy, Socrates, to their government, and all who care for their own cities will look askance at you, and will consider you a destroyer of the laws,
<milestone n="53c" unit="section"/>and you will confirm the judges in their opinion, so that they will think their verdict was just.  For he who is destroyer of the laws might certainly be regarded as a destroyer of young and thoughtless men.  Will you then avoid the well-governed cities and the most civilized men?  And if you do this will your life be worth living?  Or will you go to them and have the face to carry on&mdash;what kind of conversation, Socrates?  The same kind you carried on here, saying that virtue and justice and lawful things and the laws are the most precious things to men?  And do you not think that the conduct of Socrates would seem most disgraceful? 
<milestone n="53d" unit="section"/>You cannot help thinking so.  Or you will keep away from these places and go to Crito's friends in <placeName key="tgn,7001399">Thessaly</placeName>;  for there great disorder and lawlessness prevail, and perhaps they would be amused to hear of the ludicrous way in which you ran away from prison by putting on a disguise, a peasant's leathern cloak or some of the other things in which runaways dress themselves up, and changing your appearance.  But will no one say that you, an old man, who had probably but a short time yet to live,
<milestone n="53e" unit="section"/>clung to life with such shameless greed that you transgressed the highest laws?  Perhaps not, if you do not offend anyone;  but if you do, Socrates, you will have to listen to many things that would be a disgrace to you.  So you will live as an inferior and a slave to everyone.  And what will you do except feast in <placeName key="tgn,7001399">Thessaly</placeName>, as if you had gone to <placeName key="tgn,7001399">Thessaly</placeName> to attend a banquet?  What will become of our conversations about justice and
<milestone unit="page" n="54"/><milestone n="54a" unit="section"/>virtue?  But perhaps you wish to live for the sake of your children, that you may bring them up and educate them?  How so?  Will you take them to <placeName key="tgn,7001399">Thessaly</placeName> to be brought up and educated, making exiles of them, that you may give them that blessing also?  Or perhaps you will not do that, but if they are brought up here while you are living, will they be better brought up and educated if you are not with them than if you were dead?  Oh yes!  your friends will care for them.  Will they care for them if you go away to <placeName key="tgn,7001399">Thessaly</placeName> and not if you go away to the dwellings of the dead?  If those who say they are your friends
<milestone n="54b" unit="section"/>are of any use, we must believe they will care for them in both cases alike.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Ah, Socrates, be guided by us who tended your infancy.  Care neither for your children nor for life nor for anything else more than for the right, that when you come to the home of the dead, you may have all these things to say in your own defence.  For clearly if you do this thing it will not be better for you here, or more just or holier, no, nor for any of your friends, and neither will it be better when you reach that other abode.  Now, however, you will go away wronged, if you do go away, not by us,
<milestone n="54c" unit="section"/>the laws, but by men;  but if you escape after so disgracefully requiting wrong with wrong and evil with evil, breaking your compacts and agreements with us, and injuring those whom you least ought to injure&mdash;yourself, your friends, your country and us&mdash;we shall be angry with you while you live, and there our brothers, the laws in Hades' realm, will not receive you graciously;  for they will know that you tried, so far as in you lay, to destroy us.  Do not let Crito persuade you to do
<milestone n="54d" unit="section"/>what he says, but take our advice.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Be well assured, my dear friend, Crito, that this is what I seem to hear, as the frenzied dervishes of Cybele seem to hear the flutes, and this sound of these words re-echoes within me and prevents my hearing any other words.

I should like to hear, for nowadays none of the Phliasians go to <placeName key="perseus,Athens">Athens</placeName> at all, and no stranger has come from there for a long time,
<milestone n="57b" unit="section"/>who could tell us anything definite about this matter, except that he drank poison and died, so we could learn no further details.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Phaedo</speaker><p>Did you not even hear about the trial and how it was conducted?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Echecrates</speaker><p>Yes, some one told us about that, and we wondered that although it took place a long time ago, he was put to death much later.  Now why was that, Phaedo?
<milestone unit="page" n="58"/><milestone n="58a" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Phaedo</speaker><p>It was a matter of chance, Echecrates.  It happened that the stern of the ship which the Athenians send to <placeName key="perseus,Delos">Delos</placeName> was crowned on the day before the trial.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Echecrates</speaker><p>What ship is this?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Phaedo</speaker><p>This is the ship, as the Athenians say, in which Theseus once went to <placeName key="tgn,7012056">Crete</placeName> with the fourteen
<milestone n="58b" unit="section"/>youths and maidens, and saved them and himself.  Now the Athenians made a vow to Apollo, as the story goes, that if they were saved they would send a mission every year to <placeName key="perseus,Delos">Delos</placeName>.  And from that time even to the present day they send it annually in honor of the god.  Now it is their law that after the mission begins the city must be pure and no one may be publicly executed until the ship has gone to <placeName key="perseus,Delos">Delos</placeName> and back;  and sometimes, when contrary winds
<milestone n="58c" unit="section"/>detain it, this takes a long time.  The beginning of the mission is when the priest of Apollo crowns the stern of the ship;  and this took place, as I say, on the day before the trial.  For that reason Socrates passed a long time in prison between his trial and his death.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Echecrates</speaker><p>What took place at his death, Phaedo?  What was said and done?

It is always my greatest pleasure to be reminded of Socrates whether by speaking of him myself or by listening to someone else.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Echecrates</speaker><p>Well, Phaedo, you will have hearers who feel as you do;  so try to tell us everything as accurately as you can.
<milestone n="58e" unit="section"/></p></sp><sp><speaker>Phaedo</speaker><p>For my part, I had strange emotions when I was there.  For I was not filled with pity as I might naturally be when present at the death of a friend;  since he seemed to me to be happy, both in his bearing and his words, he was meeting death so fearlessly and nobly.  And so I thought that even in going to the abode of the dead he was not going without the protection of the gods, and that when he arrived there
<milestone unit="page" n="59"/><milestone n="59a" unit="section"/>it would be well with him, if it ever was well with anyone.  And for this reason I was not at all filled with pity, as might seem natural when I was present at a scene of mourning;  nor on the other hand did I feel pleasure because we were occupied with philosophy, as was our custom&mdash;and our talk was of philosophy;&mdash;but a very strange feeling came over me, an unaccustomed mixture of pleasure and of pain together, when I thought that Socrates was presently to die.  And all of us who were there were in much the same condition, sometimes laughing and sometimes weeping;  especially one of us, Apollodorus;  you know him
<milestone n="59b" unit="section"/>and his character.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Echecrates</speaker><p>To be sure I do.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Phaedo</speaker><p>He was quite unrestrained, and I was much agitated myself, as were the others.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Echecrates</speaker><p>Who were these, Phaedo?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Phaedo</speaker><p>Of native Athenians there was this Apollodorus, and Critobulus and his father, and Hermogenes and Epiganes and Aeschines and Antisthenes;  and Ctesippus the Paeanian was there too, and Menexenus and some other Athenians.

On the previous days
<milestone n="59d" unit="section"/>I and the others had always been in the habit of visiting Socrates.  We used to meet at daybreak in the court where the trial took place, for it was near the prison;  and every day we used to wait about, talking with each other, until the prison was opened, for it was not opened early;  and when it was opened, we went in to Socrates and passed most of the day with him.  On that day we came together earlier;  for the day before,
<milestone n="59e" unit="section"/>when we left the prison in the evening we heard that the ship had arrived from <placeName key="perseus,Delos">Delos</placeName>.  So we agreed to come to the usual place as early in the morning as possible.  And we came, and the jailer who usually answered the door came out and told us to wait and not go in until he told us.  &ldquo;For,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the eleven are releasing Socrates from his fetters and giving directions how he is to die today.&rdquo;  So after a little delay he came and
<milestone unit="page" n="60"/><milestone n="60a" unit="section"/>told us to go in.  We went in then and found Socrates just released from his fetters and Xanthippe&mdash;you know her&mdash;with his little son in her arms, sitting beside him.  Now when Xanthippe saw us, she cried out and said the kind of thing that women always do say:  &ldquo;Oh Socrates, this is the last time now that your friends will speak to you or you to them.&rdquo;  And Socrates glanced at Crito and said, &ldquo;Crito, let somebody take her home.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>And some of Crito's people took her away wailing
<milestone n="60b" unit="section"/>and beating her breast. But Socrates sat up on his couch and bent his leg and rubbed it with his hand, and while he was rubbing it, he said, &ldquo;What a strange thing, my friends, that seems to be which men call pleasure!  How wonderfully it is related to that which seems to be its opposite, pain, in that they will not both come to a man at the same time, and yet if he pursues the one and captures it he is generally obliged to take the other also, as if the two were joined together in one head.  And I think,&rdquo;
<milestone n="60c" unit="section"/>he said, &ldquo;if Aesop had thought of them, he would have made a fable telling how they were at war and god wished to reconcile them, and when he could not do that, he fastened their heads together, and for that reason, when one of them comes to anyone, the other follows after.  Just so it seems that in my case, after pain was in my leg on account of the fetter, pleasure appears to have come following after.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Here Cebes interrupted and said, &ldquo;By Zeus, Socrates, I am glad you reminded me.
<milestone n="60d" unit="section"/>Several others have asked about the poems you have composed, the metrical versions of Aesop's fables and the hymn to Apollo, and Evenus asked me the day before yesterday why you never wrote any poetry before, composed these verses after you came to prison.  Now, if you care that I should be able to answer Evenus when he asks me again&mdash;and I know he will ask me&mdash;tell me what to say.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Then tell him, Cebes,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;the truth, that I composed these verses not because I wished to rival him or his poems,
<milestone n="60e" unit="section"/>for I knew that would not be easy, but because I wished to test the meaning of certain dreams, and to make sure that I was neglecting no duty in case their repeated commands meant that I must cultivate the Muses in this way.  They were something like this.  The same dream came to me often in my past life, sometimes in one form and sometimes in another, but always saying the same thing:  'Socrates,' it said, 'make music and work at it.'  And I formerly thought it was urging and encouraging me
<milestone unit="page" n="61"/><milestone n="61a" unit="section"/>to do what I was doing already and that just as people encourage runners by cheering, so the dream was encouraging me to do what I was doing, that is, to make music, because philosophy was the greatest kind of music and I was working at that.  But now, after the trial and while the festival of the god delayed my execution, I thought, in case the repeated dream really meant to tell me to make this which is ordinarily called music, I ought to do so and not to disobey.  For I thought it was safer not to go hence
<milestone n="61b" unit="section"/>before making sure that I had done what I ought, by obeying the dream and composing verses.  So first I composed a hymn to the god whose festival it was;  and after the god, considering that a poet, if he is really to be a poet, must compose myths and not speeches, since I was not a maker of myths, I took the myths of Aesop, which I had at hand and knew, and turned into verse the first I came upon.  So tell Evenus that, Cebes, and bid him farewell, and tell him, if he is wise, to come after me as quickly as he can.
<milestone n="61c" unit="section"/>I, it seems, am going today;  for that is the order of the Athenians.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>And Simmias said, &ldquo;What a message that is, Socrates, for Evenus!  I have met him often, and from what I have seen of him, I should say that he will not take your advice in the least if he can help it.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Why so?&rdquo; said he.  &ldquo;Is not Evenus a philosopher?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;I think so,&rdquo; said Simmias.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Then Evenus will take my advice, and so will every man who has any worthy interest in philosophy.  Perhaps, however, he will not take his own life, for they say that is not permitted.&rdquo;
<milestone n="61d" unit="section"/>And as he spoke he put his feet down on the ground and remained sitting in this way through the rest of the conversation.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Then Cebes asked him:  &ldquo;What do you mean by this, Socrates, that it is not permitted to take one's life, but that the philosopher would desire to follow after the dying?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;How is this, Cebes?  Have you and Simmias, who are pupils of Philolaus, not heard about such things?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Nothing definite, Socrates.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;I myself speak of them only from hearsay;  but I have no objection to telling what I have heard.  And indeed it is perhaps especially fitting,
<milestone n="61e" unit="section"/>as I am going to the other world, to tell stories about the life there and consider what we think about it;  for what else could one do in the time between now and sunset?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Why in the world do they say that it is not permitted to kill oneself, Socrates? I heard Philolaus, when he was living in our city, say the same thing you just said, and I have heard it from others, too, that one must not do this;  but I never heard anyone say
<milestone unit="page" n="62"/><milestone n="62a" unit="section"/>anything definite about it.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;You must have courage,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and perhaps you might hear something.  But perhaps it will seem strange to you that this alone of all laws is without exception, and it never happens to mankind, as in other matters, that only at some times and for some persons it is better to die than to live;  and it will perhaps seem strange to you that these human beings for whom it is better to die cannot without impiety do good to themselves, but must wait for some other benefactor.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>And Cebes, smiling gently, said, &ldquo;Gawd knows it doos,&rdquo; speaking in his own dialect.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;It would seem unreasonable, if put in this way,&rdquo; said Socrates,
<milestone n="62b" unit="section"/>&ldquo;but perhaps there is some reason in it.  Now the doctrine that is taught in secret about this matter, that we men are in a kind of prison and must not set ourselves free or run away, seems to me to be weighty and not easy to understand.  But this at least, Cebes, I do believe is sound, that the gods are our guardians and that we men are one of the chattels of the gods.  Do you not believe this?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Cebes,
<milestone n="62c" unit="section"/>&ldquo;I do.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Well then,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;if one of your chattels should kill itself when you had not indicated that you wished it to die, would you be angry with it and punish it if you could?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; he replied.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Then perhaps from this point of view it is not unreasonable to say that a man must not kill himself until god sends some necessity upon him, such as has now come upon me.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said Cebes, &ldquo;seems sensible.  But what you said just now, Socrates, that philosophers ought to be ready and willing to die, that seems
<milestone n="62d" unit="section"/>strange if we were right just now in saying that god is our guardian and we are his possessions.  For it is not reasonable that the wisest men should not be troubled when they leave that service in which the gods, who are the best overseers in the world, are watching over them.  A wise man certainly does not think that when he is free he can take better care of himself than they do.  A foolish man might perhaps think so, that he ought to run away from his master,
<milestone n="62e" unit="section"/>and he would not consider that he must not run away from a good master, but ought to stay with him as long as possible;  and so he might thoughtlessly run away;  but a man of sense would wish to be always with one who is better than himself.  And yet, Socrates, if we look at it in this way, the contrary of what we just said seems natural;  for the wise ought to be troubled at dying and the foolish to rejoice.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>When Socrates heard this
<milestone unit="page" n="63"/><milestone n="63a" unit="section"/>I thought he was pleased by Cebes' earnestness, and glancing at us, he said, &ldquo;Cebes is always on the track of arguments and will not be easily convinced by whatever anyone says.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>And Simmias said, &ldquo;Well, Socrates, this time I think myself that Cebes is right.  For why should really wise men run away from masters who are better than they and lightly separate themselves from them?  And it strikes me that Cebes is aiming his argument at you, because you are so ready to leave us and the gods, who are, as
<milestone n="63b" unit="section"/>you yourself agree, good rulers.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;You have a right to say that,&rdquo; he replied;  &ldquo;for I think you mean that I must defend myself against this accusation, as if we were in a law court.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Precisely,&rdquo; said Simmias.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I will try to make a more convincing defence than I did before the judges.  For if I did not believe,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that I was going to other wise and good gods, and, moreover, to men who have died, better men than those here, I should be wrong in not grieving at death.  But as it is, you may rest assured
<milestone n="63c" unit="section"/>that I expect to go to good men, though I should not care to assert this positively;  but I would assert as positively as anything about such matters that I am going to gods who are good masters.  And therefore, so far as that is concerned, I not only do not grieve, but I have great hopes that there is something in store for the dead, and, as has been said of old, something better for the good than for the wicked.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Simmias, &ldquo;do you intend to go away, Socrates,
<milestone n="63d" unit="section"/>and keep your opinion to yourself, or would you let us share it?  It seems to me that this is a good which belongs in common to us also, and at the same time, if you convince us by what you say, that will serve as your defence.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;I will try,&rdquo; he replied.  &ldquo;But first let us ask Crito there what he wants.  He has apparently been trying to say something for a long time.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Only, Socrates,&rdquo; said Crito, &ldquo;that the man who is to administer the poison to you has been telling me for some time to warn you to talk as little as possible.  He says people get warm when they talk and heat has a bad effect on the action of the poison;
<milestone n="63e" unit="section"/>so sometimes he has to make those who talk too much drink twice or even three times.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>And Socrates said:  &ldquo;Never mind him.  Just let him do his part and prepare to give it twice or even, if necessary, three times.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;I was pretty sure that was what you would say,&rdquo; said Crito, &ldquo;but he has been bothering me for a long time.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Never mind him,&rdquo; said Socrates.  &ldquo;I wish now to explain to you, my judges, the reason why I think a man who has really spent his life in philosophy is naturally of good courage
<milestone unit="page" n="64"/><milestone n="64a" unit="section"/>when he is to die, and has strong hopes that when he is dead he will attain the greatest blessings in that other land.  So I will try to tell you, Simmias, and Cebes, how this would be.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Other people are likely not to be aware that those who pursue philosophy aright study nothing but dying and being dead.  Now if this is true, it would be absurd to be eager for nothing but this all their lives, and then to be troubled when that came for which they had all along been eagerly practicing.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>And Simmias laughed and said, &ldquo;By Zeus,
<milestone n="64b" unit="section"/>Socrates, I don't feel much like laughing just now, but you made me laugh.  For I think the multitude, if they heard what you just said about the philosophers, would say you were quite right, and our people at home would agree entirely with you that philosophers desire death, and they would add that they know very well that the philosophers deserve it.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;And they would be speaking the truth, Simmias, except in the matter of knowing very well.  For they do not know in what way the real philosophers desire death, nor in what way they deserve death, nor what kind of a death it is.
<milestone n="64c" unit="section"/>Let us then,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;speak with one another, paying no further attention to them.  Do we think there is such a thing as death?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; replied Simmias.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;We believe, do we not, that death is the separation of the soul from the body, and that the state of being dead is the state in which the body is separated from the soul and exists alone by itself and the soul is separated from the body and exists alone by itself?  Is death anything other than this?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;No, it is this,&rdquo; said he.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Now, my friend, see if you agree with me;
<milestone n="64d" unit="section"/>for, if you do, I think we shall get more light on our subject.  Do you think a philosopher would be likely to care much about the so-called pleasures, such as eating and drinking?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;By no means, Socrates,&rdquo; said Simmias.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;How about the pleasures of love?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Certainly not.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Well, do you think such a man would think much of the other cares of the body&mdash;I mean such as the possession of fine clothes and shoes and the other personal adornments?  Do you think he would care about them
<milestone n="64e" unit="section"/>or despise them, except so far as it is necessary to have them?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;I think the true philosopher would despise them,&rdquo; he replied.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Altogether, then, you think that such a man would not devote himself to the body, but would, so far as he was able, turn away from the body and concern himself with the soul?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;To begin with, then, it is clear that in such matters the philosopher, more than other men, separates
<milestone unit="page" n="65"/><milestone n="65a" unit="section"/>the soul from communion with the body?&rdquo; <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;It is.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Now certainly most people think that a man who takes no pleasure and has no part in such things doesn't deserve to live, and that one who cares nothing for the pleasures of the body is about as good as dead.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;That is very true.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Now, how about the acquirement of pure knowledge? Is the body a hindrance or not, if it is made to share in the search for wisdom?
<milestone n="65b" unit="section"/>What I mean is this:  Have the sight and hearing of men any truth in them, or is it true, as the poets are always telling us, that we neither hear nor see any thing accurately? And yet if these two physical senses are not accurate or exact, the rest are not likely to be, for they are inferior to these.  Do you not think so?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Certainly I do,&rdquo; he replied.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;when does the soul attain to truth?  For when it tries to consider anything in company with the body, it is evidently deceived by it.&rdquo;
<milestone n="65c" unit="section"/>&ldquo;True.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;In thought, then, if at all, something of the realities becomes clear to it?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/> &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/> &ldquo;But it thinks best when none of these things troubles it, neither hearing nor sight, nor pain nor any pleasure, but it is, so far as possible, alone by itself, and takes leave of the body, and avoiding, so far as it can, all association or contact with the body, reaches out toward the reality.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;That is true.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;In this matter also, then,
<milestone n="65d" unit="section"/>the soul of the philosopher greatly despises the body and avoids it and strives to be alone by itself?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Evidently.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Now how about such things as this, Simmias?  Do we think there is such a thing as absolute justice, or not?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;We certainly think there is.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;And absolute beauty and goodness.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Well, did you ever see anything of that kind with your eyes?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; said he.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Or did you ever reach them with any of the bodily senses?  I am speaking of all such things, as size, health, strength, and in short the essence
<milestone n="65e" unit="section"/>or underlying quality of everything.  Is their true nature contemplated by means of the body?  Is it not rather the case that he who prepares himself most carefully to understand the true essence of each thing that he examines would come nearest to the knowledge of it?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Would not that man do this most perfectly who approaches each thing, so far as possible, with the reason alone, not introducing sight into his reasoning nor dragging in
<milestone unit="page" n="66"/><milestone n="66a" unit="section"/>any of the other senses along with his thinking, but who employs pure, absolute reason in his attempt to search out the pure, absolute essence of things, and who removes himself, so far as possible, from eyes and ears, and, in a word, from his whole body, because he feels that its companionship disturbs the soul and hinders it from attaining truth and wisdom?  Is not this the man, Simmias, if anyone, to attain to the knowledge of reality?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;That is true as true can be, Socrates,&rdquo; said Simmias.
<milestone n="66b" unit="section"/>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;all this must cause good lovers of wisdom to think and say one to the other something like this:  'There seems to be a short cut which leads us and our argument to the conclusion in our search that so long as we have the body, and the soul is contaminated by such an evil, we shall never attain completely what we desire, that is, the truth.  For the body keeps us constantly busy by reason of its need of sustenance;
<milestone n="66c" unit="section"/>and moreover, if diseases come upon it they hinder our pursuit of the truth.  And the body fills us with passions and desires and fears, and all sorts of fancies and foolishness, so that, as they say, it really and truly makes it impossible for us to think at all.  The body and its desires are the only cause of wars and factions and battles;  for all wars arise for the sake of gaining money, and we are compelled to gain money
<milestone n="66d" unit="section"/>for the sake of the body.  We are slaves to its service.  And so, because of all these things, we have no leisure for philosophy.  But the worst of all is that if we do get a bit of leisure and turn to philosophy, the body is constantly breaking in upon our studies and disturbing us with noise and confusion, so that it prevents our beholding the truth, and in fact we perceive that, if we are ever to know anything absolutely, we must be free from the body and must behold
<milestone n="66e" unit="section"/>the actual realities with the eye of the soul alone.  And then, as our argument shows, when we are dead we are likely to possess the wisdom which we desire and claim to be enamored of, but not while we live.  For, if pure knowledge is impossible while the body is with us, one of two thing must follow, either it cannot be acquired at all or only when we are dead;  for then the soul
<milestone unit="page" n="67"/><milestone n="67a" unit="section"/>will be by itself apart from the  body, but not before.  And while we live, we shall, I think, be nearest to knowledge when we avoid, so far as possible, intercourse and communion with the body, except what is absolutely necessary, and are not filled with its nature, but keep ourselves pure from it until God himself sets us free.  And in this way, freeing ourselves from the foolishness of the body and being pure, we shall, I think, be with the pure and shall know of ourselves all that is pure,&mdash;
<milestone n="67b" unit="section"/>and that is, perhaps, the truth.  For it cannot be that the impure attain the pure.'  Such words as these,  I think, Simmias, all who are rightly lovers of knowledge must say to each other and such must be their thoughts.  Do you not agree?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Most assuredly, Socrates.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Socrates, &ldquo;if this is true, my friend, I have great hopes that when I reach the place to which I am going, I shall there, if anywhere, attain fully to that which has been my chief object in my past life, so that the journey which is now
<milestone n="67c" unit="section"/>imposed upon me is begun with good hope;  and the like hope exists for every man who thinks that his mind has been purified and made ready.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said Simmias.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;And does not the purification consist in this which has been mentioned long ago in our discourse, in separating, so far as possible, the soul from the body and teaching the soul the habit of collecting and bringing itself together from all parts of the body, and living, so far as it can, both now
<milestone n="67d" unit="section"/>and hereafter, alone by itself, freed from the body as from fetters?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said he.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Well, then, this is what we call death, is it not, a release and separation from the body?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Exactly so,&rdquo; said he.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;But, as we hold, the true philosophers and they alone are always most eager to release the soul, and just this&mdash;the release and separation of the soul from the body&mdash;is their study, is it not?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Obviously.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Then, as I said in the beginning, it would be absurd if a man who had been all his life fitting himself to live as nearly
<milestone n="67e" unit="section"/>in a state of death as he could, should then be disturbed when death came to him.  Would it not be absurd?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;In fact, then, Simmias,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;the true philosophers practice dying, and death is less terrible to them than to any other men.  Consider it in this way.  They are in every way hostile to the body and they desire to have the soul apart by itself alone.  Would it not be very foolish if they should be frightened and troubled when this very thing happens, and if they should not be glad to go to the place where there is hope of attaining
<milestone unit="page" n="68"/><milestone n="68a" unit="section"/>what they longed for all through life&mdash;and they longed for wisdom&mdash;and of escaping from the companionship of that which they hated?  When human loves or wives or sons have died, many men have willingly gone to the other world led by the hope of seeing there those whom they longed for, and of being with them;  and shall he who is really in love with wisdom and has a firm belief that he can find it nowhere else
<milestone n="68b" unit="section"/>than in the other world grieve when he dies and not be glad to go there?  We cannot think that, my friend, if he is really a philosopher;  for he will confidently believe that he will find pure wisdom nowhere else than in the other world.  And if this is so, would it not be very foolish for such a man to fear death?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Very foolish, certainly,&rdquo; said he.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Then is it not,&rdquo; said Socrates, &ldquo;a sufficient indication, when you see a man troubled because he is going to die, that he was not a lover of wisdom but a lover of the body?
<milestone n="68c" unit="section"/>And this same man is also a lover of money and of honor, one or both.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;it is as you say.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Then, Simmias,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;is not that which is called courage especially characteristic of philosophers?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;By all means,&rdquo; said he.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;And self-restraint&mdash;that which is commonly called self-restraint, which consists in not being excited by the passions and in being superior to them and acting in a seemly way&mdash;is not that characteristic of those alone who despise the body
<milestone n="68d" unit="section"/>and pass their lives in philosophy?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Necessarily,&rdquo; said he.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;For,&rdquo; said Socrates, &ldquo;if you care to consider the courage and the self-restraint of other men, you will see that they are absurd.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;How so, Socrates?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;You know, do you not, that all other men count death among the great evils?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;They certainly do.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;And do not brave men face death&mdash;when they do face it&mdash;through fear of greater evils?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;That is true.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Then all except philosophers are brave through fear.  And yet it is absurd to be brave through fear and cowardice.&rdquo;
<milestone n="68e" unit="section"/>&ldquo;Very true.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;And how about those of seemly conduct?  Is their case not the same?  They are self-restrained because of a kind of self-indulgence.  We say, to be sure, that this is impossible, nevertheless their foolish self-restraint amounts to little more than this;  for they fear that they may be deprived of certain pleasures which they desire, and so they refrain from some because they are under the sway of others.  And yet being ruled by pleasures
<milestone unit="page" n="69"/><milestone n="69a" unit="section"/>is called self-indulgence.  Nevertheless they conquer pleasures because they are conquered by other pleasures.  Now this is about what I said just now, that they are self-restrained by a kind of self-indulgence.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;So it seems.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;My dear Simmias, I suspect that this is not the right way to purchase virtue, by exchanging pleasures for pleasures, and pains for pains, and fear for fear, and greater for less, as if they were coins, but the only right coinage, for which all those things
<milestone n="69b" unit="section"/>must be exchanged and by means of and with which all these things are to be bought and sold, is in fact wisdom;  and courage and self-restraint and justice and, in short, true virtue exist only with wisdom, whether pleasures and fears and other things of that sort are added or taken away.  And virtue which consists in the exchange of such things for each other without wisdom, is but a painted imitation of virtue and is really slavish and has nothing healthy or true in it;  but truth is in fact a purification
<milestone n="69c" unit="section"/>from all these things, and self-restraint and justice and courage and wisdom itself are a kind of purification.  And I fancy that those men who established the mysteries were not unenlightened, but in reality had a hidden meaning when they said long ago that whoever goes uninitiated and unsanctified to the other world will lie in the mire, but he who arrives there initiated and purified will dwell with the gods.  For as they say in the mysteries, 'the thyrsus-bearers are many, but the mystics few';
<milestone n="69d" unit="section"/>and these mystics are, I believe, those who have been true philosophers.  And I in my life have, so far as I could, left nothing undone, and have striven in every way to make myself one of them.  But whether I have striven aright and have met with success, I believe I shall know clearly, when I have arrived there, very soon, if it is God's will.  This then, Simmias and Cebes, is the defence I offer to show that it is reasonable for me not to be grieved or troubled at leaving you and the rulers I have here,
<milestone n="69e" unit="section"/>because I believe that there, no less than here, I shall find good rulers and friends.  If now I am more successful in convincing you by my defence than I was in convincing my Athenian judges, it is well.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>When Socrates had finished, Cebes answered and said:  &ldquo;Socrates, I agree to
<milestone unit="page" n="70"/><milestone n="70a" unit="section"/>the other things you say, but in regard to the soul men are very prone to disbelief.  They fear that when the soul leaves the body it no longer exists anywhere, and that on the day when the man dies it is destroyed and perishes, and when it leaves the body and departs from it, straightway it flies away and is no longer anywhere, scattering like a breath or smoke.  If it exists anywhere by itself as a unit, freed from these evils which you have enumerated just now,
<milestone n="70b" unit="section"/>there would be good reason for the blessed hope, Socrates, that what you say is true.  But perhaps no little argument and proof is required to show that when a man is dead the soul still exists and has any power and intelligence.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;What you say, Cebes, is true,&rdquo; said Socrates.  &ldquo;Now what shall we do?  Do you wish to keep on conversing about this to see whether it is probable or not?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; said Cebes.  &ldquo;I should like to hear what you think about it.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Socrates, &ldquo;I do not believe anyone who heard us now,
<milestone n="70c" unit="section"/>even if he were a comic poet, would say that I am chattering and talking about things which do not concern me.  So if you like, let us examine the matter to the end.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Let us consider it by asking whether the souls of men who have died are in the nether world or not.  There is an ancient tradition, which we remember, that they go there from here and come back here again and are born from the dead.  Now if this is true, if the living are born again from the dead, our souls would exist there,
<milestone n="70d" unit="section"/>would they not?  For they could not be born again if they did not exist, and this would be a sufficient proof that they exist, if it should really be made evident that the living are born only from the dead.  But if this is not so then some other argument would be needed.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said Cebes.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;if you wish to find this out easily, do not consider the question with regard to men only, but with regard to all animals and plants, and, in short, to all things which may be said to have birth.  Let us see with regard to all these, whether it is true that they are all born or generated
<milestone n="70e" unit="section"/>only from their opposites, in case they have opposites, as for instance, the noble is the opposite of the disgraceful, the just of the unjust, and there are countless other similar pairs.  Let us consider the question whether it is inevitable that everything which has an opposite be generated from its opposite and from it only.  For instance, when anything becomes greater it must inevitably have been smaller and then have become greater.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;And if it becomes smaller,
<milestone unit="page" n="71"/><milestone n="71a" unit="section"/>it must have been greater and then have become smaller?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; said he.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;And the weaker is generated from the stronger, and the slower from the quicker?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;And the worse from the better and the more just from the more unjust?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;we have this fact sufficiently established, that all things are generated in this way, opposites from opposites?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Now then, is there between all these pairs of opposites what may be called
<milestone n="71b" unit="section"/>two kinds of generation, from one to the other and back again from the other to the first?  Between a larger thing and a smaller thing there is increment and diminution and we call one increasing and the other decreasing, do we not?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said he.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;And similarly analyzing and combining, and cooling and heating, and all opposites in the same way.  Even if we do not in every case have the words to express it, yet in fact is it not always inevitable that there is a process of generation from each to the other?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said he.
<milestone n="71c" unit="section"/>&ldquo;Well then,&rdquo; said Socrates, &ldquo;is there anything that is the opposite of living, as being awake is the opposite of sleeping?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said Cebes.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Being dead,&rdquo; said he.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Then these two are generated from each other, and as they are two, so the processes between them are two;  is it not so?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Socrates, &ldquo;I will tell about one of the two pairs of which I just spoke to you and its intermediate processes;  and do you tell me about the other.  I say one term is sleeping and the other is being awake, and being awake is generated from sleeping, and sleeping from being awake,
<milestone n="71d" unit="section"/>and the processes of generation are, in the latter case, falling asleep, and in the former, waking up.  Do you agree, or not?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Now do you,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;tell me in this way about life and death.  Do you not say that living is the opposite of being dead?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;I do.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;And that they are generated one from the other?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Now what is it which is generated from the living?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;The dead,&rdquo; said he.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;And what,&rdquo; said Socrates, &ldquo;from the dead?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;I can say only one thing&mdash;the living.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;From the dead, then, Cebes, the living, both things and persons,
<milestone n="71e" unit="section"/>are generated?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Evidently,&rdquo; said he.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Socrates, &ldquo;our souls exist in the other world.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;So it seems.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;And of the two processes of generation between these two, the one is plain to be seen;  for surely dying is plain to be seen, is it not?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said he.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Well then,&rdquo; said Socrates, &ldquo;what shall we do next?  Shall we deny the opposite process, and shall nature be one-sided in this instance?  Or must we grant that there is some process of generation the opposite of dying?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Certainly we must,&rdquo; said he.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;What is this process?''<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Coming to life again.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Socrates, &ldquo;if there be such a thing as
<milestone unit="page" n="72"/><milestone n="72a" unit="section"/>coming to life again, this would be the process of generation from the dead to the living?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;So by this method also we reach the conclusion that the living are generated from the dead, just as much as the dead from the living;  and since this is the case, it seems to me to be a sufficient proof that the souls of the dead exist somewhere, whence they come back to life.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;I think, Socrates, that results necessarily from our previous admissions.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Now here is another method, Cebes, to prove, as it seems to me, that we were right in making those admissions.
<milestone n="72b" unit="section"/>For if generation did not proceed from opposite to opposite and back again, going round, as it were in a circle, but always went forward in a straight line without turning back or curving, then, you know, in the end all things would have the same form and be acted upon in the same way and stop being generated at all.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; said he.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;It is not at all hard,&rdquo; said Socrates, &ldquo;to understand what I mean.  For example, if the process of falling asleep existed, but not the opposite process of waking from sleep,
<milestone n="72c" unit="section"/>in the end, you know, that would make the sleeping Endymion mere nonsense;  he would be nowhere, for everything else would be in the same state as he, sound asleep.  Or if all thing were mixed together and never separated, the saying of Anaxagoras, all things are chaos, would soon come true.  And in like manner, my dear Cebes, if all things that have life should die, and, when they had died, the dead should remain in that condition, is it not inevitable that at last all things would be dead
<milestone n="72d" unit="section"/>and nothing alive? For if the living were generated from any other things than from the dead, and the living were to die, is there any escape from the final result that all things would be swallowed up in death?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;I see none, Socrates,&rdquo; said Cebes.  &ldquo;What you say seems to be perfectly true.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;I think, Cebes,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;it is absolutely so, and we are not deluded in making these admissions, but the return to life is an actual fact, and it is a fact that the living are generated from the dead and that the souls of the dead
<milestone n="72e" unit="section"/>exist.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;And besides,&rdquo; Cebes rejoined, &ldquo;if it is true, Socrates, as you are fond of saying, that our learning is nothing else than recollection, then this would be an additional argument that we must necessarily have learned in some previous time what we now remember.  But this is impossible if
<milestone unit="page" n="73"/><milestone n="73a" unit="section"/>our soul did not exist somewhere before being born in this human form;  and so by this argument also it appears that the soul is immortal.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;But, Cebes,&rdquo; said Simmias, &ldquo;what were the proofs of this?  Remind me;  for I do not recollect very well just now.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Briefly,&rdquo; said Cebes, &ldquo;a very good proof is this:  When people are questioned, if you put the questions well, they answer correctly of themselves about everything;  and yet if they had not within them some knowledge and right reason, they could not do this.  And that this is so is shown most clearly if you take them
<milestone n="73b" unit="section"/>to mathematical diagrams or anything of that sort.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;And if you are not convinced in that way, Simmias,&rdquo; said Socrates, &ldquo;see if you don't agree when you look at it in this way.  You are incredulous, are you not, how that which is called learning can be recollection?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;I am not incredulous,&rdquo; said Simmias, &ldquo;but I want just what we are talking about, recollection.  And from what Cebes undertook to say I already begin to recollect and be convinced;  nevertheless, I should like to hear
<milestone n="73c" unit="section"/>what you were going to say.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;It was this,&rdquo; said he.  &ldquo;We agree, I suppose, that if anyone is to remember anything, he must know it at some previous time?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said he.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Then do we agree to this also, that when knowledge comes in such a way, it is recollection?  What I mean is this:  If a man, when he has heard or seen or in any other way perceived a thing, knows not only that thing, but also has a perception of some other thing, the knowledge of which is not the same, but different, are we not right in saying that
<milestone n="73d" unit="section"/>he recollects the thing of which he has the perception?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Let me give an example.  Knowledge of a man is different from knowledge of a lyre.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Well, you know that a lover when he sees a lyre or a cloak or anything else which his beloved is wont to use, perceives the lyre and in his mind receives an image of the boy to whom the lyre belongs, do you not?  But this is recollection, just as when one sees Simmias, one often remembers Cebes, and I could cite countless such examples.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;To be sure you could,&rdquo; said Simmias.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said he,
<milestone n="73e" unit="section"/>&ldquo;is that sort of thing a kind of recollection? Especially when it takes place with regard to things which have already been forgotten through time and inattention?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; he replied.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; said Socrates, &ldquo;can a person on seeing a picture of a horse or of a lyre be reminded of a man, or on seeing a picture of Simmias be reminded of Cebes?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Surely.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;And on seeing a picture of Simmias he can be reminded
<milestone unit="page" n="74"/><milestone n="74a" unit="section"/>of Simmias himself?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said he.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;All these examples show, then, that recollection is caused by like things and also by unlike things, do they not?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;And when one has a recollection of anything caused by like things, will he not also inevitably consider whether this recollection offers a perfect likeness of the thing recollected, or not?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Inevitably,&rdquo; he replied.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Now see,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;if this is true.  We say there is such a thing as equality.  I do not mean one piece of wood equal to another, or one stone to another, or anything of that sort, but something beyond that&mdash;equality in the abstract.  Shall we say there is such a thing, or not?&rdquo;
<milestone n="74b" unit="section"/>&ldquo;We shall say that there is,&rdquo; said Simmias, &ldquo;most decidedly.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;And do we know what it is?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said he.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Whence did we derive the knowledge of it?  Is it not from the things we were just speaking of?  Did we not, by seeing equal pieces of wood or stones or other things, derive from them a knowledge of abstract equality, which is another thing? Or do you not think it is another thing?  Look at the matter in this way.  Do not equal stones and pieces of wood, though they remain the same, sometimes appear to us equal in one respect and unequal in another?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Well, then, did absolute equals ever appear to you unequal or
<milestone n="74c" unit="section"/>equality inequality?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;No, Socrates, never.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;those equals are not the same as equality in the abstract.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Not at all, I should say, Socrates.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;But from those equals,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;which are not the same as abstract equality, you have nevertheless conceived and acquired knowledge of it?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Very true,&rdquo; he replied.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;And it is either like them or unlike them?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;It makes no difference,&rdquo; said he.  &ldquo;Whenever the sight of one thing
<milestone n="74d" unit="section"/>brings you a perception of another, whether they be like or unlike, that must necessarily be recollection.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Surely.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Now then,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;do the equal pieces of wood and the equal things of which we were speaking just now affect us in this way:  Do they seem to us to be equal as abstract equality is equal, or do they somehow fall short of being like abstract equality?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;They fall very far short of it,&rdquo; said he.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Do we agree, then, that when anyone on seeing a thing thinks, 'This thing that I see aims at being like some other thing that exists, but falls short
<milestone n="74e" unit="section"/>and is unable to be like that thing, but is inferior to it, he who thinks thus must of necessity have previous knowledge of the thing which he says the other resembles but falls short of?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;We must.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Well then, is this just what happened to us with regard to the equal things and equality in the abstract?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;It certainly is.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Then we must have had knowledge of equality
<milestone unit="page" n="75"/><milestone n="75a" unit="section"/>before the time when we first saw equal things and thought, &lsquo;All these things are aiming to be like equality but fall short.&rsquo;&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;That is true.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;And we agree, also, that we have not gained knowledge of it, and that it is impossible to gain this knowledge, except by sight or touch or some other of the senses?  I consider that all the senses are alike.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Yes, Socrates, they are all alike, for the purposes of our argument.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Then it is through the senses that we must learn
<milestone n="75b" unit="section"/>that all sensible objects strive after absolute equality and fall short of it.  Is that our view?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Then before we began to see or hear or use the other senses we must somewhere have gained a knowledge of abstract or absolute equality, if we were to compare with it the equals which we perceive by the senses, and see that all such things yearn to be like abstract equality but fall short of it.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;That follows necessarily from what we have said before, Socrates.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;And we saw and heard and had the other senses as soon as we were born?&rdquo;
<milestone n="75c" unit="section"/>&ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;But, we say, we must have acquired a knowledge of equality before we had these senses?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Yes.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Then it appears that we must have acquired it before we were born.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;It does.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Now if we had acquired that knowledge before we were born, and were born with it, we knew before we were born and at the moment of birth not only the equal and the greater and the less, but all such abstractions? For our present argument is no more concerned with the equal than with absolute beauty and the absolute good and the just and the holy, and, in short,
<milestone n="75d" unit="section"/>with all those things which we stamp with the seal of absolute in our dialectic process of questions and answers;  so that we must necessarily have acquired knowledge of all these before our birth.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;That is true.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;And if after acquiring it we have not, in each case, forgotten it, we must always be born knowing these things, and must know them throughout our life;  for to know is to have acquired knowledge and to have retained it without losing it, and the loss of knowledge is just what we mean when we speak of forgetting, is it not, Simmias?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Certainly,
<milestone n="75e" unit="section"/>Socrates,&rdquo; said he.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;But, I suppose, if we acquired knowledge before we were born and lost it at birth, but afterwards by the use of our senses regained the knowledge which we had previously possessed, would not the process which we call learning really be recovering knowledge which is our own? And should we be right in calling this recollection?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Assuredly.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;For we found that it is possible,
<milestone unit="page" n="76"/><milestone n="76a" unit="section"/>on perceiving a thing by the sight or the hearing or any other sense, to call to mind from that perception another thing which had been forgotten, which was associated with the thing perceived, whether like it or unlike it;  so that, as I said, one of two things is true, either we are all born knowing these things and know them all our lives, or afterwards, those who are said to learn merely remember, and learning would then be recollection.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;That is certainly true, Socrates.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Which then do you choose, Simmias?  Were we born
<milestone n="76b" unit="section"/>with the knowledge, or do we recollect afterwards things of which we had acquired knowledge before our birth?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;I cannot choose at this moment, Socrates.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;How about this question?  You can choose and you have some opinion about it:  When a man knows, can he give an account of what he knows or not?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Certainly he can, Socrates.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;And do you think that everybody can give an account of the matters about which we have just been talking?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;I wish they might,&rdquo; said Simmias;  &ldquo;but on the contrary I fear that tomorrow, at this time, there will be no longer any man living who is able to do so properly.&rdquo;
<milestone n="76c" unit="section"/>&ldquo;Then, Simmias, you do not think all men know these things?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;By no means.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Then they recollect the things they once learned?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Necessarily.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;When did our souls acquire the knowledge of them?  Surely not after we were born as human beings.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Certainly not.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Then previously.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Then, Simmias, the souls existed previously, before they were in human form, apart from bodies, and they had intelligence.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Unless, Socrates, we acquire these ideas at the moment of birth;  for that time
<milestone n="76d" unit="section"/>still remains.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Very well, my friend.  But at what other time do we lose them?  For we are surely not born with them, as we just now agreed.  Do we lose them at the moment when we receive them, or have you some other time to suggest?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;None whatever, Socrates.  I did not notice that I was talking nonsense.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Then, Simmias,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;is this the state of the case?  If, as we are always saying, the beautiful exists, and the good, and every essence of that kind, and if we refer all our sensations to these,
<milestone n="76e" unit="section"/>which we find existed previously and are now ours, and compare our sensations with these, is it not a necessary inference that just as these abstractions exist, so our souls existed before we were born;  and if these abstractions do not exist, our argument is of no force?  Is this the case, and is it equally certain that provided these things exist our souls also existed before we were born, and that if these do not exist, neither did our souls?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Socrates, it seems to me that there is absolutely the same certainty, and our argument comes to the excellent conclusion that
<milestone unit="page" n="77"/><milestone n="77a" unit="section"/>our soul existed before we were born, and that the essence of which you speak likewise exists.  For there is nothing so clear to me as this, that all such things, the beautiful, the good, and all the others of which you were speaking just now, have a most real existence.  And I think the proof is sufficient.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;But how about Cebes?&rdquo; said Socrates.  &ldquo;For Cebes must be convinced, too.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;He is fully convinced, I think,&rdquo; said Simmias;  &ldquo;and yet he is the most obstinately incredulous of mortals.  Still, I believe he is quite convinced of this, that our soul existed
<milestone n="77b" unit="section"/>before we were born.  However, that it will still exist after we die does not seem even to me to have been proved, Socrates, but the common fear, which Cebes mentioned just now, that when a man dies the soul is dispersed and this is the end of his existence, still remains.  For assuming that the soul comes into being and is brought together from some source or other and exists before it enters into a human body, what prevents it, after it has entered into and left that body, from coming to an end and being destroyed itself?&rdquo;
<milestone n="77c" unit="section"/>&ldquo;You are right, Simmias,&rdquo; said Cebes.  &ldquo;It seems to me that we have proved only half of what is required, namely, that our soul existed before our birth.  But we must also show that it exists after we are dead as well as before our birth, if the proof is to be perfect.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;It has been shown, Simmias and Cebes, already,&rdquo; said Socrates, &ldquo;if you will combine this conclusion with the one we reached before, that every living being is born from the dead.  For if the soul exists before birth, and,
<milestone n="77d" unit="section"/>when it comes into life and is born, cannot be born from anything else than death and a state of death, must it not also exist after dying, since it must be born again?  So the proof you call for has already been given.  However, I think you and Simmias would like to carry on this discussion still further.  You have the childish fear that when the soul goes out from the body the wind will really blow it away and scatter it, especially
<milestone n="77e" unit="section"/>if a man happens to die in a high wind and not in calm weather.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>And Cebes laughed and said, &ldquo;Assume that we have that fear, Socrates, and try to convince us;  or rather, do not assume that we are afraid, but perhaps there is a child within us, who has such fears.  Let us try to persuade him not to fear death as if it were a hobgoblin.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Socrates, &ldquo;you must sing charms to him every day until you charm away his fear.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="page" n="78"/><milestone n="78a" unit="section"/>&ldquo;Where then, Socrates,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;shall we find a good singer of such charms, since you are leaving us?''<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;<placeName key="tgn,1000074">Hellas</placeName>, Cebes,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;is a large country, in which there are many good men, and there are many foreign peoples also.  You ought to search through all of them in quest of such a charmer, sparing neither money nor toil, for there is no greater need for which you could spend your money.  And you must seek among yourselves, too, for perhaps you would hardly find others better able to do this than you.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said Cebes, &ldquo;shall be done.  But let us return to the point where we left off,
<milestone n="78b" unit="section"/>if you are willing.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Oh, I am willing, of course.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said he.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Well then,&rdquo; said Socrates, &ldquo;must we not ask ourselves some such question as this?  What kind of thing naturally suffers dispersion, and for what kind of thing might we naturally fear it, and again what kind of thing is not liable to it?  And after this must we not inquire to which class the soul belongs and base our hopes or fears for our souls upon the answers to these questions?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;You are quite right,&rdquo; he replied.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Now is not that which is compounded
<milestone n="78c" unit="section"/>and composite naturally liable to be decomposed, in the same way in which it was compounded?  And if anything is uncompounded is not that, if anything, naturally unlikely to be decomposed?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said Cebes, &ldquo;that is true.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Then it is most probable that things which are always the same and unchanging are the uncompounded things and the things that are changing and never the same are the composite things?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Yes, I think so.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Let us then,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;turn to what we were discussing before.
<milestone n="78d" unit="section"/>Is the absolute essence, which we in our dialectic process of question and answer call true being, always the same or is it liable to change?  Absolute equality, absolute beauty, any absolute existence, true being&mdash;do they ever admit of any change whatsoever?  Or does each absolute essence, since it is uniform and exists by itself, remain the same and never in any way admit of any change?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;It must,&rdquo; said Cebes, &ldquo;necessarily remain the same,
<milestone n="78e" unit="section"/>Socrates.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;But how about the many things, for example, men, or horses, or cloaks, or any other such things, which bear the same names as the absolute essences and are called beautiful or equal or the like?  Are they always the same?  Or are they, in direct opposition to the essences, constantly changing in themselves, unlike each other, and, so to speak, never the same?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;The latter,&rdquo; said Cebes;  &ldquo;they are never the same.&rdquo;
<milestone unit="page" n="79"/><milestone n="79a" unit="section"/>&ldquo;And you can see these and touch them and perceive them by the other senses, whereas the things which are always the same can be grasped only by the reason, and are invisible and not to be seen?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that is true.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;shall we assume two kinds of existences, one visible, the other invisible?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Let us assume them,&rdquo; said Cebes.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;And that the invisible is always the same and the visible constantly changing?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Let us assume that also,&rdquo; said he.
<milestone n="79b" unit="section"/>&ldquo;Well then,&rdquo; said Socrates, &ldquo;are we not made up of two parts, body and soul?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he replied.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Now to which class should we say the body is more similar and more closely akin?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;To the visible,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;that is clear to everyone.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;And the soul?  Is it visible or invisible?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Invisible, to man, at least, Socrates.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;But we call things visible and invisible with reference to human vision, do we not?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Yes, we do.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Then what do we say about the soul?  Can it be seen or not?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;It cannot be seen.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Then it is invisible?&rdquo; <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Then the soul is more like the invisible than the body is,
<milestone n="79c" unit="section"/>and the body more like the visible.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Necessarily, Socrates.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Now we have also been saying for a long time, have we not, that, when the soul makes use of the body for any inquiry, either through seeing or hearing or any of the other senses&mdash;for inquiry through the body means inquiry through the senses,&mdash;then it is dragged by the body to things which never remain the same, and it wanders about and is confused and dizzy like a drunken man because it lays hold upon such things?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;But when the soul
<milestone n="79d" unit="section"/>inquires alone by itself, it departs into the realm of the pure, the everlasting, the immortal and the changeless, and being akin to these it dwells always with them whenever it is by itself and is not hindered, and it has rest from its wanderings and remains always the same and unchanging with the changeless, since it is in communion therewith.  And this state of the soul is called wisdom.  Is it not so?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Socrates,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;what you say is perfectly right and true.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;And now again, in view of what we said before and of what has just been said, to which class do you think
<milestone n="79e" unit="section"/>the soul has greater likeness and kinship?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;I think, Socrates,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that anyone, even the dullest, would agree, after this argument that the soul is infinitely more like that which is always the same than that which is not.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;And the body?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Is more like the other.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Consider, then, the matter in another way.  When the soul
<milestone unit="page" n="80"/><milestone n="80a" unit="section"/>and the body are joined together, nature directs the one to serve and be ruled, and the other to rule and be master.  Now this being the case, which seems to you like the divine, and which like the mortal? Or do you not think that the divine is by nature fitted to rule and lead, and the mortal to obey and serve?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Yes, I think so.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Which, then, does the soul resemble?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Clearly, Socrates, the soul is like the divine and the body like the mortal.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Then see, Cebes, if this is not the conclusion from all that we have said,
<milestone n="80b" unit="section"/>that the soul is most like the divine and immortal and intellectual and uniform and indissoluble and ever unchanging, and the body, on the contrary, most like the human and mortal and multiform and unintellectual and dissoluble and ever changing.  Can we say anything, my dear Cebes, to show that this is not so?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;No, we cannot.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Well then, since this is the case, is it not natural for the body to meet with speedy dissolution and for the soul, on the contrary, to be entirely indissoluble, or nearly so?&rdquo;
<milestone n="80c" unit="section"/>&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Observe,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;that when a man dies, the visible part of him, the body, which lies in the visible world and which we call the corpse, which is naturally subject to dissolution and decomposition, does not undergo these processes at once, but remains for a considerable time, and even for a very long time, if death takes place when the body is in good condition, and at a favorable time of the year.  For when the body is shrunk and embalmed, as is done in <placeName key="tgn,7016833">Egypt</placeName>, it remains almost entire for an incalculable time.  And even if the body decay,
<milestone n="80d" unit="section"/>some parts of it, such as the bones and sinews and all that, are, so to speak, indestructible.  Is not that true?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;But the soul, the invisible, which departs into another place which is, like itself, noble and pure and invisible, to the realm of the god of the other world in truth, to the good and wise god, whither, if God will, my soul is soon to go,&mdash;is this soul, which has such qualities and such a nature, straightway scattered and destroyed when it departs from the body, as most men say?
<milestone n="80e" unit="section"/>Far from it, dear Cebes and Simmias, but the truth is much rather this&mdash;if it departs pure, dragging with it nothing of the body, because it never willingly associated with the body in life, but avoided it and gathered itself into itself alone, since this has always been its constant study&mdash;but this means nothing else than that it pursued philosophy rightly and
<milestone unit="page" n="81"/><milestone n="81a" unit="section"/>really practiced being in a state of death:  or is not this the practice of death?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;By all means.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Then if it is in such a condition, it goes away into that which is like itself, into the invisible, divine, immortal, and wise, and when it arrives there it is happy, freed from error and folly and fear and fierce loves and all the other human ills, and as the initiated say, lives in truth through all after time with the gods.  Is this our belief, Cebes, or not?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Assuredly,&rdquo; said Cebes.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;But, I think,
<milestone n="81b" unit="section"/>if when it departs from the body it is defiled and impure, because it was always with the body and cared for it and loved it and was fascinated by it and its desires and pleasures, so that it thought nothing was true except the corporeal, which one can touch and see and drink and eat and employ in the pleasures of love, and if it is accustomed to hate and fear and avoid that which is shadowy and invisible to the eyes but is intelligible and tangible to philosophy&mdash;do you think a soul in this condition
<milestone n="81c" unit="section"/>will depart pure and uncontaminated?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;By no means,&rdquo; said he.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;But it will be interpenetrated, I suppose, with the corporeal which intercourse and communion with the body have made a part of its nature because the body has been its constant companion and the object of its care?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;And, my friend, we must believe that the corporeal is burdensome and heavy and earthly and visible.  And such a soul is weighed down by this and is dragged back into the visible world, through fear of the invisible and of the other world, and so,
<milestone n="81d" unit="section"/>as they say, it flits about the monuments and the tombs, where shadowy shapes of souls have been seen, figures of those souls which were not set free in purity but retain something of the visible;  and this is why they are seen.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;That is likely, Socrates.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;It is likely, Cebes.  And it is likely that those are not the souls of the good, but those of the base, which are compelled to flit about such places as a punishment for their former evil mode of life.  And they flit about
<milestone n="81e" unit="section"/>until through the desire of the corporeal which clings to them they are again imprisoned in a body.  And they are likely to be imprisoned in natures which correspond to the practices of their former life.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;What natures do you mean, Socrates?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;I mean, for example, that those who have indulged in gluttony and violence and drunkenness, and have taken no pains to avoid them, are likely to pass into the bodies of asses and other beasts of that sort.
<milestone unit="page" n="82"/><milestone n="82a" unit="section"/>Do you not think so?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Certainly that is very likely.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;And those who have chosen injustice and tyranny and robbery pass into the bodies of wolves and hawks and kites.  Where else can we imagine that they go?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Beyond a doubt,&rdquo; said Cebes, &ldquo;they pass into such creatures.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;it is clear where all the others go, each in accordance with its own habits?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Cebes, &ldquo;of course.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;the happiest of those, and those who go to the best place, are those who have practiced,
<milestone n="82b" unit="section"/>by nature and habit, without philosophy or reason, the social and civil virtues which are called moderation and justice?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;How are these happiest?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Don't you see?  Is it not likely that they pass again into some such social and gentle species as that of bees or of wasps or ants, or into the human race again, and that worthy men spring from them?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;And no one who has not been a philosopher and who is not wholly pure when he departs, is allowed to enter into the communion of the gods,
<milestone n="82c" unit="section"/>but only the lover of knowledge.  It is for this reason, dear Simmias and Cebes, that those who truly love wisdom refrain from all bodily desires and resist them firmly and do not give themselves up to them, not because they fear poverty or loss of property, as most men, in their love of money, do;  nor is it because they fear the dishonor or disgrace of wickedness, like the lovers of honor and power, that they refrain from them.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;No, that would not be seemly for them, Socrates,&rdquo; said Cebes.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Most assuredly not,&rdquo;
<milestone n="82d" unit="section"/>said he.  &ldquo;And therefore those who care for their own souls, and do not live in service to the body, turn their backs upon all these men and do not walk in their ways, for they feel that they know not whither they are going.  They themselves believe that philosophy, with its deliverance and purification, must not be resisted, and so they turn and follow it whithersoever it leads.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;How do they do this, Socrates?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;I will tell you,&rdquo; he replied.  &ldquo;The lovers of knowledge,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;perceive that when philosophy first takes possession of their soul it is entirely
<milestone n="82e" unit="section"/>fastened and welded to the body and is compelled to regard realities through the body as through prison bars, not with its own unhindered vision, and is wallowing in utter ignorance.  And philosophy sees that the most dreadful thing about the imprisonment is the fact that it is caused by the lusts of the flesh, so that the prisoner is the
<milestone unit="page" n="83"/><milestone n="83a" unit="section"/>chief assistant in his own imprisonment.  The lovers of knowledge, then, I say, perceive that philosophy, taking possession of the soul when it is in this state, encourages it gently and tries to set it free, pointing out that the eyes and the ears and the other senses are full of deceit, and urging it to withdraw from these, except in so far as their use is unavoidable, and exhorting it to collect and concentrate itself within itself, and to trust nothing except
<milestone n="83b" unit="section"/>itself and its own abstract thought of abstract existence;  and to believe that there is no truth in that which it sees by other means and which varies with the various objects in which it appears, since everything of that kind is visible and apprehended by the senses, whereas the soul itself sees that which is invisible and apprehended by the mind.  Now the soul of the true philosopher believes that it must not resist this deliverance, and therefore it stands aloof from pleasures and lusts and griefs and fears, so far as it can, considering that when anyone has violent pleasures or fears or griefs or lusts he suffers from them not merely what one might think&mdash;for example, illness or loss of money spent
<milestone n="83c" unit="section"/>for his lusts&mdash;but he suffers the greatest and most extreme evil and does not take it into account.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;What is this evil, Socrates?&rdquo; said Cebes.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;The evil is that the soul of every man, when it is greatly pleased or pained by anything, is compelled to believe that the object which caused the emotion is very distinct and very true;  but it is not.  These objects are mostly the visible ones, are they not?&rdquo;
<milestone n="83d" unit="section"/>&ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;And when this occurs, is not the soul most completely put in bondage by the body?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;How so?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Because each pleasure or pain nails it as with a nail to the body and rivets it on and makes it corporeal, so that it fancies the things are true which the body says are true.  For because it has the same beliefs and pleasures as the body it is compelled to adopt also the same habits and mode of life, and can never depart in purity to the other world, but must always go away contaminated with the body;  and so it sinks quickly into another body again and grows into it,
<milestone n="83e" unit="section"/>like seed that is sown.  Therefore it has no part in the communion with the divine and pure and absolute.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;What you say, Socrates, is very true,&rdquo; said Cebes.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;This, Cebes, is the reason why the true lovers of knowledge are temperate and brave;  not the world's reason.
<milestone unit="page" n="84"/><milestone n="84a" unit="section"/>Or do you disagree?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Certainly not.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;No, for the soul of the philosopher would not reason as others do, and would not think it right that philosophy should set it free, and that then when set free it should give itself again into bondage to pleasure and pain and engage in futile toil, like Penelope unweaving the web she wove.  No, his soul believes that it must gain peace from these emotions, must follow reason and abide always in it, beholding that which is true and divine and not a matter of opinion, and making that its only food;
<milestone n="84b" unit="section"/>and in this way it believes it must live, while life endures, and then at death pass on to that which is akin to itself and of like nature, and be free from human ills.  A soul which has been nurtured in this way, Simmias and Cebes, is not likely to fear that it will be torn asunder at its departure from the body and will vanish into nothingness, blown apart by the winds, and be no longer anywhere.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>When Socrates had said this there was silence
<milestone n="84c" unit="section"/>for a long time, and Socrates himself was apparently absorbed in what had been said, as were also most of us.  But Simmias and Cebes conversed a little with each other;  and Socrates saw them and said:  &ldquo;Do you think there is any incompleteness in what has been said?  There are still many subjects for doubt and many points open to attack, if anyone cares to discuss the matter thoroughly.  If you are considering anything else, I have nothing to say;  but if you are in any difficulty about these matters, do not hesitate
<milestone n="84d" unit="section"/>to speak and discuss them yourselves, if you think anything better could be said on the subject, and to take me along with you in the discussion, if you think you can get on better in my company.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>And Simmias said:  &ldquo;Socrates, I will tell you the truth.  For some time each of us has been in doubt and has been egging the other on and urging him to ask a question, because we wish to hear your answer, but hesitate to trouble you, for fear that it may be disagreeable to you in your present misfortune.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>And when he heard is, he laughed gently and said:  &ldquo;Ah,
<milestone n="84e" unit="section"/>Simmias!  I should have hard work to persuade other people that I do not regard my present situation as a misfortune, when I cannot even make you believe it, but you are afraid I am more churlish now than I used to be.  And you seem to think I am inferior in prophetic power to the swans who sing at other times also, but when they feel that they are to die,
<milestone unit="page" n="85"/><milestone n="85a" unit="section"/>sing most and best in their joy that they are to go to the god whose servants they are.  But men, because of their own fear of death, misrepresent the swans and say that they sing for sorrow, in mourning for their own death.  They do not consider that no bird sings when it is hungry or cold or has any other trouble;  no, not even the nightingale or the swallow or the hoopoe which are said to sing in lamentation.  I do not believe they sing for grief, nor do the swans;
<milestone n="85b" unit="section"/>but since they are Apollo's birds, I believe they have prophetic vision, and because they have foreknowledge of the blessings in the other world they sing and rejoice on that day more than ever before.  And I think that I am myself a fellow-servant of the swans;  and am consecrated to the same God and have received from our master a gift of prophecy no whit inferior to theirs, and that I go out from life with as little sorrow as they.  So far as this is concerned, then, speak and ask what ever questions you please, so long as the eleven of the Athenians permit.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said Simmias.
<milestone n="85c" unit="section"/>&ldquo;I will tell you my difficulty, and then Cebes in turn will say why he does not agree to all you have said.  I think, Socrates, as perhaps you do yourself, that it is either impossible or very difficult to acquire clear knowledge about these matters in this life.  And yet he is a weakling who does not test in every way what is said about them and persevere until he is worn out by studying them on every side.  For he must do one of two things;  either he must learn or discover the truth about these matters, or if that is impossible, he must take whatever human doctrine is best
<milestone n="85d" unit="section"/>and hardest to disprove and, embarking upon it as upon a raft, sail upon it through life in the midst of dangers, unless he can sail upon some stronger vessel, some divine revelation, and make his voyage more safely and securely.  And so now I am not ashamed to ask questions, since you encourage me to do so, and I shall not have to blame myself hereafter for not saying now what I think.  For, Socrates, when I examine what has been said, either alone or with Cebes, it does not seem quite satisfactory.&rdquo;
<milestone n="85e" unit="section"/>And Socrates replied:  &ldquo;Perhaps, my friend, you are right.  But tell me in what respect it is not satisfactory.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;In this,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that one might use the same argument about harmony and a lyre with its strings.  Once might say that the harmony is invisible and incorporeal, and very beautiful and
<milestone unit="page" n="86"/><milestone n="86a" unit="section"/>divine in the well attuned lyre, but the lyre itself and its strings are bodies, and corporeal and composite and earthy and akin to that which is mortal.  Now if someone shatters the lyre or cuts and breaks the strings, what if he should maintain by the same argument you employed, that the harmony could not have perished and must still exist?  For there would be no possibility that the lyre and its strings, which are of mortal nature, still exist after the strings are broken, and the harmony,
<milestone n="86b" unit="section"/>which is related and akin to the divine and the immortal, perish before that which is mortal.  He would say that the harmony must still exist somewhere, and that the wood and the strings must rot away before anything could happen to it.  And I fancy, Socrates, that it must have occurred to your own mind that we believe the soul to be something after this fashion;  that our body is strung and held together by heat, cold, moisture, dryness, and the like,
<milestone n="86c" unit="section"/>and the soul is a mixture and a harmony of these same elements, when they are well and properly mixed.  Now if the soul is a harmony, it is clear that when the body is too much relaxed or is too tightly strung by diseases or other ills, the soul must of necessity perish, no matter how divine it is, like other harmonies in sounds and in all the works of artists, and the remains of each body will endure
<milestone n="86d" unit="section"/>a long time until they are burnt or decayed.  Now what shall we say to this argument, if anyone claims that the soul, being a mixture of the elements of the body, is the first to perish in what is called death?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Then Socrates, looking keenly at us, as he often used to do, smiled and said:  &ldquo;Simmias raises a fair objection.  Now if any of you is readier than I, why does he not reply to him?  For he seems to score a good point.  However, I think
<milestone n="86e" unit="section"/>before replying to him we ought to hear what fault our friend Cebes finds with our argument, that we may take time to consider what to say, and then when we have heard them, we can either agree with them, if they seem to strike the proper note, or, if they do not, we can proceed to argue in defence of our reasoning.  Come, Cebes,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;tell us what it was that troubled you.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Well, I will tell you,&rdquo; said Cebes.  &ldquo;The argument seems to me to be just where it was, and to be still open to the objection I made before.
<milestone unit="page" n="87"/><milestone n="87a" unit="section"/>For I do not deny that it has been very cleverly, and, if I may say so, conclusively shown that the soul existed before it entered into this bodily form, but it does not seem to me proved that it will still exist when we are dead.  I do not agree with Simmias' objection, that the soul is not stronger and more lasting than the body, for I think it is far superior in all such respects.  'Why then,' the argument might say, 'do you still disbelieve, when you see that after a man dies
<milestone n="87b" unit="section"/>the weaker part still exists?  Do you not think the stronger part must necessarily be preserved during the same length of time?'  Now see if my reply to this has any sense.  I think I may, like Simmias, best express myself in a figure.  It seems to me that it is much as if one should say about an old weaver who had died, that the man had not perished but was safe and sound somewhere, and should offer as a proof of this the fact that the cloak which the man had woven and used to wear was still whole and had not perished.  Then if anyone did not believe him, he would ask
<milestone n="87c" unit="section"/>which lasts longer, a man or a cloak that is in use and wear, and when the answer was given that a man lasts much longer, he would think it had been proved beyond a doubt that the man was safe, because that which was less lasting had not perished.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;But I do not think he is right, Simmias, and I ask you especially to notice what I say.  Anyone can understand that a man who says this is talking nonsense.  For the weaver in question wove and wore out many such cloaks and
<milestone n="87d" unit="section"/>lasted longer than they, though they were many, but perished, I suppose, before the last one.  Yet a man is not feebler or weaker than a cloak on that account at all.  And I think the same figure would apply to the soul and the body and it would be quite appropriate to say in like manner about them, that the soul lasts a long time, but the body lasts a shorter time and is weaker.  And, one might go on to say that each soul wears out many bodies, especially if the man lives many years.  For if the body is constantly changing and being destroyed while the man still lives,
<milestone n="87e" unit="section"/>and the soul is always weaving anew that which wears out, then when the soul perishes it must necessarily have on its last garment, and this only will survive it, and when the soul has perished, then the body will at once show its natural weakness and will quickly disappear in decay.  And so we are not yet justified in feeling sure, on the strength of this argument,
<milestone unit="page" n="88"/><milestone n="88a" unit="section"/>that our souls will still exist somewhere after we are dead.  For if one were to grant even more to a man who uses your argument, Socrates, and allow not only that our souls existed before we were born, but also that there is nothing to prevent some of them from continuing to exist and from being born and dying again many times after we are dead, because the soul is naturally so strong that it can endure repeated births,&mdash;even allowing this, one might not grant that it does not suffer by its many births and does not finally perish altogether in one of its deaths.
<milestone n="88b" unit="section"/>But he might say that no one knows beforehand the particular death and the particular dissolution of the body which brings destruction to the soul, for none of us can perceive that.  Now if this is the case, anyone who feels confident about death has a foolish confidence, unless he can show that the soul is altogether immortal and imperishable.  Otherwise a man who is about to die must always fear that his soul will perish utterly in the impending dissolution of the body.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Now all of us, as we remarked to one another afterwards,
<milestone n="88c" unit="section"/>were very uncomfortable when we heard what they said;  for we had been thoroughly convinced by the previous argument, and now they seemed to be throwing us again into confusion and distrust, not only in respect to the past discussion but also with regard to any future one.  They made us fear that our judgment was worthless or that no certainty could be attained in these matters.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Echecrates</speaker><p>By the gods, Phaedo, I sympathize with you;  for I myself after listening to you am inclined to ask myself:
<milestone n="88d" unit="section"/>&ldquo;What argument shall we believe henceforth?  For the argument of Socrates was perfectly convincing, and now it has fallen into discredit.&rdquo;  For the doctrine that the soul is a kind of harmony has always had (and has now) a wonderful hold upon me, and your mention of it reminded me that I had myself believed in it before.  Now I must begin over again and find another argument to convince me that when a man dies his soul does not perish with him.  So, for heaven's sake, tell how Socrates
<milestone n="88e" unit="section"/>continued the discourse, and whether he also, as you say the rest of you did, showed any uneasiness, or calmly defended his argument.  And did he defend it successfully?  Tell us everything as accurately as you can.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Phaedo</speaker><p>Echecrates, I have often wondered at Socrates, but never did I admire him more
<milestone unit="page" n="89"/><milestone n="89a" unit="section"/>than then.  That he had an answer ready was perhaps to be expected;  but what astonished me more about him was, first, the pleasant, gentle, and respectful manner in which he listened to the young men's criticisms, secondly, his quick sense of the effect their words had upon us, and lastly, the skill with which he cured us and, as it were, recalled us from our flight and defeat and made us face about and follow him and join in his examination of the argument.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Echecrates</speaker><p>How did he do it?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Phaedo</speaker><p>I will tell you.  I was sitting at his right hand on a low stool
<milestone n="89b" unit="section"/>beside his couch, and his seat was a good deal higher than mine.  He stroked my head and gathered the hair on the back of my neck into his hand&mdash;he had a habit of playing with my hair on occasion&mdash;and said, &ldquo;Tomorrow, perhaps, Phaedo, you will cut off this beautiful hair.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;I suppose so, Socrates,&rdquo; said I.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Not if you take my advice.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;What shall I do then?&rdquo; I asked.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;You will cut it off today, and I will cut mine, if our argument dies and we cannot bring it to life again.
<milestone n="89c" unit="section"/>If I were you and the argument escaped me, I would take an oath, like the Argives, not to let my hair grow until I had renewed the fight and won a victory over the argument of Simmias and Cebes.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;they say that even Heracles is not a match for two.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;call me to help you, as your Iolaus, while there is still light.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;I call you to help, then,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;not as Heracles calling Iolaus, but as Iolaus calling Heracles.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;That is all one,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;But first let us guard against a danger.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Of what sort?&rdquo; I asked.
<milestone n="89d" unit="section"/>&ldquo;The danger of becoming misologists or haters of argument,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;as people become misanthropists or haters of man;  for no worse evil can happen to a man than to hate argument.  Misology and misanthropy arise from similar causes.  For misanthropy arises from trusting someone implicitly without sufficient knowledge.  You think the man is perfectly true and sound and trustworthy, and afterwards you find him base and false.  Then you have the same experience with another person.  By the time this has happened to a man a good many times, especially if it happens among those whom he might regard as his nearest
<milestone n="89e" unit="section"/>and dearest friends, he ends by being in continual quarrels and by hating everybody and thinking there is nothing sound in anyone at all.  Have you not noticed this?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said I.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;is it not disgraceful, and is it not plain that such a man undertakes to consort with men when he has no knowledge of human nature?  For if he had knowledge when he dealt with them, he would think that the good
<milestone unit="page" n="90"/><milestone n="90a" unit="section"/>and the bad are both very few and those between the two are very many, for that is the case.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;I mean just what I might say about the large and small.  Do you think there is anything more unusual than to find a very large or a very small man, or dog, or other creature, or again, one that is very quick or slow, very ugly or beautiful, very black or white?  Have you not noticed that the extremes in all these instances are rare and few, and the examples between the extremes are very many?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;To be sure,&rdquo; said I.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;And don't you think,&rdquo;
<milestone n="90b" unit="section"/>said he, &ldquo;that if there were to be a competition in rascality, those who excelled would be very few in that also?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Very likely,&rdquo; I replied.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Yes, very likely,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;But it is not in that respect that arguments are like men;  I was merely following your lead in discussing that.  The similarity lies in this:  when a man without proper knowledge concerning arguments has confidence in the truth of an argument and afterwards thinks that it is false, whether it really is so or not, and this happens again and again;  then you know, those men especially who
<milestone n="90c" unit="section"/>have spent their time in disputation come to believe that they are the wisest of men and that they alone have discovered that there is nothing sound or sure in anything, whether argument or anything else, but all things go up and down, like the tide in the Euripus, and nothing is stable for any length of time.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;that is very true.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Then, Phaedo,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if there is any system of argument which is true and sure and can be learned, it would be a sad thing if a man,
<milestone n="90d" unit="section"/>because he has met with some of those arguments which seem to be sometimes true and sometimes false, should then not blame himself or his own lack of skill, but should end, in his vexation, by throwing the blame gladly upon the arguments and should hate and revile them all the rest of his life, and be deprived of the truth and knowledge of reality.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Yes, by Zeus,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;it would be sad.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;First, then,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;let us be on our guard against this,
<milestone n="90e" unit="section"/>and let us not admit into our souls the notion that there is no soundness in arguments at all.   Let us far rather assume that we ourselves are not yet in sound condition and that we must strive manfully and eagerly to become so, you and the others for the sake of all your future life,
<milestone unit="page" n="91"/><milestone n="91a" unit="section"/>and I because of my impending death;  for I fear that I am not just now in a philosophical frame of mind as regards this particular question, but am contentious, like quite uncultured persons.  For when they argue about anything, they do not care what the truth is in the matters they are discussing, but are eager only to make their own views seem true to their hearers.  And I fancy I differ from them just now only to this extent:  I shall not be eager to make what I say seem true to my hearers, except as a secondary matter, but shall be very eager
<milestone n="91b" unit="section"/>to make myself believe it.  For see, my friend, how selfish my attitude is.  If what I say is true, I am the gainer by believing it;  and if there be nothing for me after death, at any rate I shall not be burdensome to my friends by my lamentations in these last moments.  And this ignorance of mine will not last, for that would be an evil, but will soon end.  So,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Simmias and Cebes, I approach the argument with my mind thus prepared.  But you,
<milestone n="91c" unit="section"/>if you do as I ask, will give little thought to Socrates and much more to the truth;  and if you think what I say is true, agree to it, and if not, oppose me with every argument you can muster, that I may not in my eagerness deceive myself and you alike and go away, like a bee, leaving my sting sticking in you.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;But we must get to work,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;First refresh my memory, if I seem to have forgotten anything.  Simmias, I think, has doubts and fears that the soul, though more divine and
<milestone n="91d" unit="section"/>excellent than the body, may perish first, being of the nature of a harmony.  And, Cebes, I believe, granted that the soul is more lasting than the body, but said that no one could know that the soul, after wearing out many bodies, did not at last perish itself upon leaving the body;  and that this was death&mdash;the destruction of the soul, since the body is continually being destroyed.  Are those the points, Simmias and Cebes, which we must consider?&rdquo;
<milestone n="91e" unit="section"/>They both agreed that these were the points.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;do you reject all of our previous arguments, or only some of them?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Only some of them,&rdquo; they replied.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;What you think,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;about the argument in which we said that learning is recollection and that, since this is so, our soul must necessarily have been somewhere
<milestone unit="page" n="92"/><milestone n="92a" unit="section"/>before it was imprisoned in the body?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;I,&rdquo; said Cebes, &ldquo;was wonderfully convinced by it at the time and I still believe it more firmly than any other argument.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;And I too,&rdquo; said Simmias, &ldquo;feel just as he does, and I should be much surprised if I should ever think differently on this point.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>And Socrates said:  &ldquo;You must, my Theban friend, think differently, if you persist in your opinion that a harmony is a compound and that the soul is a harmony made up of the elements that are strung like harpstrings in the body.
<milestone n="92b" unit="section"/>For surely you will not accept your own statement that a composite harmony existed before those things from which it had to be composed, will you?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Certainly not, Socrates.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Then do you see,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that this is just what you say when you assert that the soul exists before it enters into the form and body of a man, and that it is composed of things that do not yet exist?  For harmony is not what your comparison assumes it to be.  The lyre and the strings and the sounds
<milestone n="92c" unit="section"/>come into being in a tuneless condition, and the harmony is the last of all to be composed and the first to perish.  So how can you bring this theory into harmony with the other?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;I cannot at all,&rdquo; said Simmias.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; said Socrates, &ldquo;there ought to be harmony between it and the theory about harmony above all others.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Yes, there ought,&rdquo; said Simmias.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;there is no harmony between the two theories.  Now which do you prefer, that knowledge is recollection or that the soul is a harmony?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;The former, decidedly, Socrates,&rdquo; he replied.  &ldquo;For this other came to me without demonstration; it merely seemed probable
<milestone n="92d" unit="section"/>and attractive, which is the reason why many men hold it.  I am conscious that those arguments which base their demonstrations on mere probability are deceptive, and if we are not on our guard against them they deceive us greatly, in geometry and in all other things.  But the theory of recollection and knowledge has been established by a sound course of argument.  For we agreed that our soul before it entered into the body existed just as the very essence which is called the absolute exists.
<milestone n="92e" unit="section"/>Now I am persuaded that I have accepted this essence on sufficient and right grounds. I cannot therefore accept from myself or anyone else the statement that the soul is a harmony.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Here is another way of looking at it, Simmias,&rdquo; said he.  &ldquo;Do you think a harmony or any other composite thing can be in any other state

<milestone n="93b" unit="section"/>and a greater harmony if it were harmonized more fully and to a greater extent, assuming that to be possible, and less completely a harmony and a lesser harmony if less completely harmonized and to a less extent?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Is this true of the soul?  Is one soul even in the slightest degree more completely and to a greater extent a soul than another, or less completely and to a less extent?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Not in the least,&rdquo; said he.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Well now,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;one soul is said to possess sense and virtue and to be good, and another to possess folly and wickedness and to be bad;  and is this true?&rdquo;
<milestone n="93c" unit="section"/>&ldquo;Yes, it is true.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Now what will those who assume that the soul is a harmony say that these things&mdash;the virtue and the wickedness&mdash;in the soul are?  Will they say that this is another kind of harmony and a discord, and that the soul, which is itself a harmony, has within it another harmony and that the other soul is discordant and has no other harmony within it?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;I cannot tell,&rdquo; replied Simmias, &ldquo;but evidently those who make that assumption would say some thing of that sort.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;But we agreed,&rdquo; said Socrates,
<milestone n="93d" unit="section"/>&ldquo;that one soul is no more or less a soul than another;  and that is equivalent to an agreement that one is no more and to no greater extent, and no less and to no less extent, a harmony than another, is it not?&rdquo;  &ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;And that which is no more or less a harmony, is no more or less harmonized.  Is that so?&rdquo;  &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;But has that which is no more and no less harmonized any greater or any less amount of harmony, or an equal amount?&rdquo; &ldquo;An equal amount.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Then a soul, since it is neither more nor less
<milestone n="93e" unit="section"/>a soul than another, is neither more nor less harmonized.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;That is so.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;And therefore can have no greater amount of discord or of harmony?&rdquo; &ldquo;No.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;And therefore again one soul can have no greater amount of wickedness or virtue than another, if wickedness is discord and virtue harmony?&rdquo; &ldquo;It cannot.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Or rather, to speak exactly, Simmias,
<milestone unit="page" n="94"/><milestone n="94a" unit="section"/>no soul will have any wickedness at all, if the soul is a harmony;  for if a harmony is entirely harmony, it could have no part in discord.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Certainly not.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Then the soul, being entirely soul, could have no part in wickedness.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;How could it, if what we have said is right?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;According to this argument, then, if all souls are by nature equally souls, all souls of all living creatures will be equally good.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;So it seems, Socrates,&rdquo; said he.
<milestone n="94b" unit="section"/>&ldquo;And,&rdquo; said Socrates, &ldquo;do you think that this is true and that our reasoning would have come to this end, if the theory that the soul is a harmony were correct?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Not in the least,&rdquo; he replied.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Socrates, &ldquo;of all the parts that make up a man, do you think any is ruler except the soul, especially if it be a wise one?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;No, I do not.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Does it yield to the feelings of the body or oppose them?  I mean, when the body is hot and thirsty, does not the soul oppose it and draw it away from drinking, and from eating when it is hungry, and do we not see the soul opposing the body
<milestone n="94c" unit="section"/>in countless other ways?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Did we not agree in our previous discussion that it could never, if it be a harmony, give forth a sound at variance with the tensions and relaxations and vibrations and other conditions of the elements which compose it, but that it would follow them and never lead them?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;we did, of course.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Well then, do we not now find that the soul acts in exactly the opposite way, leading those elements of which it is said to consist and opposing them
    <milestone n="94d" unit="section"/>in almost everything through all our life, and tyrannizing over them in every way, sometimes inflicting harsh and painful punishments (those of gymnastics and medicine), and sometimes milder ones, sometimes threatening and sometimes admonishing, in short, speaking to the desires and passions and fears as if it were distinct from them and they from it, as Homer has shown in the <title>Odyssey</title> when he says of Odysseus:<quote type="verse"><l met="dactylic">He smote his breast, and thus he chid his heart:</l><l>&ldquo;Endure it, heart, you have born worse than this.&rdquo;</l></quote><bibl n="Hom. Od. 20.17">Hom. Od 20.17-18</bibl>
<milestone n="94e" unit="section"/>Do you suppose that, when he wrote those words, he thought of the soul as a harmony which would be led by the conditions of the body, and not rather as something fitted to lead and rule them, and itself a far more divine thing than a harmony?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;By Zeus, Socrates, the latter, I think.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Then, my good friend, it will never do for us to say that the soul is a harmony;  for we should, it seems,
<milestone unit="page" n="95"/><milestone n="95a" unit="section"/>agree neither with Homer, the divine poet, nor with ourselves.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; said he.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Socrates, &ldquo;Harmonia, the Theban goddess, has, it seems, been moderately gracious to us;  but how, Cebes, and by what argument can we find grace in the sight of Cadmus?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said Cebes, &ldquo;you will find a way.  At any rate, you conducted this argument against harmony wonderfully and better than I expected.  For when Simmias was telling of his difficulty, I wondered if anyone could make head against
<milestone n="95b" unit="section"/>his argument;  so it seemed to me very remarkable that it could not withstand the first attack of your argument.  Now I should not be surprised if the argument of Cadmus met with the same fate.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;My friend,&rdquo; said Socrates, &ldquo;do not be boastful, lest some evil eye put to rout the argument that is to come.  That, however, is in the hands of God.  Let us, in Homeric fashion, charge the foe and test the worth of what you say.  Now the sum total of what you seek is this:  You demand a proof that our soul is indestructible
<milestone n="95c" unit="section"/>and immortal, if the philosopher, who is confident in the face of death and who thinks that after death he will fare better in the other world than if he had lived his life differently, is not to find his confidence senseless and foolish.  And although we show that the soul is strong and godlike and existed before we men were born as men, all this, you say, may bear witness not to immortality, but only to the fact that the soul lasts a long while, and existed somewhere an immeasurably long time before our birth, and knew and did various things;  yet it was none the more immortal for all that,
<milestone n="95d" unit="section"/>but its very entrance into the human body was the beginning of its dissolution, a disease, as it were;  and it lives in toil through this life and finally perishes in what we call death.  Now it makes no difference, you say, whether a soul enters into a body once or many times, so far as the fear each of us feels is concerned;  for anyone, unless he is a fool, must fear, if he does not know and cannot prove that the soul is immortal.  That,
<milestone n="95e" unit="section"/>Cebes, is, I think, about what you mean.  And I restate it purposely that nothing may escape us and that you may, if you wish, add or take away anything.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>And Cebes said, &ldquo;I do not at present wish to take anything away or to add anything.  You have expressed my meaning.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Socrates paused for some time and was absorbed in thought.  Then he said:  &ldquo;It is no small thing that you seek;  for the cause of generation and decay must be completely investigated.
<milestone unit="page" n="96"/><milestone n="96a" unit="section"/>Now I will tell you my own experience in the matter, if you wish;  then if anything I say seems to you to be of any use, you can employ it for the solution of your difficulty.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said Cebes, &ldquo;I wish to hear your experiences.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Listen then, and I will tell you.  When I was young, Cebes, I was tremendously eager for the kind of wisdom which they call investigation of nature.  I thought it was a glorious thing to know the causes of everything, why each thing comes into being and why it perishes and why it exists;
<milestone n="96b" unit="section"/>and I was always unsettling myself with such questions as these:  Do heat and cold, by a sort of fermentation, bring about the organization of animals, as some people say?  Is it the blood, or air, or fire by which we think?  Or is it none of these, and does the brain furnish the sensations of hearing and sight and smell, and do memory and opinion arise from these, and does knowledge come from memory and opinion in a state of rest?  And again I tried to find out
<milestone n="96c" unit="section"/>how these things perish, and I investigated the phenomena of heaven and earth until finally I made up my mind that I was by nature totally unfitted for this kind of investigation.  And I will give you a sufficient proof of this.  I was so completely blinded by these studies that I lost the knowledge that I, and others also, thought I had before;  I forgot what I had formerly believed I knew about many things and even about the cause of man's growth.  For I had thought previously that it was plain to everyone that man grows through eating and
<milestone n="96d" unit="section"/>drinking;  for when, from the food he eats, flesh is added to his flesh and bones to his bones, and in the same way the appropriate thing is added to each of his other parts, then the small bulk becomes greater and the small man large.  That is what I used to think.  Doesn't that seem to you reasonable?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Cebes.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Now listen to this, too.  I thought I was sure enough, when I saw a tall man standing by a short one, that he was, say, taller by a head than the other,
<milestone n="96e" unit="section"/>and that one horse was larger by a head than another horse;  and, to mention still clearer things than those, I thought ten were more than eight because two had been added to the eight, and I thought a two-cubit rule was longer than a one-cubit rule because it exceeded it by half its length.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; said Cebes, &ldquo;what do you think about them?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;By Zeus,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I am far from thinking that I know the cause of any of these things, I who do not even dare to say, when one is added to one, whether the one to which the addition was made has become two, or the one which was added, or the one which was added and
<milestone unit="page" n="97"/><milestone n="97a" unit="section"/>the one to which it was added became two by the addition of each to the other.  I think it is wonderful that when each of them was separate from the other, each was one and they were not then two, and when they were brought near each other this juxtaposition was the cause of their becoming two.  And I cannot yet believe that if one is divided, the division causes it to become two;  for this is the opposite of
<milestone n="97b" unit="section"/>the cause which produced two in the former case;  for then two arose because one was brought near and added to another one, and now because one is removed and separated from other.  And I no longer believe that I know by this method even how one is generated or, in a word, how anything is generated or is destroyed or exists, and I no longer admit this method, but have another confused way of my own.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Then one day I heard a man reading from a book, as he said, by Anaxagoras,
<milestone n="97c" unit="section"/>that it is the mind that arranges and causes all things.  I was pleased with this theory of cause, and it seemed to me to be somehow right that the mind should be the cause of all things, and I thought, 'If this is so, the mind in arranging things arranges everything and establishes each thing as it is best for it to be.  So if anyone wishes to find the cause of the generation or destruction or existence of a particular thing, he must find out what sort of existence, or passive state of any kind, or activity is best for it.  And therefore in respect to
<milestone n="97d" unit="section"/>that particular thing, and other things too, a man need examine nothing but what is best and most excellent;  for then he will necessarily know also what is inferior, since the science of both is the same.  As I considered these things I was delighted to think that I had found in Anaxagoras a teacher of the cause of things quite to my mind, and I thought he would tell me whether the earth is flat or round, and when
<milestone n="97e" unit="section"/>he had told me that, would go on to explain the cause and the necessity of it, and would tell me the nature of the best and why it is best for the earth to be as it is;  and if he said the earth was in the center, he would proceed to show that it is best for it to be in the center;  and I had made up my mind that
<milestone unit="page" n="98"/><milestone n="98a" unit="section"/>if he made those things clear to me, I would no longer yearn for any other kind of cause.  And I had determined that I would find out in the same way about the sun and the moon and the other stars, their relative speed, their revolutions, and their other changes, and why the active or passive condition of each of them is for the best.  For I never imagined that, when he said they were ordered by intelligence, he would introduce any other cause for these things than that it it is best for them to be as they are.
<milestone n="98b" unit="section"/>So I thought when he assigned the cause of each thing and of all things in common he would go on and explain what is best for each and what is good for all in common.  I prized my hopes very highly, and I seized the books very eagerly and read them as fast as I could, that I might know as fast as I could about the best and the worst.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;My glorious hope, my friend, was quickly snatched away from me.  As I went on with my reading I saw that the man made no use of intelligence,
<milestone n="98c" unit="section"/>and did not assign any real causes for the ordering of things, but mentioned as causes air and ether and water and many other absurdities.  And it seemed to me it was very much as if one should say that Socrates does with intelligence whatever he does, and then, in trying to give the causes of the particular thing I do, should say first that I am now sitting here because my body is composed of bones and sinews, and the bones are hard and have joints which divide them and the sinews
<milestone n="98d" unit="section"/>can be contracted and relaxed and, with the flesh and the skin which contains them all, are laid about the bones;  and so, as the bones are hung loose in their ligaments, the sinews, by relaxing and contracting, make me able to bend my limbs now, and that is the cause of my sitting here with my legs bent.  Or as if in the same way he should give voice and air and hearing and countless other things of the sort as causes for our talking with each other,
<milestone n="98e" unit="section"/>and should fail to mention the real causes, which are, that the Athenians decided that it was best to condemn me, and therefore I have decided that it was best for me to sit here and that it is right for me to stay and undergo whatever penalty they order.
<milestone unit="page" n="99"/><milestone n="99a" unit="section"/>For, by Dog, I fancy these bones and sinews of mine would have been in <placeName key="perseus,Megara">Megara</placeName> or <placeName key="tgn,7002683">Boeotia</placeName> long ago, carried thither by an opinion of what was best, if I did not think it was better and nobler to endure any penalty the city may inflict rather than to escape and run away.  But it is most absurd to call things of that sort causes.  If anyone were to say that I could not have done what I thought proper if I had not bones and sinews and other things that I have, he would be right.  But to say that those things are the cause of my doing what I do,
<milestone n="99b" unit="section"/>and that I act with intelligence but not from the choice of what is best, would be an extremely careless way of talking.  Whoever talks in that way is unable to make a distinction and to see that in reality a cause is one thing, and the thing without which the cause could never be a cause is quite another thing.  And so it seems to me that most people, when they give the name of cause to the latter, are groping in the dark, as it were, and are giving it a name that does not belong to it.  And so one man makes the earth stay below the heavens by putting a vortex about it, and another regards the earth as a flat trough supported on a foundation of air;  but they do not look for
<milestone n="99c" unit="section"/>the power which causes things to be now placed as it is best for them to be placed, nor do they think it has any divine force, but they think they can find a new Atlas more powerful and more immortal and more all-embracing than this, and in truth they give no thought to the good, which must embrace and hold together all things.  Now I would gladly be the pupil of anyone who would teach me the nature of such a cause;  but since that was denied me and I was not able to discover it myself or to learn of it from anyone else,
<milestone n="99d" unit="section"/>do you wish me, Cebes,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;to give you an account of the way in which I have conducted my second voyage in quest of the cause?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;I wish it with all my heart,&rdquo; he replied.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;After this, then,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;since I had given up investigating realities, I decided that I must be careful not to suffer the misfortune which happens to people who look at the sun and watch it during an eclipse.  For some of them ruin their eyes unless they look at its image in water
<milestone n="99e" unit="section"/>or something of the sort.  I thought of that danger, and I was afraid my soul would be blinded if I looked at things with my eyes and tried to grasp them with any of my senses.  So I thought I must have recourse to conceptions and examine in them the truth of realities.  Now perhaps my metaphor
<milestone unit="page" n="100"/><milestone n="100a" unit="section"/>is not quite accurate;  for I do not grant in the least that he who studies realities by means of conceptions is looking at them in images any more than he who studies them in the facts of daily life.  However, that is the way I began.  I assume in each case some principle which I consider strongest, and whatever seems to me to agree with this, whether relating to cause or to anything else, I regard as true, and whatever disagrees with it, as untrue.  But I want to tell you more clearly what I mean;  for I think you do not understand now.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Not very well, certainly,&rdquo; said Cebes.
<milestone n="100b" unit="section"/>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Socrates, &ldquo;this is what I mean.  It is nothing new, but the same thing I have always been saying, both in our previous conversation and elsewhere.  I am going to try to explain to you the nature of that cause which I have been studying, and I will revert to those familiar subjects of ours as my point of departure and assume that there are such things as absolute beauty and good and greatness and the like.  If you grant this and agree that these exist, I believe I shall explain cause to you and shall prove that
<milestone n="100c" unit="section"/>the soul is immortal.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;You may assume,&rdquo; said Cebes, &ldquo;that I grant it, and go on.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;see if you agree with me in the next step.  I think that if anything is beautiful besides absolute beauty it is beautiful for no other reason than because it partakes of absolute beauty;  and this applies to everything.  Do you assent to this view of cause?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;I do,&rdquo; said he.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Now I do not yet, understand,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;nor can I perceive those other ingenious causes.  If anyone tells me that what makes a thing beautiful is its lovely color,
<milestone n="100d" unit="section"/>or its shape or anything else of the sort, I let all that go, for all those things confuse me, and I hold simply and plainly and perhaps foolishly to this, that nothing else makes it beautiful but the presence or communion (call it which you please) of absolute beauty, however it may have been gained;  about the way in which it happens, I make no positive statement as yet, but I do insist that beautiful things are made beautiful by beauty.  For I think this is the safest answer I can give to myself or to others, and if I cleave fast to this,
<milestone n="100e" unit="section"/>I think I shall never be overthrown, and I believe it is safe for me or anyone else to give this answer, that beautiful things are beautiful through beauty.  Do you agree?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;I do.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;And great things are great and greater things greater by greatness, and smaller things smaller by smallness?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;And you would not accept the statement, if you were told that one man was greater or smaller than another by a head,
<milestone unit="page" n="101"/><milestone n="101a" unit="section"/>but you would insist that you say only that every greater thing is greater than another by nothing else than greatness, and that it is greater by reason of greatness, and that which is smaller is smaller by nothing else than smallness and is smaller by reason of smallness.  For you would, I think, be afraid of meeting with the retort, if you said that a man was greater or smaller than another by a head, first that the greater is greater and the smaller is smaller by the same thing, and secondly, that
<milestone n="101b" unit="section"/>the greater man is greater by a head, which is small, and that it is a monstrous thing that one is great by something that is small.  Would you not be afraid of this?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>And Cebes laughed and said, &ldquo;Yes, I should.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;you would be afraid to say that ten is more than eight by two and that this is the reason it is more.  You would say it is more by number and by reason of number;  and a two cubit measure is greater than a one-cubit measure not by half but by magnitude, would you not? For you would have the same fear.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said he.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Well, then, if one is added to one
<milestone n="101c" unit="section"/>or if one is divided, you would avoid saying that the addition or the division is the cause of two?  You would exclaim loudly that you know no other way by which any thing can come into existence than by participating in the proper essence of each thing in which it participates, and therefore you accept no other cause of the existence of two than participation in duality, and things which are to be two must participate in duality, and whatever is to be one must participate in unity, and you would pay no attention to the divisions and additions and other such subtleties, leaving those for wiser men to explain.  You would distrust
<milestone n="101d" unit="section"/>your inexperience and would be afraid, as the saying goes, of your own shadow;  so you would cling to that safe principle of ours and would reply as I have said.  And if anyone attacked the principle, you would pay him no attention and you would not reply to him until you had examined the consequences to see whether they agreed with one another or not;  and when you had to give an explanation of the principle, you would give it in the same way by assuming some other principle which seemed to you the best of the higher ones, and so on until
<milestone n="101e" unit="section"/>you reached one which was adequate.  You would not mix things up, as disputants do, in talking about the beginning and its consequences, if you wished to discover any of the realities;  for perhaps not one of them thinks or cares in the least about these things.  They are so clever that they succeed in being well pleased with themselves even when they mix everything up;
<milestone unit="page" n="102"/><milestone n="102a" unit="section"/>but if you are a philosopher, I think you will do as I have said.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; said Simmias and Cebes together.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Echecrates</speaker><p>By Zeus, Phaedo, they were right. It seems to me that he made those matters astonishingly clear, to anyone with even a little sense.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Phaedo</speaker><p>Certainly, Echecrates, and all who were there thought so, too.</p></sp><sp><speaker>Echecrates</speaker><p>And so do we who were not there, and are hearing about it now.  But what was said after that?</p></sp><sp><speaker>Phaedo</speaker><p>As I remember it, after all this had been admitted, and they had agreed that
<milestone n="102b" unit="section"/>each of the abstract qualities exists and that other things which participate in these get their names from them, then Socrates asked:  &ldquo;Now if you assent to this, do you not, when you say that Simmias is greater than Socrates and smaller than Phaedo, say that there is in Simmias greatness and smallness?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Socrates, &ldquo;you agree that the statement that Simmias is greater than Socrates is not true as stated in those words.  For Simmias is not greater than Socrates
<milestone n="102c" unit="section"/>by reason of being Simmias, but by reason of the greatness he happens to have;  nor is he greater than Socrates because Socrates is Socrates, but because Socrates has smallness relatively to his greatness.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;True.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;And again, he is not smaller than Phaedo because Phaedo is Phaedo, but because Phaedo has greatness relatively to Simmias's smallness.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;That is true.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Then Simmias is called small and great, when he is between the two,
<milestone n="102d" unit="section"/>surpassing the smallness of the one by exceeding him in height, and granting to the other the greatness that exceeds his own smallness.&rdquo;  And he laughed and said, &ldquo;I seem to he speaking like a legal document, but it really is very much as I say.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Simmias agreed.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;I am speaking so because I want you to agree with me.  I think it is evident not only that greatness itself will never be great and also small, but that the greatness in us will never admit the small or allow itself to be exceeded.  One of two things must take place:  either it flees or withdraws when
<milestone n="102e" unit="section"/>its opposite, smallness, advances toward it, or it has already ceased to exist by the time smallness comes near it.  But it will not receive and admit smallness, thereby becoming other than it was.  So I have received and admitted smallness and am still the same small person I was;  but the greatness in me, being great, has not suffered itself to become small.  In the same way the smallness in us will never become or be great, nor will any other opposite which is still what it was, ever become or be also its own opposite.
<milestone unit="page" n="103"/><milestone n="103a" unit="section"/>It either goes away or loses its existence in the change.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said Cebes, &ldquo;seems to me quite evident.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Then one of those present&mdash;I don't just remember who it was&mdash;said:  &ldquo;In Heaven's name, is not this present doctrine the exact opposite of what was fitted in our earlier discussion, that the greater is generated from the less and the less from the greater and that opposites are always generated from their opposites?  But now it seems to me we are saying, this can never happen.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Socrates cocked his head on one side and listened.
<milestone n="103b" unit="section"/>&ldquo;You have spoken up like a man,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but you do not observe the difference between the present doctrine and what we said before.  We said before that in the case of concrete things opposites are generated from opposites;  whereas now we say that the abstract concept of an opposite can never become its own opposite, either in us or in the world about us.  Then we were talking about things which possess opposite qualities and are called after them, but now about those very opposites the immanence of which gives the things their names.  We say that these latter
<milestone n="103c" unit="section"/>can never be generated from each other.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>At the same time he looked at Cebes and said:  &ldquo;And you&mdash;are you troubled by any of our friends' objections?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Cebes, &ldquo;not this time;  though I confess that objections often do trouble me.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Well, we are quite agreed,&rdquo; said Socrates, &ldquo;upon this, that an opposite can never be its own opposite.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Entirely agreed,&rdquo; said Cebes.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;see if you agree with me in what follows:  Is there something that you call heat and something you call cold?&rdquo; <milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Are they the same as snow and fire?&rdquo;
<milestone n="103d" unit="section"/>&ldquo;No, not at all.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;But heat is a different thing from fire and cold differs from snow?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Yet I fancy you believe that snow, if (to employ the form of phrase we used before) it admits heat, will no longer be what it was, namely snow, and also warm, but will either withdraw when heat approaches it or will cease to exist.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;And similarly fire, when cold approaches it, will either withdraw or perish.  It will never succeed in admitting cold and being still fire,
<milestone n="103e" unit="section"/>as it was before, and also cold.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; said he.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;The fact is,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;in some such cases, that not only the abstract idea itself has a right to the same name through all time, but also something else, which is not the idea, but which always, whenever it exists, has the form of the idea.  But perhaps I can make my meaning clearer by some examples.  In numbers, the odd must always have the name of odd, must it not?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;But is this the only thing so called (for this is what I mean to ask), or is there something else, which is not
<milestone unit="page" n="104"/><milestone n="104a" unit="section"/>identical with the odd but nevertheless has a right to the name of odd in addition to its own name, because it is of such a nature that it is never separated from the odd?  I mean, for instance, the number three, and there are many other examples.  Take the case of three;  do you not think it may always be called by its own name and also be called odd, which is not the same as three?  Yet the number three and the number five and half of numbers in general are so constituted, that each of them is odd
<milestone n="104b" unit="section"/>though not identified with the idea of odd.  And in the same way two and four and all the other series of numbers are even, each of them, though not identical with evenness.  Do you agree, or not?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he replied.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Now see what I want to make plain.  This is my point, that not only abstract opposites exclude each other, but all things which, although not opposites one to another, always contain opposites;  these also, we find, exclude the idea which is opposed to the idea contained in them,
<milestone n="104c" unit="section"/>and when it approaches they either perish or withdraw.  We must certainly agree that the number three will endure destruction or anything else rather than submit to becoming even, while still remaining three, must we not?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said Cebes.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;But the number two is not the opposite of the number three.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Then not only opposite ideas refuse to admit each other when they come near, but certain other things refuse to admit the approach of opposites.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Very true,&rdquo; he said.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Shall we then,&rdquo; said Socrates, &ldquo;determine if we can, what these are?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;
<milestone n="104d" unit="section"/>&ldquo;Then, Cebes, will they be those which always compel anything of which they take possession not only to take their form but also that of some opposite?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Such things as we were speaking of just now.  You know of course that those things in which the number three is an essential element must be not only three but also odd.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Now such a thing can never admit the idea which is the opposite of the concept which produces this result.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;No, it cannot.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;But the result was produced by the concept of the odd?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;And the opposite of this is the idea
<milestone n="104e" unit="section"/>of the even?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Then the idea of the even will never be admitted by the number three.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Then three has no part in the even.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;No, it has none.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Then the number three is uneven.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Now I propose to determine what things, without being the opposites of something, nevertheless refuse to admit it, as the number three, though it is not the opposite of the idea of even, nevertheless refuses to admit it, but always brings forward its opposite against it, and
<milestone unit="page" n="105"/><milestone n="105a" unit="section"/>as the number two brings forward the opposite of the odd and fire that of cold, and so forth, for there are plenty of examples.  Now see if you accept this statement:  not only will opposites not admit their opposites, but nothing which brings an opposite to that which it approaches will ever admit in itself the oppositeness of that which is brought.  Now let me refresh your memory;  for there is no harm in repetition.  The number five will not admit the idea of the even, nor will ten, the double of five, admit the idea of the odd.  Now ten is not itself an opposite, and yet it will not admit the idea of the odd;
<milestone n="105b" unit="section"/>and so one-and-a-half and other mixed fractions and one-third and other simple fractions reject the idea of the whole.  Do you go with me and agree to this?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Yes, I agree entirely,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and am with you.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Socrates, &ldquo;please begin again at the beginning.  And do not answer my questions in their own words, but do as I do.  I give an answer beyond that safe answer which I spoke of at first, now that I see another safe reply deduced from what has just been said.  If you ask me what causes anything in which it is to be hot, I will not give
<milestone n="105c" unit="section"/>you that safe but stupid answer and say that it is heat, but I can now give a more refined answer, that it is fire;  and if you ask, what causes the body in which it is to be ill, I shall not say illness, but fever;  and if you ask what causes a number in which it is to be odd, I shall not say oddness, but the number one, and so forth.  Do you understand sufficiently what I mean?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Quite sufficiently,&rdquo; he replied.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Now answer,&rdquo; said he.  &ldquo;What causes the body in which it is to be alive?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;The soul,&rdquo; he replied.
<milestone n="105d" unit="section"/>&ldquo;Is this always the case?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;of course.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Then if the soul takes possession of anything it always brings life to it?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; he said.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Is there anything that is the opposite of life?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said he.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Death.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Now the soul, as we have agreed before, will never admit the opposite of that which it brings with it.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Decidedly not,&rdquo; said Cebes.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Then what do we now call that which does not admit the idea of the even?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Uneven,&rdquo; said he.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;And those which do not admit justice and music?&rdquo;
<milestone n="105e" unit="section"/>&ldquo;Unjust,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;and unmusical.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Well then what do we call that which does not admit death?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Deathless or immortal,&rdquo; he said.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;And the soul does not admit death?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Then the soul is immortal.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Shall we say then that this is proved?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Yes, and very satisfactorily, Socrates.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Well then, Cebes,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;if the odd were necessarily imperishable,
<milestone unit="page" n="106"/><milestone n="106a" unit="section"/>would not the number three be imperishable?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;And if that which is without heat were imperishable, would not snow go away whole and unmelted whenever heat was brought in conflict with snow?  For it could not have been destroyed, nor could it have remained and admitted the heat.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;That is very true,&rdquo; he replied.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;In the same way, I think, if that which is without cold were imperishable, whenever anything cold approached fire, it would never perish or be quenched, but would go away unharmed.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Necessarily,&rdquo; he said.
<milestone n="106b" unit="section"/>&ldquo;And must not the same be said of that which is immortal?  If the immortal is also imperishable, it is impossible for the soul to perish when death comes against it.  For, as our argument has shown, it will not admit death and will not be dead, just as the number three, we said, will not be even, and the odd will not be even, and as fire, and the heat in the fire, will not be cold.  But, one might say, why is it not possible that the odd does not become even when the even comes against it (we agreed to that), but perishes,
<milestone n="106c" unit="section"/>and the even takes its place?  Now we cannot silence him who raises this question by saying that it does not perish, for the odd is not imperishable.  If that were conceded to us, we could easily silence him by saying that when the even approaches, the odd and the number three go away;  and we could make the corresponding reply about fire and heat and the rest, could we not?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;And so, too, in the case of the immortal;  if it is conceded that the immortal is imperishable, the soul would be imperishable as well as immortal,
<milestone n="106d" unit="section"/>but if not, further argument is needed.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it is not needed, so far as that is concerned;  for surely nothing would escape destruction, if the immortal, which is everlasting, is perishable.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;All, I think,&rdquo; said Socrates, &ldquo;would agree that God and the Principle of life, and anything else that is immortal, can never perish.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;All men would, certainly,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and still more, I fancy, the Gods.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Since, then, the immortal
<milestone n="106e" unit="section"/>is also indestructible, would not the soul, if it is immortal, be also imperishable?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Necessarily.''<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Then when death comes to a man, his mortal part, it seems, dies, but the immortal part goes away unharmed and undestroyed, withdrawing from death.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;So it seems.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Then, Cebes,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;it is perfectly certain
<milestone unit="page" n="107"/><milestone n="107a" unit="section"/>that the soul is immortal and imperishable, and our souls will exist somewhere in another world.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;I,&rdquo; said Cebes, &ldquo;have nothing more to say against that, and I cannot doubt your conclusions.  But if Simmias, or anyone else, has anything to say, he would do well to speak, for I do not know to what other time than the present he could defer speaking, if he wishes to say or hear anything about those matters.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Simmias, &ldquo;I don't see how I can doubt, either, as to the result of the discussion;  but the subject is so great,
<milestone n="107b" unit="section"/>and I have such a poor opinion of human weakness, that I cannot help having some doubt in my own mind about what has been said.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Not only that, Simmias,&rdquo; said Socrates, &ldquo;but our first assumptions ought to be more carefully examined, even though they seem to you to be certain.  And if you analyze them completely, you will, I think, follow and agree with the argument, so far as it is possible for man to do so.  And if this is made clear, you will seek no farther.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; he said.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;But my friends,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we ought to bear in mind,
<milestone n="107c" unit="section"/>that, if the soul is immortal, we must care for it, not only in respect to this time, which we call life, but in respect to all time, and if we neglect it, the danger now appears to be terrible.  For if death were an escape from everything, it would be a boon to the wicked, for when they die they would be freed from the body and from their wickedness together with their souls.  But now, since the soul is seen to be immortal, it cannot escape
<milestone n="107d" unit="section"/>from evil or be saved in any other way than by becoming as good and wise as possible.  For the soul takes with it to the other world nothing but its education and nurture, and these are said to benefit or injure the departed greatly from the very beginning of his journey thither.  And so it is said that after death, the tutelary genius of each person, to whom he had been allotted in life, leads him to a place where the dead are gathered together;  then they are judged and depart to the other world
<milestone n="107e" unit="section"/>with the guide whose task it is to conduct thither those who come from this world;  and when they have there received their due and remained through the time appointed, another guide brings them back after many long periods of time.  And the journey is not as Telephus says in the play of Aeschylus;
<milestone unit="page" n="108"/><milestone n="108a" unit="section"/>for he says a simple path leads to the lower world, but I think the path is neither simple nor single, for if it were, there would be no need of guides, since no one could miss the way to any place if there were only one road.  But really there seem to be many forks of the road and many windings;  this I infer from the rites and ceremonies practiced here on earth.  Now the orderly and wise soul follows its guide and understands its circumstances;  but the soul that is desirous of the body, as I said before, flits about it, and in the visible world for a long time,
<milestone n="108b" unit="section"/>and after much resistance and many sufferings is led away with violence and with difficulty by its appointed genius.  And when it arrives at the place where the other souls are, the soul which is impure and has done wrong, by committing wicked murders or other deeds akin to those and the works of kindred souls, is avoided and shunned by all, and no one is willing to be its companion or its guide,
<milestone n="108c" unit="section"/>but it wanders about alone in utter bewilderment, during certain fixed times, after which it is carried by necessity to its fitting habitation.  But the soul that has passed through life in purity and righteousness, finds gods for companions and guides, and goes to dwell in its proper dwelling.  Now there are many wonderful regions of the earth, and the earth itself is neither in size nor in other respects such as it is supposed to be by those who habitually discourse about it, as I believe on someone's authority.&rdquo;
<milestone n="108d" unit="section"/>And Simmias said, &ldquo;What do you mean, Socrates? I have heard a good deal about the earth myself, but not what you believe;  so I should like to hear it.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Well Simmias, I do not think I need the art of Glaucus to tell what it is.  But to prove that it is true would, I think, be too hard for the art of Glaucus, and perhaps I should not be able to do it;  besides, even if I had the skill, I think my life, Simmias, will end before the discussion could be finished.  However, there is nothing to prevent my telling
<milestone n="108e" unit="section"/>what I believe the form of the earth to be, and the regions in it.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Simmias, &ldquo;that will be enough.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;I am convinced, then,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that in the first place, if the earth is round and in the middle of the heavens, it needs neither the air
<milestone unit="page" n="109"/><milestone n="109a" unit="section"/>nor any other similar force to keep it from falling, but its own equipoise and the homogeneous nature of the heavens on all sides suffice to hold it in place;  for a body which is in equipoise and is placed in the center of something which is homogeneous cannot change its inclination in any direction, but will remain always in the same position.  This, then, is the first thing of which I am convinced.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;And rightly,&rdquo; said Simmias.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Secondly,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I believe that the earth is very large and that we who dwell between the pillars of Hercules
<milestone n="109b" unit="section"/>and the river <placeName key="tgn,7012263">Phasis</placeName> live in a small part of it about the sea, like ants or frogs about a pond, and that many other people live in many other such regions.  For I believe there are in all directions on the earth many hollows of very various forms and sizes, into which the water and mist and air have run together;  but the earth itself is pure and is situated in the pure heaven in which the stars are, the heaven which
<milestone n="109c" unit="section"/>those who discourse about such matters call the ether;  the water, mist and air are the sediment of this and flow together into the hollows of the earth.  Now we do not perceive that we live in the hollows, but think we live on the upper surface of the earth, just as if someone who lives in the depth of the ocean should think he lived on the surface of the sea, and, seeing the sun and the stars through the water, should think the sea was the sky, and should, by reason of sluggishness or
<milestone n="109d" unit="section"/>feebleness, never have reached the surface of the sea, and should never have seen, by rising and lifting his head out of the sea into our upper world, and should never have heard from anyone who had seen, how much purer and fairer it is than the world he lived in.  I believe this is just the case with us;  for we dwell in a hollow of the earth and think we dwell on its upper surface;  and the air we call the heaven, and think that is the heaven in which the stars move.  But the fact is the same,
<milestone n="109e" unit="section"/>that by reason of feebleness and sluggishness, we are unable to attain to the upper surface of the air;  for if anyone should come to the top of the air or should get wings and fly up, he could lift his head above it and see, as fishes lift their heads out of the water and see the things in our world, so he would see things in that upper world;  and, if his nature were strong enough to bear the sight, he would recognize that that is the real heaven
<milestone unit="page" n="110"/><milestone n="110a" unit="section"/>and the real light and the real earth.  For this earth of ours, and the stones and the whole region where we live, are injured and corroded, as in the sea things are injured by the brine, and nothing of any account grows in the sea, and there is, one might say, nothing perfect there, but caverns and sand and endless mud and mire, where there is earth also, and there is nothing at all worthy to be compared with the beautiful things of our world.  But the things in that world above would be seen to be even more superior to those in this world of ours.
<milestone n="110b" unit="section"/>If I may tell a story, Simmias, about the things on the earth that is below the heaven, and what they are like, it is well worth hearing.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;By all means, Socrates,&rdquo; said Simmias;  &ldquo;we should be glad to hear this story.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Well then, my friend,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;to begin with, the earth when seen from above is said to look like those balls that are covered with twelve pieces of leather;  it is divided into patches of various colors, of which the colors which we see here may be regarded as samples, such as painters use.
<milestone n="110c" unit="section"/>But there the whole earth is of such colors, and they are much brighter and purer than ours;  for one part is purple of wonderful beauty, and one is golden, and one is white, whiter than chalk or snow, and the earth is made up of the other colors likewise, and they are more in number and more beautiful than those which we see here.  For those very hollows of the earth which are full of water and air, present an appearance
<milestone n="110d" unit="section"/>of color as they glisten amid the variety of the other colors, so that the whole produces one continuous effect of variety.  And in this fair earth the things that grow, the trees, and flowers and fruits, are correspondingly beautiful;  and so too the mountains and the stones are smoother, and more transparent and more lovely in color than ours.  In fact, our highly prized stones, sards and
<milestone n="110e" unit="section"/>jaspers, and emeralds, and other gems, are fragments of those there, but there everything is like these or still more beautiful.  And the reason of this is that there the stones are pure, and not corroded or defiled, as ours are, with filth and brine by the vapors and liquids which flow together here and which cause ugliness and disease in earth and stones and animals and plants.  And the earth there is adorned with all the jewels and also with gold and
<milestone unit="page" n="111"/><milestone n="111a" unit="section"/>silver and everything of the sort.  For there they are in plain sight, abundant and large and in many places, so that the earth is a sight to make those blessed who look upon it.  And there are many animals upon it, and men also, some dwelling inland, others on the coasts of the air, as we dwell about the sea, and others on islands, which the air flows around, near the mainland;  and in short, what water and the sea are
<milestone n="111b" unit="section"/>in our lives, air is in theirs, and what the air is to us, ether is to them.  And the seasons are so tempered that people there have no diseases and live much longer than we, and in sight and hearing and wisdom and all such things are as much superior to us as air is purer than water or the ether than air.  And they have sacred groves and temples of the gods, in which the gods really dwell, and they have intercourse with the gods by speech and prophecies and visions,
<milestone n="111c" unit="section"/>and they see the sun and moon and stars as they really are, and in all other ways their blessedness is in accord with this.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Such then is the nature of the earth as a whole, and of the things around it.  But round about the whole earth, in the hollows of it, are many regions, some deeper and wider than that in which we live,
<milestone n="111d" unit="section"/>some deeper but with a narrower opening than ours, and some also less in depth and wider.  Now all these are connected with one another by many subterranean channels, some larger and some smaller, which are bored in all of them, and there are passages through which much water flows from one to another as into mixing bowls;  and there are everlasting rivers of huge size under the earth, flowing with hot and cold water;  and there is much fire, and great rivers of fire, and many streams of mud, some thinner
<milestone n="111e" unit="section"/>and some thicker, like the rivers of mud that flow before the lava in <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName>, and the lava itself.  These fill the various regions as they happen to flow to one or another at any time.  Now a kind of oscillation within the earth moves all these up and down.  And the nature of the oscillation is as follows:  One of the chasms of the earth is greater than the rest,
    <milestone unit="page" n="112"/><milestone n="112a" unit="section"/>and is bored right through the whole earth;  this is the one which Homer means when he says:<quote type="verse"><l met="dactylic">Far off, the lowest abyss beneath the earth;</l></quote><note resp="Loeb" anchored="yes"><bibl n="Hom. Il. 8.14">Hom. Il. 8.14</bibl></note>and which elsewhere he and many other poets have called Tartarus.  For all the rivers flow together into this chasm and flow out of it again, and they have each the nature of the earth through which they flow.  And the reason why all the streams flow in and out here
<milestone n="112b" unit="section"/>is that this liquid matter has no bottom or foundation.  So it oscillates and waves up and down, and the air and wind about it do the same;  for they follow the liquid both when it moves toward the other side of the earth and when it moves toward this side, and just as the breath of those who breathe blows in and out, so the wind there oscillates with the liquid and causes terrible and irresistible blasts as it rushes in and out.
<milestone n="112c" unit="section"/>And when the water retires to the region which we call the lower, it flows into the rivers there and fills them up, as if it were pumped into them;  and when it leaves that region and comes back to this side, it fills the rivers here;  and when the streams are filled they flow through the passages and through the earth and come to the various places to which their different paths lead, where they make seas and marshes, and rivers and springs.  Thence they go down again under the earth,
<milestone n="112d" unit="section"/>some passing around many great regions and others around fewer and smaller places, and flow again into Tartarus, some much below the point where they were sucked out, and some only a little;  but all flow in below their exit.  Some flow in on the side from which they flowed out, others on the opposite side;  and some pass completely around in a circle, coiling about the earth once or several times, like serpents, then descend to the lowest possible depth and fall again into the chasm.
<milestone n="112e" unit="section"/>Now it is possible to go down from each side to the center, but not beyond, for there the slope rises forward in front of the streams from either side of the earth.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;Now these streams are many and great and of all sorts, but among the many are four streams, the greatest and outermost of which is that called Oceanus, which flows round in a circle, and opposite this, flowing in the opposite direction, is <placeName key="tgn,1120946">Acheron</placeName>, which flows through
<milestone unit="page" n="113"/><milestone n="113a" unit="section"/>various desert places and, passing under the earth, comes to the Acherusian lake.  To this lake the souls of most of the dead go and, after remaining there the appointed time, which is for some longer and for others shorter, are sent back to be born again into living beings.  The third river flows out between these two, and near the place whence it issues it falls into a vast region burning with a great fire and makes a lake larger than our Mediterranean sea, boiling with water and mud.
<milestone n="113b" unit="section"/>Thence it flows in a circle, turbid and muddy, and comes in its winding course, among other places, to the edge of the Acherusian lake, but does not mingle with its water.  Then, after winding about many times underground, it flows into Tartarus at a lower level.  This is the river which is called Pyriphlegethon, and the streams of lava which spout up at various places on earth are offshoots from it.  Opposite this the fourth river issues, it is said, first into a wild and awful place, which is all of a dark blue color, like lapis lazuli.
<milestone n="113c" unit="section"/>This is called the Stygian river, and the lake which it forms by flowing in is the Styx.  And when the river has flowed in here and has received fearful powers into its waters, it passes under the earth and, circling round in the direction opposed to that of Pyriphlegethon, it meets it coming from the other way in the Acherusian lake.  And the water of this river also mingles with no other water, but this also passes round in a circle and falls into Tartarus opposite Pyriphlegethon.  And the name of this river, as the Poets say, is Cocytus.
<milestone n="113d" unit="section"/>&ldquo;Such is the nature of these things.  Now when the dead have come to the place where each is led by his genius, first they are judged and sentenced, as they have lived well and piously, or not.  And those who are found to have lived neither well nor ill, go to the Acheron and, embarking upon vessels provided for them, arrive in them at the lake;  there they dwell and are purified, and if they have done any wrong they are absolved by paying the penalty for their wrong doings,
<milestone n="113e" unit="section"/>and for their good deeds they receive<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>rewards, each according to his merits.  But those who appear to be incurable, on account of the greatness of their wrongdoings, because they have committed many great deeds of sacrilege, or wicked and abominable murders, or any other such crimes, are cast by their fitting destiny into Tartarus, whence they never emerge.  Those, however, who are curable, but are found to have committed great sins&mdash;who have, for example, in a moment of passion done some act of violence against father or mother and
<milestone unit="page" n="114"/><milestone n="114a" unit="section"/>have lived in repentance the rest of their lives, or who have slain some other person under similar conditions&mdash;these must needs be thrown into Tartarus, and when they have been there a year the wave casts them out, the homicides by way of Cocytus, those who have outraged their parents by way of Pyriphlegethon.  And when they have been brought by the current to the Acherusian lake, they shout and cry out, calling to those whom they have slain or outraged, begging and beseeching them
<milestone n="114b" unit="section"/>to be gracious and to let them come out into the lake;  and if they prevail they come out and cease from their ills, but if not, they are borne away again to Tartarus and thence back into the rivers, and this goes on until they prevail upon those whom they have wronged;  for this is the penalty imposed upon them by the judges.  But those who are found to have excelled in holy living are freed from these regions within the earth and are released as from prisons;
<milestone n="114c" unit="section"/>they mount upward into their pure abode and dwell upon the earth.  And of these, all who have duly purified themselves by philosophy live henceforth altogether without bodies, and pass to still more beautiful abodes which it is not easy to describe, nor have we now time enough.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;But, Simmias, because of all these things which we have recounted we ought to do our best to acquire virtue and wisdom in life.  For the prize is fair and the hope great.
<milestone n="114d" unit="section"/>&ldquo;Now it would not be fitting for a man of sense to maintain that all this is just as I have described it, but that this or something like it is true concerning our souls and their abodes, since the soul is shown to be immortal, I think he may properly and worthily venture to believe;  for the venture is well worth while;  and he ought to repeat such things to himself as if they were magic charms, which is the reason why I have been lengthening out the story so long.  This then is why a man should be of good cheer about his soul, who in his life
<milestone n="114e" unit="section"/>has rejected the pleasures and ornaments of the body, thinking they are alien to him and more likely to do him harm than good, and has sought eagerly for those of learning, and after adorning his soul with no alien ornaments, but with its own proper adornment of self-restraint and justice and
<milestone unit="page" n="115"/><milestone n="115a" unit="section"/>courage and freedom and truth, awaits his departure to the other world, ready to go when fate calls him.  You, Simmias and Cebes and the rest,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;will go hereafter, each in his own time;  but I am now already, as a tragedian would say, called by fate, and it is about time for me to go to the bath;  for I think it is better to bathe before drinking the poison, that the women may not have the trouble of bathing the corpse.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>When he had finished speaking, Crito said:
<milestone n="115b" unit="section"/>&ldquo;Well, Socrates, do you wish to leave any directions with us about your children or anything else&mdash;anything we can do to serve you?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;What I always say, Crito,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;nothing new.  If you take care of yourselves you will serve me and mine and yourselves, whatever you do, even if you make no promises now;  but if you neglect yourselves and are not willing to live following step by step, as it were, in the path marked out by our present and past discussions, you will accomplish nothing,
<milestone n="115c" unit="section"/>no matter how much or how eagerly you promise at present.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;We will certainly try hard to do as you say,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;But how shall we bury you?&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>&ldquo;However you please,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;if you can catch me and I do not get away from you.&rdquo;  And he laughed gently, and looking towards us, said: &ldquo;I cannot persuade Crito, my friends, that the Socrates who is now conversing and arranging the details of his argument is really I;  he thinks I am the one whom he will presently see as a corpse,
<milestone n="115d" unit="section"/>and he asks how to bury me.  And though I have been saying at great length that after I drink the poison I shall no longer be with you, but shall go away to the joys of the blessed you know of, he seems to think that was idle talk uttered to encourage you and myself.  So,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;give security for me to Crito, the opposite of that which he gave the judges at my trial;  for he gave security that I would remain, but you must give security that I shall not remain when I die,
<milestone n="115e" unit="section"/>but shall go away, so that Crito may bear it more easily, and may not be troubled when he sees my body being burnt or buried, or think I am undergoing terrible treatment, and may not say at the funeral that he is laying out Socrates, or following him to the grave, or burying him.  For, dear Crito, you may be sure that such wrong words are not only undesirable in themselves, but they infect the soul with evil.  No, you must be of good courage, and say that you bury my body,&mdash;and bury it
<milestone unit="page" n="116"/><milestone n="116a" unit="section"/>as you think best and as seems to you most fitting.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>When he had said this, he got up and went into another room to bathe;  Crito followed him, but he told us to wait.  So we waited, talking over with each other and discussing the discourse we had heard, and then speaking of the great misfortune that had befallen us, for we felt that he was like a father to us and that when bereft of him we should pass the rest of our lives as orphans.  And when he had bathed
<milestone n="116b" unit="section"/>and his children had been brought to him&mdash;for he had two little sons and one big one&mdash;and the women of the family had come, he talked with them in Crito's presence and gave them such directions as he wished;  then he told the women to go away, and he came to us.  And it was now nearly sunset;  for he had spent a long time within.  And he came and sat down fresh from the bath.  After that not much was said, and the servant
<milestone n="116c" unit="section"/>of the eleven came and stood beside him and said:  &ldquo;Socrates, I shall not find fault with you, as I do with others, for being angry and cursing me, when at the behest of the authorities, I tell them to drink the poison.  No, I have found you in all this time in every way the noblest and gentlest and best man who has ever come here, and now I know your anger is directed against others, not against me, for you know who are  blame.  Now, for you know the message I came to bring you, farewell and try to bear what you must
<milestone n="116d" unit="section"/>as easily as you can.&rdquo;  And he burst into tears and turned and went away.  And Socrates looked up at him and said: &ldquo;Fare you well, too;  I will do as you say.&rdquo; And then he said to us:  &ldquo;How charming the man is!  Ever since I have been here he has been coming to see me and talking with me from time to time, and has been the best of men, and now how nobly he weeps for me!  But come, Crito, let us obey him, and let someone bring the poison, if it is ready;  and if not, let the man prepare it.&rdquo;  And Crito said:
<milestone n="116e" unit="section"/>&ldquo;But I think, Socrates, the sun is still upon the mountains and has not yet set;  and I know that others have taken the poison very late, after the order has come to them, and in the meantime have eaten and drunk and some of them enjoyed the society of those whom they loved.  Do not hurry;  for there is still time.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>And Socrates said:  &ldquo;Crito, those whom you mention are right in doing as they do, for they think they gain by it;  and I shall be right in not doing as they do;
<milestone unit="page" n="117"/><milestone n="117a" unit="section"/>for I think I should gain nothing by taking the poison a little later.  I should only make myself ridiculous in my own eyes if I clung to life and spared it, when there is no more profit in it.  Come,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;do as I ask and do not refuse.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Thereupon Crito nodded to the boy who was standing near.  The boy went out and stayed a long time, then came back with the man who was to administer the poison, which he brought with him in a cup ready for use.  And when Socrates saw him, he said:  &ldquo;Well, my good man, you know about these things;  what must I do?&rdquo;  &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;except drink the poison and walk about
<milestone n="117b" unit="section"/>till your legs feel heavy;  then lie down, and the poison will take effect of itself.&rdquo;<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>At the same time he held out the cup to Socrates.  He took it, and very gently, Echecrates, without trembling or changing color or expression, but looking up at the man with wide open eyes, as was his custom, said:  &ldquo;What do you say about pouring a libation to some deity from this cup?  May I, or not?&rdquo;  &ldquo;Socrates,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;we prepare only as much as we think is enough.&rdquo;  &ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; said Socrates;
<milestone n="117c" unit="section"/>&ldquo;but I may and must pray to the gods that my departure hence be a fortunate one;  so I offer this prayer, and may it be granted.&rdquo;  With these words he raised the cup to his lips and very cheerfully and quietly drained it.  Up to that time most of us had been able to restrain our tears fairly well, but when we watched him drinking and saw that he had drunk the poison, we could do so no longer, but in spite of myself my tears rolled down in floods, so that I wrapped my face in my cloak and wept for myself;  for it was not for him that I wept,
<milestone n="117d" unit="section"/>but for my own misfortune in being deprived of such a friend.  Crito had got up and gone away even before I did, because he could not restrain his tears.  But Apollodorus, who had been weeping all the time before, then wailed aloud in his grief and made us all break down, except Socrates himself.  But he said, &ldquo;What conduct is this, you strange men!  I sent the women away chiefly for this very reason, that they might not behave in this absurd way;  for I have heard that
<milestone n="117e" unit="section"/>it is best to die in silence.  Keep quiet and be brave.&rdquo;  Then we were ashamed and controlled our tears.  He walked about and, when he said his legs were heavy, lay down on his back, for such was the advice of the attendant.  The man who had administered the poison laid his hands on him and after a while examined his feet and legs, then pinched his foot hard and asked if he felt it.  He said &ldquo;No&rdquo;;  then after that,
<milestone unit="page" n="118"/><milestone n="118a" unit="section"/>his thighs;  and passing upwards in this way he showed us that he was growing cold and rigid.  And again he touched him and said that when it reached his heart, he would be gone.  The chill had now reached the region about the groin, and uncovering his face, which had been covered, he said&mdash;and these were his last words&mdash;&ldquo;Crito, we owe a cock to Aesculapius.  Pay it and do not neglect it.&rdquo;  &ldquo;That,&rdquo; said Crito, &ldquo;shall be done;  but see if you have anything else to say.&rdquo;  To this question he made no reply, but after a little while he moved;  the attendant uncovered him;  his eyes were fixed.  And Crito when he saw it, closed his mouth and eyes.<milestone ed="P" unit="para"/>Such was the end, Echecrates, of our friend, who was, as we may say, of all those of his time whom we have known, the best and wisest and most righteous man.</p></sp></body></text></group></text></TEI.2>
