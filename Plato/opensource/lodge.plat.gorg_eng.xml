<p>I. </p><p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">pole/mou kai\ ma/xhs</lemma>: Socrates and Chaerephon come just after Gorgias has finished his lecture. Callicles receives them with a jest, the point of which lies in the <foreign lang="greek">ou(/tw</foreign>. In the double expression, the more general precedes, as is natural, the more definite.</p><p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">metalagxa/nein</lemma>: occurs also in <title>Rep.</title> 429 a with <foreign lang="greek">e)pisth/mhs</foreign>, and <title>Leg.</title> 873 c with <foreign lang="greek">ai)sxu/nhs</foreign>. It is rare.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">to\ lego/menon</lemma>: in appos. with the sentence. See G. 137, 3; H. 626 b.</p><p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">kato/pin e(orth=s</lemma>: proverbial, like post festum. This would call up to the Greek mind their public exhibitions, and the banquets with which they closed. Here is probably also an allusion to the extravagant enthusiasm which led the Athenians to designate as festivals those days on which Gorgias lectured. See Introd.  &sect; 4 end
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">kai\ ma/la g'  a)stei/as</lemma>: Hirschig remarks the frequency of such answers as these, which avoid the repetition of the last word of the preceding question. <title>Cf. Theaet.</title> 168 e <foreign lang="greek">a)ll'  ou)/ toi sou= ge, w)= *qeo/dwre, a)/meinon</foreign>, <title>Crat.</title> 391 b.</p><p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">a)ttei/as</lemma>: properly <gloss>belonging to a city.</gloss> It became an adj. of quality inasmuch as city festivals and celebrations are naturally superior to those of the country. It is used here in a good sense, though it may also mean &ldquo;citified.&rdquo;
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">e)pedei/cato</lemma>: the aor. is necessitated by the time-limit (<foreign lang="greek">o)li/gon pro/teron</foreign>).</p><p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">o)li/gon pro/teron</lemma>: the first word is an acc. of extent; the second is adverbial. <pb n="34"/>
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">tou/twn</lemma>: the pl. refers to the fact and its consequences.</p><p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">o(/de</lemma>: is deictic.</p><p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">e)n a)gora=|</lemma>: the omission of the art. shows that this was a phrase like &lsquo;in town,&rsquo; &lsquo;on change.&rsquo; By this time, <foreign lang="greek">a)gora/</foreign> had come in Athens to mean simply the exchange, or marketplace, where people assembled not for public debate (that was in the Pnyx), but for business. It was a favorite resort of Socrates, since there the concourse of people offered him the best opportunity for prosecuting his god-given vocation (cf. Introd. to <title>Apol.</title> &sect; 25, and <title>Apol.</title> 33 a ff.). Cf. Xen. <title>Mem.</title> i. I. 10 <foreign lang="greek">a)lla\ mh\n e)kei=no/s ge a)ei\ me\n h)=n e)n tw=| fanerw=|: prwi/ te ga\r ei)s tou\s peripa/tous kai\ ta\ gumna/sia h)/|ei kai\ plhqou/shs a)gora=s e)kei= fanero\s h)=n, kte(.</foreign> </p><p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">a)nagka/sas</lemma>: the literal meaning is not to be pressed. Chaerephon as the constant companion of Socrates took the liveliest interest in all his actions.

</p></div1>
<div1 type="section" n="447b">
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ou)de\n pra=gma</lemma>: shows the asyndeton of ordinary conversation.&mdash; </p><p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">e)gw\ ga\r kai\ i)a/somai</lemma>: prob. contains some allusion to the story of Telephus, who when wounded by Achilles received from the oracle the assurance <foreign lang="greek">o( trw/sas</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">kai\</foreign>) <foreign lang="greek">i)a/setai</foreign>. The myth was made the subject of a noted  tragedy by Euripides.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">w(/ste e)pidei/cetai</lemma> <foreign lang="greek">: w(/ste</foreign>, when combined with the ind., can for all practical purposes be treated as if it were compounded of <foreign lang="greek">ou(/tws</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">te/</foreign>. Cf. Lat. <foreign lang="la">itaque</foreign>. See on <bibl n="Plat. Gorg. 458d"> 458 d</bibl>.</p><p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">e)pidei/cetai</lemma>: here used absolutely in the same sense as above. The fut. has two sides, one corresponding to each condition; thus it is equiv. to (1) <foreign lang="greek">e)qe/lei e)pidei/knusqai ei) dokei=</foreign>, and (2) <foreign lang="greek">e)pidei/cetai e)a\n bou/lh|</foreign>. Cf. a different case in <bibl n="Plat. Gorg. 502b"> 502 b</bibl>, with note.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ti/ de/</lemma>: the question shows that Chaerephon had not anticipated any great eagerness on Socrates' part.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">e)p'  au)to/</lemma>: the pronoun is emphatic. See on <bibl n="Plat. Gorg. 458a"> 458 a</bibl>. The emphasis is heightened by <foreign lang="greek">ge/</foreign>.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">o(/tan bou/lhsqe</lemma> <foreign lang="greek"> kte(.</foreign>: contains an invitation, the basis of which is given by the clause with <foreign lang="greek">ga/r</foreign>. The original conclusion of the condition was to be <foreign lang="greek">e)pidei/cetai</foreign>, but in the course of the <foreign lang="greek">ga/r</foreign> clause the speaker lost sight of this and continued with the co-ordinate construction.</p><p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">par'  e)me\ h(/kein oi)/kade</lemma>: this shows that the speakers are neither in nor before the house of Callicles. On the place of meeting, see Introd. &sect; 17. <pb n="35"/>

</p></div1>
<div1 type="section" n="447c">
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">e)qelh/seien a)/n</lemma>: Socrates uses the opt. with <foreign lang="greek">a)/n</foreign> a great deal, esp. when he first meets a person. It is the mood of courtesy, but not of argument. In this dialogue the opt. preponderates at the beginning, but the subjv. overtakes it in the argumentative passage 471, 472; while in the whole dialogue the proportion of subjs. to opt. is 3 to 2.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">dialexqh=nai</lemma>: emphasized in order to contrast Socrates' method with the <foreign lang="greek">e)pi/deicis</foreign> of Gorgias.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">du/namis</lemma> (vis): i.e. the power and inner meaning of the art, with which the <foreign lang="greek">e)pa/ggelma</foreign> should correspond,&mdash;the scope or compass.</p><p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">e)pagge/lletai</lemma> <foreign lang="greek"> kte(.</foreign>: cf. <title>Apol.</title> 33 b <foreign lang="greek">w(=n mh/te u(pesxo/mhn ma/qhma mh/te e)di/daca. e)pagge/llesqai</foreign> is the regular word in Greek for &lsquo;advertise,&rsquo; &lsquo;profess.&rsquo;
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">th\n de\ a)/llhn e)pi/deicin</lemma>: it does not follow from this that Socrates considered the <foreign lang="greek">dialexqh=nai</foreign> as a kind of <foreign lang="greek">e)pi/deicis</foreign>. It is only an example of the idiomatic Greek usage of <foreign lang="greek">a)/llos</foreign>, which does not include but excludes the word with which it is connected. Cf. <bibl n="Plat. Gorg. 473c"> 473 c</bibl> <foreign lang="greek">politw=n kai\ a)/llwn ce/nwn</foreign>, <title>Apol.</title> 36 b. See G. 142, 2, N. 3; H. 705. We must use a circumlocution, or another word, in English. In Cal licles' answer, however, the attributive force is regained.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">w(/sper su\ le/geis</lemma>: const. closely with <foreign lang="greek">ei)sau=qis</foreign>, as referring to the invitation of Callicles to come to his home.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ou)de\n oi(=on to\ au)to\n e)rwta=n</lemma>: <hi rend="italic">there is nothing like asking the man himself.</hi> The articular infinitive is a favorite with Plato. He uses it most commonly in the acc. The nom. comes next in frequency, with the gen. a close third. The dat. is much less frequent. The pr. tense occurs nine times oftener than the aor., showing a great advance on Pindar. See <title>Am. Jour. Phil.</title> III. 193-201.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">au)tw=|</lemma>: on account of its meaning (&ldquo;the master,&rdquo; Kr. 51. 5, 4; H. 681 c) is placed in this emphatic position. On the matter itself see Introd. &sect; 7, and the passage from <title>Meno</title> quoted Introd. N. 12. Auditors are present also at the following dialogue (cf. Introd. &sect; 17 end).</p><p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">e)ke/leue</lemma>: imperf., because the same bidding or invitation was given to the different members of the group. <title>He bade us all.</title>
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">kalw=s le/geis</lemma>: expresses more satisfaction than <foreign lang="greek">eu)= le/geis</foreign> just before. <pb n="36"/>

</p></div1>
<div1 type="section" n="447d">
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ti/ e)/rwmai</lemma>: deliberative subjunctive.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">o(/stis e)sti/n</lemma>: <foreign lang="greek">o(/stis</foreign> is regularly used to ask the question &lsquo;who&rsquo; after a neg. (cf. <bibl n="Plat. Gorg. 524e"> 524 e</bibl>, <bibl n="Plat. Gorg. 526b"> 526 b</bibl>); but in all cases it may be used to express the idea of quality. See on <bibl n="Plat. Gorg. 453b"> 453 b</bibl>.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">w(/sper a)\n . . . a)pekri/nato a)/n</lemma>: <foreign lang="greek">w(/sper a)\n ei)</foreign> is phraseological, and the second <foreign lang="greek">a)/n</foreign> comes in unconsciously with the conditional apodosis. The use of the aor. with <foreign lang="greek">a)/n</foreign> in the apodosis, following an imperf. with <foreign lang="greek">ei)</foreign> in the protasis, where both refer to the same sphere of time, is not uncommon. In Plato, according to GMT. 414, it appears to be confined to such phrases as <foreign lang="greek">ei)=pon a)/n, a)pekrina/mhn a)/n</foreign>. But similar constructions with other verbs are found in Dem., Aristoph., Soph., Eur., Xen., <hi rend="italic">etc. Cf.</hi> Dem. xix. 162, Ar. <title>Eq.</title> 507.</p><p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">dhmiourgo/s</lemma>: see on <bibl n="Plat. Gorg. 452a"> 452 a</bibl>.

<milestone n="2" unit="part"/></p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">manqa/nw</lemma>: one example suffices  to make the idea of Socrates clear to Chaerephon; two are not enough for Polus. This is, however, due to the fact that Chaerephon is familiar with Socrates' methods, while they are new and strange to Polus.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">a)pokri/nesqai</lemma> <foreign lang="greek"> kte(.</foreign>: this is the <foreign lang="greek">ti/</foreign> of Socrates' question above in c. The tense shows that it is a general standing announcement.
</p></div1>
<div1 type="section" n="448a">
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">h)= pou a)/ra</lemma> <foreign lang="greek"> kte(.</foreign>: spoken in a wondering, admiring tone which expects an answer. &ldquo;Surely, then, you must have but little difficulty in re-plying, Gorgias.&rdquo; The irony lies in (the inferential) <foreign lang="greek">a)/ra</foreign> as well as in <foreign lang="greek">r(a|di/ws</foreign>. On the pushing nature and insolence of Polus, see Introd. &sect; 14. What is said generally in <title>Meno</title> 70 b (see Introd. N. 12) of the pupils of Gorgias applies excellently to him.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">e)mou=</lemma>: by a very natural shift, <pb n="37"/>  after <foreign lang="greek">tou/tou</foreign>.&mdash;&lsquo;Gor. <hi rend="italic">You may try the experiment if you please, Chaerephon.</hi> Pol. <title>Yes</title>, '<hi rend="italic">egad, and upon me too, if you like, Chaerephon.</hi>&rsquo; Cope.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">kai\ a)peirhke/nai</lemma>: gives the ground of Polus' offer. Possibly he may also wish to intimate that Gorgias may now fairly retire, and yield the field to another.

</p></div1>
<div1 type="section" n="448b">
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ti/ de\ toi=to</lemma>: sc. <foreign lang="greek">diafe/rei</foreign>. &ldquo;What difference does this make?&rdquo; Cf. <bibl n="Plat. Gorg. 497e"> 497 e</bibl>. Polus does not wish to slight his master, but only to win admiration for himself.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">(*hro/dikos</lemma>: this brother of Gor gias (see Introd. &sect; 4) must not be confounded with another physician of the same name who came from Selymbria (<title>Rep.</title> iii. 406 a, <title>Phaedr.</title> 227 d, <title>Prot.</title> 316 d), and was famed as the first to insist upon the value of gymnastics for health.
</p></div1>
<div1 type="section" n="448c">
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">o(/per</lemma>: after <foreign lang="greek">ti/na</foreign> by an easy transfer to the actual idea,&mdash;&lsquo;name.&rsquo;

Aristophon's brother was thecelebrated painter Polygnotus of Thasus.

Polus speaks as from a book&mdash; perhaps from his own book  <bibl n="Plat. Gorg. 462b">(462 b)</bibl>. <pb n="38"/>

 He overdoes the use of those figures, with which Gorgias also was accustomed to amuse himself, i.e. &lsquo;paronomasia&rsquo; (<foreign lang="greek">kata\ te/xnhn . . . kata\ tu/xhn</foreign>) and other phonetic figures in regard to the names of which theorists themselves were not at one. He uses the poetic <foreign lang="greek">ai)w=na</foreign> instead of <foreign lang="greek">bi/on</foreign>. His statements are indefinite and cloudy, and finally he brings forward a wholly general attribute&mdash;as Socrates proves in e by the distinction between <foreign lang="greek">poi/a</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">ti/s</foreign>&mdash;of the matter in question, instead of its name. To speak of rhetoric as <foreign lang="greek">kalli/sth tw=n texnw=n</foreign> is furthermore dialectically inappropriate, although it well agrees with the artistic design by drawing attention thus early to this idea. For other examples of similar mannerisms, see the speeches which go under the name of Gorgias (i.e. in the appendix to Blass' edition of Antiphon), and which, whether genuine or not, show admirably the peculiarities of the  Gorgianic school.

<div1 type="section" n="448d">
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">pareskeua/sqai ei)s</lemma>:  <gloss>equipped for</gloss>.  The phrase is a military one; hence <foreign lang="greek">lo/gous</foreign> is almost equiv. to the later <foreign lang="greek">logomaxi/an</foreign>, &lsquo;disputation.&rsquo; The reference is to the readiness with which Polus begins his harangue.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ti/ ma/lista</lemma>: <hi rend="italic">how so, pray?</hi> To Gorgias' view the question has been well answered.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">8</lemma> f. </p><p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ou)k . . . a)lla/</lemma>: the construction is colloquial. <foreign lang="greek">ou)k</foreign> is to be translated <hi rend="italic">no!</hi> The following clause with <foreign lang="greek">ge/</foreign> serves to give the reason for <foreign lang="greek">ou)k</foreign>, &ldquo;that is, if.&rdquo; The negative color of the whole complex causes the speaker to ground his position by <foreign lang="greek">a)lla/</foreign> where one would more naturally find <foreign lang="greek">ga/r</foreign>. It is not necessary to fill out the ellipsis with <foreign lang="greek">a)\n h(/dion se/</foreign> either in Greek or English.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">dh=los ga/r moi</lemma>: on the personal construction, see on <bibl n="Plat. Gorg. 449b"> 449 b</bibl>. <pb n="39"/>
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">diale/gesqai</lemma>: the most unassuming name by which Socrates can characterize his practice, so completely the reverse of the commonly used rhetoric. The inf. is an acc. verbal noun.

</p></div1>
<div1 type="section" n="448e">
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">w(/sper tino\s ye/gontos</lemma>: equiv. to <foreign lang="greek">w(/sper a)\n ei)/ tis e)/yege</foreign>.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">u(petei/nato</lemma>: cf. the Eng. use of &lsquo;lay down a proposition or principle&rsquo; to serve as analogy for future guidance. Note the asyndeton which appears somewhat harsh, but is not uncommon in clauses with <foreign lang="greek">w(/sper</foreign>. <title>Cf. Alcib.

<p>Socrates accepts tentatively the statement which has been so continually advanced, that <foreign lang="greek">r(htorikh/</foreign> is a species of art, in order to proceed with the discussion. The correctness of this statement is brought under question later.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">a)gaqo/n ge</lemma>: the self-satisfaction of Gorgias is so great that he speaks like a Homeric hero. Note the condescension (perhaps unconscious) in the following <foreign lang="greek">ka/lei dh/</foreign> (<hi rend="italic">you may call me so, then</hi>), of which, however, Socrates takes no notice.</p><p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ei) dh/</lemma>: <hi rend="italic">if . . . really.</hi> <pb n="40"/>

<div1 type="section" n="449b">
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">a)/lloqi</lemma>: on these travels, see Introd. &sect; 5. The vagueness of the adverb stamps the whole statement as somewhat boastful.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">to\ de\ mh=kos tw=n lo/gwn</lemma>: Socrates does not mean that the answers should be restricted to a certain length; but he wishes to exclude those answers which, instead of keeping strictly to the question under discussion, branch off and lose themselves in different trains of thought. By using <foreign lang="greek">kai/</foreign> before <foreign lang="greek">*pw=los</foreign>, Socrates gives us to understand that he fears something similar from Gorgias.

<div1 type="section" n="449c">
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">a)nagkai=ai . . . polei=sqai</lemma>: the personal construction proceeds from the &lsquo;prolepsis&rsquo; of the subject of the inf.,&mdash;a common occurrence with <foreign lang="greek">di/kaios</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">dh=los</foreign>. The real subject of the infinitive is then <foreign lang="greek">e)ni/as tw=n a)pokri/sewn</foreign>. Of this construction Plato affords other examples. <title>Cf.

<p>VII. The scolion was a peculiar kind of drinking-songs, <foreign lang="greek">paroi/nia</foreign>,  sung at banquets. The one here alluded to is mentioned by Plato in <title>Euthyd.</title> 279 a, <title>Phileb.</title> 48 d, <title>Legg.</title> 631 c, 661 a. It probably was composed by Simonides, although according to some it was by Epicharmus. After Bergk's (Poet. Lyr. Gr. iii.^{4} 645) rhythmical changes the words acc. to the Scholiast read as follows:

<foreign lang="greek">*(ugiai/nein me\n a)/riston a)ndri\ qnatw=|, deu/teron de\ fua\n kalo\n gene/sqai, to\ tri/ton de\ ploutei=n a)do/lws, kai\ to\ te/tarton h(ba=n meta\ tw=n fi/lwn</foreign>.

Hence it corresponds to our use of the word &lsquo;master&rsquo; (master-workman, master-mason). Cf. <bibl n="Plat. Gorg. 455b"> 455 b</bibl>. It is noteworthy that only such things are enumerated as, like the assumed result of rhetoric, were reckoned among external advantages; for rhetoric, according to the view of Gorgias, should procure in the state either high office or honors. Hence the scolion is very applicable. Socrates brings forward the physician, the bodytrainer, and the banker, in order to contrast with the subjective judgment  of Gorgias the subjective opinions of others, and thus to show the subjectivity of the answer.

Zeuxis, the celebrated painter and contemporary of Socrates, was a native of Heraclea in Lower Italy. He was the pupil of Apollodorus, <pb n="53"/>  who, by a more delicate appreciation and application of the principles of light and shade in painting, greatly furthered the development of the art, and obtained for himself the surname of &lsquo;Sciagraph.&rsquo; The paintings of Zeuxis, who belonged to the Ionic school, were noted for their delicacy and fine coloring. Besides the Helena which he painted for the Crotoniates (Cic. <hi rend="italic">de Inv.</hi> ii. 1. 1), his most celebrated picture was the Penelope, wherein he depicted with great success pure matronly modesty. The story of his contest with his rival Parrhasius is well known.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">zw=|a</lemma>: a general expression for every kind of pictures.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">kai\ pou=</lemma>: Socrates wishes here to make clear that if we wish to define an object exactly, i.e. so as to make it easily recognizable, it is not sufficient to give the characteristic which it has in common with other objects, but rather it is necessary to mention that characteristic which belongs to it alone and distinguishes it from all other objects. So, for example, it is not sufficient to say that Zeuxis is a painter, i.e. one who either paints or has painted pictures; but in order to distinguish him from other painters, who also paint or have painted pictures, we must state more nearly the kind of pictures which he has painted (<foreign lang="greek">poi=a</foreign>), as &lsquo;he who painted the Helena or the Penelope.&rsquo; But even this is not entirely sufficient, for  there are still other painters who have painted these same objects; but when we say, &lsquo;he who painted the Helena in Croton (<foreign lang="greek">pou=</foreign>),&rsquo; we have definitely defined Zeuxis. <foreign lang="greek">pou=</foreign> could also, and more naturally, refer to the scene of his labors,&mdash;where he had his studio. We must note (1) that <foreign lang="greek">o( ta\ zw=|a gra/fwn</foreign> is only the common designation of all painters, by which they are distinguished from the <foreign lang="greek">lo/gous</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">no/mous</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">suggra/mmata gra/fontes</foreign>, (2) that <foreign lang="greek">o( gra/fwn</foreign> can and must be understood in the same way in which we so often understand <foreign lang="greek">o( a)dikw=n, o( kratw=n</foreign>, etc., i.e. as a generic word, not limited in time (H. 827), (3) that <foreign lang="greek">poi=os</foreign> is often scarcely to be distinguished from <foreign lang="greek">ti/s</foreign> (cf. Xen. <title>Anab.</title> iii. 1. 14 <foreign lang="greek">e)gw\ ou)=n to\n e)k poi/as po/lews strathgo\n prosdokw= tau=ta pra/cein; poi/an d'  h(liki/an e)mautw=| e)lqei=n a)name/nw</foreign><hi rend="italic">;</hi>). With these points understood, we see that the present example suffices to show that to define rhetoric as <foreign lang="greek">peiqou=s dhmiourgo/s</foreign>, i.e. <foreign lang="greek">h( th\n peiqw\ a)pergazome/nh te/xnh</foreign> is insufficient, so long as the <foreign lang="greek">peiqw/</foreign> wrought by it is not more exactly specified in order to distinguish it from that wrought by other arts which come under the same general definition. Cf. moreover the answer of Gorgias, below, <bibl n="Plat.

 </p><p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ei) pa/nta ge ei)dei/hs</lemma>: Socrates' object is finally attained, and Gorgias, lulled completely by this ironical expression of admiration, bursts forth into an eloquent laudation of his art, and a defence of it against all censure.

When the delinquent is brought before the judge, there is some doubt as to his escape, and <foreign lang="greek">o(/pws a)/n</foreign> (equiv. to <foreign lang="greek">e)a/n pws</foreign>) gives expression to this doubt. In the long sentence following the <foreign lang="greek">a)/n</foreign> gradually fades away, and the most common relative construction with the fut. indic. closes the series.

<p>XXXVII. On the role assigned to Callicles here, see Introd. &sect; 15. After Polus has shown himself in capable of maintaining his views of rhetoric against the superior dialectical skill of Socrates, Callicles enters the discussion with a thought quite similar to the one with which Polus had entered it in <bibl n="Plat. Gorg. 461b"> 461 b</bibl>. The view of life on which all of Socrates' deductions rest is so abhorrent to his innermost nature and all his hitherto cherished ideas that he cannot be brought to look upon the principles here advocated as the earnest convictions of a reasonable man. He does not, however, rush into the lists so roughly as Polus, but, being a more polished man of the world, turns first to Chaerephon, who is thoroughly acquainted with Socrates' views. He, however, wittily refers him to the master, in the same words with which Callicles himself had in <bibl n="Plat. Gorg. 447c"> 447 c</bibl> referred Socrates to Gorgias. <pb n="132"/>

The words of Chaerephon contain the challenge, &ldquo;Why don't you rather turn to Socrates himself?&rdquo; to which Callicles replies, &ldquo;But that is just what I do desire.&rdquo; In Callicles' manner of expression we discern his excitable nature as well as his strong faith in his own views, which he is the more surprised to find opposed, not only by Socrates, but also by Chaerephon. Artistically also his words form the text for the discussion which follows.

</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">*)alkibia/dou</lemma>: the mental and moral training of the rising youth was largely directed by prominent older men with whom they associated, usually according to individual preference. One of these prominent teachers, and one who made it the business of his life, was Socrates, and among the young men who clustered around him and followed his conversations was Alcibiades, whom Socrates greatly loved for his mental gifts.

Like his father, he is reported to have been especially beau tiful, and is also mentioned by Ar. <title>Vesp.</title> 97 ff. as a much admired sweetheart. This fact Socrates skilfully uses to characterize Callicles' relation to the Athenian demus. This people needed, like a boy, a leader and guide; but the orators, instead of governing it, regulated their actions according to its whims. </p><p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">tou= *purila/mpous</lemma>: is of course to be understood in the usual way, like <foreign lang="greek">tou= *kleini/ou</foreign>.

Callicles cleverly illustrates his exposition of the opposition between the principles of practical life and this theoretical philosophizing by reference again to the already cited <title>Antiope</title> of Euripides. Antiope had borne to Zeus twin sons, Amphion and Zethus, but was afterwards taken by her uncle Lycus to Thebes, where she suffered for a long time the most cruel treatment at the hands of Ly<pb n="147"/>  cus' wife, Dirce. Meanwhile, her sons were being brought up by a herdsman in the forest. Amphion devoted himself entirely to music, while the active and restless Zethus spent his time in hunting and the care of his herds. Finally Antiope escapes from her prison, and hurries to her sons. Dirce pursues, overtakes her, and is just in the act of having her bound to a wild steer, when the sons, who had been informed of their parentage by the herdsman, appear on the scene, rescue their mother from the hands of Dirce, and bind her to the steer instead. Dirce was then changed into a fountain. Amphion and Zethus attain the sovereignty in Thebes, and fortify it with walls. In this work Zethus contributed his great bodily strength, while Amphion's lyre drew after him the stones. This difference in character as related in the myth (Apollod. iii. 5. 5 <foreign lang="greek">*zh=qos me\n ou)=n e)pemelei=to bouforbi/wn, *)amfi/wn de\ kiqarw|di/an h)/skei</foreign>) suggested to Euripides a dialogue between the brothers, wherein each praises his own calling to the disparagement of the other's.

Callicles closes with a further citation from the <title>Antiope</title>, which Nauck, Fr. 188, gives thus:&mdash;

<foreign lang="greek">a)ll'  e)moi\ piqou=</foreign>  <foreign lang="greek">pau=sai melw|dw=n, polemi/wn d'  eu)mousi/an a)/skei: toiau=t) a)/eide kai\ do/ceis fronei=n, ska/ptwn, a)rw=n gh=n, poimni/ois e)pistatw=n, a)/llois ta\ komya\ tau=t) a)fei\s sofi/smata, e)c w(=n kenoi=sin e)gkatoikh/seis do/mois</foreign>.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">e)le/gxwn</lemma>: is probably, like the corresponding word in the quotation, to be considered as a verb, since the contrast lies not in a single word, but in the whole following clause. Similarly Thrasymachus says, <title>Rep.</title> i. 336 c, <foreign lang="greek">mhde\ filotimou= e)le/gxwn</foreign>. The verb, used absolutely, designates the kind of philosophical activity which Socrates has just practised against Polus. Cf. <bibl n="Plat. Gorg. 472b"> 472 b</bibl>.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">eu)mousi/an</lemma>: was appropriate in Zethus' speech, as he wished to show his brother wherein the <foreign lang="greek">eu)mousi/a</foreign>, which he sought in <foreign lang="greek">kiqarw|di/a</foreign>, was really to be found; less so in Callicles', who probably is thinking rather of <foreign lang="greek">eu)bouli/a</foreign>. The contrast to <foreign lang="greek">fronei=n</foreign> would be <foreign lang="greek">lhrei=n</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">fluarei=n</foreign>.

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">19</lemma> f. </p><p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">e)/gwge kai\ h)/kousa/ tou</lemma>: the following comparisons are probably taken from the book of Philolaus, a Pythagorean who, after having been driven from Italy, wandered to Thebes, and there engaged in teaching and writing. Socrates was acquainted with the Pythagorean teaching probably only orally, from association with his Theban friends Simmias and Cebes. For this reason Plato implies by the manner of expression that this  knowledge, which Socrates himself in nowise valued, was as general as possible. See Thompson.

It is not all <hi rend="italic">choric</hi> lyric which is condemned, but only that part of it which from its connexion with the Dionysus cult had found entrance into Athens and had there been much fostered by the state, which entrusted both native and foreign musicians with the arrangement and production of the dithyramb at the Dionysiac festivals, where contests (<foreign lang="greek">a)gw=nes</foreign>) took place in it. The  founder of dithyrambic melic was the just-named Arion of Methymne (B.C. 600), who resided at the court of Periander of Corinth. He was said to have introduced the <hi rend="italic">strophic</hi> arrangement, and the so-called <hi rend="italic">cyclic</hi> chorus (consisting of fifty members), which was thus named because the chorus was arranged in a circle around the altar. The second period of the dithyramb begins with the settling in Athens of Lasus of Hermione, a contemporary of the Pisistratidae and a teacher of Pindar. But it soon degenerated in Athens by excessive over-refinement and fantastic cultivation, until it received a new impulse towards the end of the Peloponnesian war by the more artistic cultivation of the dramatic and musical elements by Philoxenus of Cythera.

But his claim to fame rests on his comedies. He stands at the head of the Sicilian comic poets, being noted for the ethical nature of his poetry. It was full of sententious sayings, and thereby aroused Plato's interest to the highest degree. He flourished during the Persian war, under the government of Gelo.

<foreign lang="greek">ei(=s e)gw\n a)poxre/w</foreign> (i.e. <foreign lang="greek">a)poxra/w</foreign>, <title>I am sufficient.</title>

Socrates means that he is himself assuming a burden which according to the nature of the matter requires two.

But when the Athenians were dismissed in so humiliating a manner at Ithome, his opponent, Pericles, turning to account the indignation of the people, succeeded in effecting his banishment in B.C. 461. The term of banishment by ostracism was limited by law to ten years. But Cimon was recalled about B.C. 457, also at the instance of Pericles. Since ostracism (Herm. <title>Gr.

Themistocles was banished in  B.C. 471, and went to Argos.
