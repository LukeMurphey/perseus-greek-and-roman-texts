                            <p>Basil Lanneau Gildersleeve was born in Charleston, South Carolina, in
                                October 1831, the son of the Rev. Benjamin Gildersleeve and the
                                former Emma Louisa Lanneau.<note anchored="yes" resp="aem">This

                                with his family to Richmond, Virginia, and lived there through the
                                Civil War. Gildersleeve went to Baltimore, Maryland, in 1876 as
                                professor of Greek at the Johns Hopkins University, which had just
                                been founded. He died in Baltimore in January 1924. Gildersleeve
                                married Elizabeth Fisher Colston in 1866; they had one son, Raleigh
                                Colston Gildersleeve (1869-1944), who became an architect.</p>
                            <p>Gildersleeve was educated at Princeton, from which he was graduated
                                in 1849, and G&ouml;ttingen, where he received a Ph.D. in 1853.
                                He taught at the University of Virginia from 1856 to 1876, when he
                                was invited to join the faculty of Johns Hopkins, Daniel Coit
                                Gilman's new university on the German model.</p>
                            <p>The most important event of Gildersleeve's life, however, was surely
                                the Civil War. Gildersleeve served in the Confederate Army while
                                continuing to teach at Virginia. He saw combat, and was wounded at
                                Weyer's Cave, Virginia, in September 1864. As he puts it himself, <cit>

                                        finally I came very near to losing my life by a wound which

                            <p>Throughout his life Gildersleeve identified himself as a Southerner.
                                In his 1892 essay "The Creed of the Old South," he insists that the
                                most important issue in the war was the sovereign rights of the
                                individual states. "The principle of States' rights was incarnate in
                                the historical life of the Southern people," he says (<ref
                                    target="b.briggs1" targOrder="U">Briggs 1998</ref> p. 377). Near
                                the end of the essay he explains: "That the cause we fought for and
                                our brothers died for was the cause of civil liberty, and not the
                                cause of human slavery, is a thesis which we feel ourselves bound to
                                maintain whenever our motives are challeged or misunderstood, if
                                only for our children's sake." (p. 388) Perhaps; certainly in the
                                newspaper editorials he wrote for the <title>Richmond
                                Examiner</title> during the war (collected in <ref
                                    target="b.briggs1" targOrder="U">Briggs 1998</ref>), he
                                repeatedly attempted to defend or justify the "peculiar
                                institution."</p>
                            <p>Once the war was over, Gildersleeve returned to full-time teaching.
                                When Daniel Coit Gilman began recruiting faculty for a new
                                university, he offered Gildersleeve the position of professor of
                                Greek. Gildersleeve became the first member of the faculty of Johns
                                Hopkins, where classes began in the fall of 1876. He remained there
                                until he retired.</p>
                            <p>Although like most classicists Gildersleeve taught both Greek and
                                Latin, he was primarily a Hellenist. The commentary on Pindar's
                                Olympian and Pythian odes is one of his major works, published by
                                Harper and Brothers in 1885. Apparently it was not very profitable,
                                so there is no companion volume on the Nemean and Isthmian odes.
                                Gildersleeve wrote articles and reviews about Pindar throughought
                                his career; a full bibliography can be found in <ref
                                    target="b.briggs2" targOrder="U">Briggs 1992</ref></p>
                        	<p>Gildersleeve's <bibl n="Gildersleeve grammar">
                                    <title>Syntax of Classical Greek</title>
                                </bibl> is his other major contribution to Greek studies. In
                                addition he wrote a Latin grammar, a commentary on the Latin verse
                                satires of Persius, and many articles and reviews. His most lasting
                                legacy may be the journal he founded at Johns Hopkins, the
                                    <title>American Journal of Philology</title> (AJP), still
                                considered one of the very best journals in the field.</p>
                            <p>Gildersleeve edited AJP for forty years, from 1880 to 1919. In the
                                early days "philology" was broadly construed; the first volume
                                includes articles and reviews on Sanskrit, German, French,
                                Indo-European, English, and Frisian, as well as Latin and Greek.
                                This was typical of the field; early issues of <title>Transactions
                                    and Proceedings of the American Philological Association</title>
                                show a similarly broad range. By 1936, the journal's
                                self-description read "The American Journal of Philology is open to
                                original communications in all departments of philology, and
                                especially Greek and Latin studies" (AJP 57.1 (1936), inside front
                                cover); very few articles outside Greek or Latin were appearing in
                                its pages. In 1967 the focus narrowed again: "The American Journal
                                of Philology publishes original contributions in the field of
                                Greco-Roman antiquity, especially in the areas of philology,
                                literature, history, and philosophy" (AJP 88.1 (1967), inside front
                                cover). Although Gildersleeve's own contributions to the journal
                                were classical, under his editorship the journal covered all the
                                philological disciplines then studied in the US. </p>

                            <p>Gildersleeve was a sensitive reader of Greek verse and had a very
                                strong feeling for its style. His comments on grammar, dialect, and
                                vocabulary have not been superseded by the work of the following
                                decades. With meter the situation is different. Gildersleeve knew
                                only the metrical theories of his own time, and these
                                <emph>have</emph> been superseded by more modern scholarship. The
                                present edition reproduces Gildersleeve's metrical introduction as a
                                historical document, but readers should be aware that it reflects an
                                obsolete way of thinking about Greek lyric meter.</p>
                            <p>Nineteenth-century classicists -- Gildersleeve, Sir Richard Jebb,
                                Gildersleeve's teacher August Boeckh, and the rest -- started from
                                the unarguable idea that Greek meter must have some relation to the
                                music to which the verses were sung, and to the rhythm of the
                                dances. We know that Pindar's epinicia, like the odes of tragedies
                                and comedies, were performed by a singing and dancing chorus. The
                                poets composed not only the words but also the music and the dance
                                steps; it seems clear, then, that all three must have supported each
                                other. Up to this point scholars of the 19th, 20th, and 21st
                                centuries are all in agreement. It also seems clear that metrically
                                long syllables should have longer musical notes, and metrically
                                short syllables should have shorter musical notes. This logical
                                hypothesis <emph>is</emph> supported by the existing papyri with
                                musical notation (collected in <ref target="b.west2" targOrder="U"
                                    >West 1992</ref>). Where the earlier scholars went wrong,
                                however, was in their assumption that ancient Greek music must have
                                consisted of bars or measures of equal length, as does most Western
                                music from the Renaissance to the present. This leads Gildersleeve
                                to lengthen or shorten notes to make them fit an externally-imposed
                                pattern. Moreover, there is no objective way to determine which
                                notes must be lengthened or shortened. Gildersleeve's own example is

                                four measures of 3/8 time, Gildersleeve takes the first three
                                syllables as a "cyclic dactyl" (dotted eighth, sixteenth, eighth),
                                the next two as long and "irrational long" (quarter, eighth), the
                                next one as triseme (dotted eighth), and the last two as long and
                                short. As he observes in his discussion, <ref target="i2s7"
                                    targOrder="U">section 7</ref>, p. lxix, this is not the only
                                possibility, and one must determine by observation which reading is
                                appropriate.</p>
                            <p>But there is no reason this straightforward aeolic colon must be

                                </cit>. Although 19th-century dance music was made up of measures
                                that were always the same size, as far as we can see from the
                                existing evidence this was not true of ancient Greek music. The
                                colon from Olympian 9 cited above is fourteen morae long, not
                                twelve, and would be danced as fourteen.<note anchored="yes"

                                    same; the musical papyri do show triseme and tetraseme
                                    syllables. But they do not show syllables lengthened or
                                    shortened to make regular measures.</note></p>
                            <p>What follows is a description of Pindar's meters from a more modern

                            <p>Aeolic meters are the easiest. An aeolic colon consists of a
                                    <term>base</term>, a <term>nucleus</term>, and a
                                <term>tail</term>, in that order. The nucleus is normally a
                                choriamb, <foreign lang="meter">- u u -</foreign>, but may be more
                                than one choriamb, or occasionally a choriamb with <term>dactylic
                                    expansion</term>: <foreign lang="meter">- u u - u u -</foreign>
                                (so called because it looks like an additional dactyl has intruded
                                into the choriamb before the last syllable). The base is whatever
                                comes before the nucleus, and this is the only position in the colon
                                where anceps positions occur -- positions that may receive either a
                                long syllable or a short one. The tail is whatever comes after the
                                nucleus. One simple aeolic structure (not, however, used by Pindar)
                                is the Sapphic stanza: <quote>
                                    <l>
                                        <foreign lang="meter">- u - x - u u - u - -</foreign>

                                one choriamb, and a three-syllable tail <foreign lang="meter">u -
                                -</foreign>. The fourth line has no base, a one-choriamb nucleus,
                                and a one-syllable tail.<note anchored="yes" resp="aem">This is the

                                    Sapphic stanza should really be treated as one line. See <ref

                                Pindar's aeolics are more complex and may be mixed with iambic and
                                trochaic lines. Olympian 1 is an example of an aeolic song.</p>
                            <p>The other major group of odes are in dactylo-epitrite meter. These
                                songs are built up from two basic units, the <term>hemiepes</term>
                                <foreign lang="meter">- u u - u u -</foreign> and the <term>cretic</term>
                                <foreign lang="meter">- u -</foreign>, with link syllables in
                                between. The <term>epitrite</term> or "four-on-three" unit is
                                    <foreign lang="meter">- u - -</foreign>; in context this is a
                                cretic plus a link syllable. Pythian 4 is an example of a
                                dactylo-epitrite poem.</p>
                            <p>About half the odes are aeolic and half dactylo-epitrite. Olympian 2
                                is neither; although the analysis is disputed, I agree with
                                Gildersleeve that it is fundamentally cretic. </p>

                                Da&iuml;phantos. His brother, of uncertain name, was a mighty
                                hunter, and much given to athletic sports, and this has suggested
                                the unfailing parallel of Amphion and Zethos. The names of his
                                mother, Kleodike (or Kleidike), of his wife, whether Timoxene or
                                Megakleia, his daughters, Protomache and Eumetis, have an
                                aristocratic ring, for there were aristocratic names in antiquity as
                                in modern times. There is no reason for mythologizing Kleodike,
                                Timoxene, Megakleia. As well allegorize Aristeides, Perikles,
                                Demosthenes, because their names happen to fit their fortunes. But
                                Pindar's aristocratic origin rests on surer foundations, and we have
                                good reason for calling him an Aigeid (<bibl n="Pind. P. 5">P.

                                understanding Pindar that it was an ancient and an honored house,
                                and that Pindar was in every fibre an aristocrat. This explains his
                                intimacy with men of rank, and his evident connection with the
                                priesthood &mdash; the stronghold of the aristocracy. To his
                                aristocratic birth, no less than to his lofty character, was due his
                                participation in the <foreign lang="greek">qeoce/nia</foreign>, or
                                banquet of the gods at Delphi &mdash; an honor which was
                                perpetuated in his family; and the story that he was a priest of
                                Magna Mater is confirmed by his own words (<bibl n="Pind. P. 3"

                                politics, of literature, of thought, have shown that out of the

                                by any miracle, but by the process of accumulated force, some of the

                                literary, and especially religious life. Modern illustrations might

                                large contributions to the general rise of culture in song and
                                music. If such parallels are not safe, it may be safe to adduce one
                                that has itself been paralleled with the story of the Island of the
                                Saints, and to call attention to the part that the despised province
                                of Cappadocia played in the history of the Christian Church. A
                                Cappadocian king was a butt in the time of Cicero; the Cappadocians
                                were the laughing-stock of the Greek anthology, and yet there are no
                                prouder names in the literary history of the Church than the names
                                of the Cappadocian fathers, Basil and the Gregories. But, apart from
                                this, Boeotia has been sadly misjudged. Pindar, Pelopidas, and
                                Epameinondas were not all, nor yet the <foreign lang="greek"

                                philosophers. <foreign lang="la">Non sine dis animosus

                                the dithyramb; although it must be noted that the Greeks have an
                                innocent weakness for connecting as many famous names as possible in
                                the relation of teacher and pupil. The statement imposes on nobody.
                                One goes to school to every great influence. It is only honest to
                                say, however, that if Pindar studied under Lasos he was either an
                                ungrateful scholar or underrated his indebtedness to his master.
                                Unfortunately the jibbing pupils are sometimes the best, and the
                                teacher's fairest results are sometimes gained by the resistance of
                                an active young mind. At all events, Pindar has very little to say
                                about training in his poems, much about native endowment, which was
                                to him, as an aristocrat, largely hereditary. We may therefore
                                dismiss Pindar's teachers &mdash; Skopelinos, Apollodoros,
                                Agathokles. It is enough for us to know or to divine that he was
                                carefully trained, and had to submit to the rude apprenticeship of
                                genius. First a drillmaster for others, then a composer on his own
                                account, he had to work and wait. His great commissions did not come
                                until he had won a national name. Goethe has commended, as others
                                had done before and others have done since, the counsel of noble
                                women to all who seek the consummation of art, the <foreign

                                his teacher, gave him a great lesson. In his first poem, he had
                                neglected to insert myths. Admonished of this omission by Korinna,
                                and remembering that his monitress was herself famous <pb n="x"/>
                                for her handling of the myth, he crowded his next hymn with
                                mythological figures &mdash; the fragment is still preserved
                                (II. 1, 2) &mdash; whereupon she said, with a smile:
                                &ldquo;One ought to sow with the hand, not with the whole
                                sack&rdquo; (<foreign lang="greek">th=| xeiri\ dei=n spei/rein
                                    a)lla\ mh\ o(/lw| tw=| qula/kw|</foreign>). It is unnecessary to
                                emphasize the feminine tact of the advice. On another occasion
                                Korinna is said to have blamed Pindar for having used an Attic word.
                                This, also, is not a bad invention. It accords with the conservative
                                character of woman; it accords with the story that Korinna won a
                                victory over Pindar by the familiar charm of her Boeotian dialect as
                                well as by the beauty of her person, a beauty not lost in the
                                picture at Tanagra, which represented her in the act of encircling
                                her head with a fillet of victory. Aelian, an utterly untrustworthy
                                scribbler, adds that Pindar, in the bitterness of his heart, called
                                his successful rival a swine. If Pindar used the phrase at all, it
                                must be remembered that <foreign lang="greek">*boiwti/a
                                u(=s</foreign> (<bibl n="Pind. O. 6">O. 6.90</bibl>) was a common
                                expression &mdash; half spiteful, half sportive &mdash; and
                                that the moral character of the swine stood higher with the Greeks
                                than it stands with us. The swine-woman of Phokylides, who was
                                neither good nor bad, was not the sow of the Old Testament or the
                                New. The Greeks were brotherly to the lower animals. Bull, cow,
                                heifer, cock, ass, dog, were at all events not beneath the level of
                                the highest poetry.</p>
                            <p>Encouraged, perhaps, by Korinna's success, a younger poetess, Myrtis,
                                attempted to cope with Pindar. She was ingloriously<note

                                (born 525 B.C.), Pindar suggests a comparison with the great

                                nay, no matter how many fine sentiments and exemplary reflections
                                they may have in common, the inner dissidence remains.<note

                                &mdash; as it is safe to call a cause after it has been
                                successful? Within the state there seems to be no question that
                                Pindar was a thoroughpaced aristocrat, and those who think they have
                                noticed greater liberality in the middle of his life have to
                                acknowledge that he became more rigid towards the close. Without the

                                stirred by the visible working of the divine power in setting up and
                                putting down. He could not but be proud of the very victories that
                                told against his own country, and yet there is no note in all his
                                poems that shows the kinship that reveals itself in Simonides. The
                                story that the famous fragment in praise of Athens brought upon him
                                the displeasure of his countrymen, which they manifested by the
                                imposition of a heavy fine, reimbursed twofold by the Athenians
                                &mdash; this story, with all its variations, the statue, the
                                    <foreign lang="greek">proceni/a</foreign>, has not escaped the
                                cavils of the critics, and does not, in any case, prove anything
                                more than a generous recognition of the prowess of an alien state,
                                if, after all, anything Greek could be alien to a man so fully in
                                sympathy with all <pb n="xii"/> that made Greece what it was. For in
                                the sense that he loved all Greece, that he felt the ties of blood,
                                of speech, above all, the ties of religion, Pindar was Panhellenic.
                                The pressure of the barbarian that drew those ties tighter for
                                Greece generally, drew them tighter for him also; but how? We are in
                                danger of losing our historical perspective by making Pindar feel
                                the same stir in the same way as Aischylos. If he had, he would not
                                have been a true Theban; and if he had not been a true Theban, he
                                would not have been a true Greek. The man whose love for his country
                                knows no local root, is a man whose love for his country is a poor
                                abstraction; and it is no discredit to Pindar that he went honestly
                                with his state in the struggle. It was no treason to Medize before
                                there was a Greece, and the Greece that came out of the Persian war
                                was a very different thing from the cantons that ranged themselves
                                on this side and on that of a quarrel which, we may be sure, bore
                                another aspect to those who stood aloof from it than it wears in the
                                eyes of moderns, who have all learned to be Hellenic patriots. A
                                little experience of a losing side might aid historical vision. That
                                Pindar should have had an intense admiration of the New Greece,
                                should have felt the impulse of the grand period that followed
                                Salamis and Plataia, should have appreciated the woe that would have
                                come on Greece had the Persians been successful, and should have
                                seen the finger of God in the new evolution of Hellas &mdash;
                                all this is not incompatible with an attitude during the Persian war
                                that those who see the end and do not understand the beginning may
                                not consider respectable.</p>

                                although we must not suppose that Pindar went whithersoever his song
                                went, he was not a home-keeping man. His long sojourn in Sicily is
                                beyond a doubt. Aigina must have been to him a second home. Journeys
                                to Olympia, to Delphi, to Nemea, are certain. If he studied under
                                Lasos, he must have studied at Athens, and it is likely that he was
                                familiar with many parts <pb n="xiii"/> of Greece, that he went as
                                far north as Macedon, as far south as Kyrene. Everywhere he was
                                received with respect, with <note anchored="yes" place="marg"
                                >Myths.</note>veneration. Myths were woven about him as about few
                                poets, even in myth-loving Greece. Not only did the princes of earth
                                treat him as their peer, but the gods showed him distinguished
                                honor. The Delphic priests, as we have seen, invited him to the
                                    <foreign lang="greek">qeoce/nia</foreign> as a guest of the
                                divinities, and, more than this, Pan himself sang a poem of
                                Pindar's, and Pindar returned thanks for the honor in the <foreign

                                the other that Pindar had a vision of a walking statue of Magna
                                Mater, and it is needless to say that Magna Mater, Pan, and the rest
                                are all combinations from various allusions in his poems. Unworthy
                                of critical examination as they are, such stories are not to be
                                passed by in silence, because they reflect the esteem in which the
                                poet was held.</p>
                            <p>The death of Pindar, as well as his life, was a fruitful theme. The
                                poet prayed for that which was best for man. The god, &mdash;
                                Ammon, or Apollo, &mdash; sent him death on the lap of his
                                favorite Theoxenos, &mdash; according to one legend, in the
                                theatre at Argos, according to another, in the gymnasium. His bones,
                                however, rested in Thebes. Persephone &mdash; or was it Demeter?
                                &mdash; <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Death of

                                having celebrated her in song, her alone of all the deities, and she
                                prophesied at the same time that he would soon make up for his
                                shortcomings when he should be with her. In less than ten days
                                Pindar had gone to &ldquo;the blackwalled house of
                                Phersephona&rdquo; (<bibl n="Pind. O. 14">O. 14.20</bibl>),
                                daughter of Demeter. After his death he appeared in vision to an
                                aged kinswoman, and repeated a poem on Persephone, which she wrote
                                down after she awoke, as Coleridge did Kubla Khan, and thus
                                preserved it for after-times. The time of Pindar's death is very

                                advanced age. Some make him die at eighty; others see no proof of
                                his having gone beyond sixtysix. One prudent soul, with wise
                                reserve, says he did not live to see the outbreak of the
                                Peloponnesian war. The latest poem <pb n="xiv"/> that we can date
                                certainly is O. 4 (Ol. 82, 452 B.C.), but P. 8 is often assigned to
                                450 B.C.</p>
                            <p>Sundry apophthegms are attributed to Pindar. Most of them show the

                                expressions at least reproduce the temper of the man as conceived by
                                antiquity. Such a self-contained personage could never have made
                                himself loved by a wide circle. Admired he was without stint, often
                                without true insight. The reverence paid his genius was manifested
                                in many ways. Familiar to all is the story that when Thebes was

                                the others, says Eustathios, because they addressed themselves more
                                to human interests, the myths were fewer, and the obscurity was
                                less. But these reasons, which are strange to us now, do not account
                                for the survival. That which embodies the truest, inliest life of a

                                        The greatest master of this mimetic composition was

                                        than the paean, and represented the exuberant joy of the
                                        festival. Pindar composed a hyporchema in honor of Hieron,
                                        of which we have fragments; and famous is the passage also

                                        to singer, now to the character of the rhythm. Engelbrecht,
                                        the most recent investigator, maintains that it was a
                                        generic name for the lighter Aiolian (Terpandrian)
                                        composition in contradistinction to the gravity of the epic.
                                        As developed in literature the <foreign lang="xgreek"
                                        >skolia</foreign> were brief, pithy songs, almost
                                        epigrammatic. The themes were love, wine, the philosophy of
                                        life, the stirring scenes of history. Clement of Alexandreia
                                        compares them oddly, but not ineffectively, with the psalms.
                                        The most famous of all the Greek <foreign lang="greek"

                                        one in which Pindar attained the highest excellence.
                                        Simonides, his rival, touched tenderer chords in the
                                            <foreign lang="greek">qrh=nos</foreign>, or

                                        those who died at Thermopylai, are among the most precious
                                        remains of Greek poetry. But Pindar's <foreign lang="greek"
                                            >qrh=noi</foreign> struck a higher key, and at the sound
                                        of his music the gates of the world beyond roll back. The

                                predecessors of these two princes of Hellenic song, to whom the full
                                artistic development of the lyric chorus was peculiarly due, pausing
                                only to point out to the beginner in Pindar, who is ordinarily more
                                familiar with the tragic chorus than with any other, the fundamental
                                difference between tragic and lyric. The tragic chorus has been
                                called the ideal spectator, the spectator who represents the people.
                                It is the conscience, the heart of the people. In the best days of
                                the drama the chorus follows every turn <note anchored="yes"

                                    <pb n="xviii"/> above. If the coryphaeus or head man speaks, he
                                speaks as the representative of the whole.</p>
                            <p>But in Pindar the chorus is the mouthpiece of the poet, and does not
                                represent the people except so far as Pindar, <note anchored="yes"

                                expresses the thought of the Greeks and reflects their nationality.
                                In the tragic chorus old men and young maidens, hardy mariners and
                                captive women are introduced; but under all the dramatic proprieties
                                of expression, we see the beating of the Greek heart, we hear the
                                sound of the Greek voice. In Pindar's <foreign lang="xgreek"
                                    >epinikion</foreign> we never forget Pindar.</p>
                            <p>The victories in honor of which these <foreign lang="xgreek"
                                >epinikia</foreign> were composed gave rise to general rejoicing in
                                the cantons of the victors, and a numerous chorus was trained to
                                celebrate duly the solemn festivity. This public character brought
                                with it <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Scope of the

                                    <foreign lang="xgreek">epinikion</foreign> took a wider scope.
                                It is not limited to one narrow line of thought, one narrow channel
                                of feeling. There is festal joy in the <foreign lang="xgreek"
                                    >epinikion,</foreign> wise and thoughtful counsel, the uplifting
                                of the heart in prayer, the inspiration of a fervent patriotism; all
                                these, but none of them constitutes its character. That character is
                                to be sought in the name itself. The <foreign lang="xgreek"
                                    >epinikion</foreign> lifts the temporary victory to the high
                                level of the eternal prevalence of the beautiful and the good over
                                the foul and the base, the victor is transfigured into a glorious
                                personification of his race, and the present is reflected,
                                magnified, illuminated in the mirror of the mythic past. Pindar
                                rises to the height of his great argument. A Theban of the Thebans,
                                an Aigeid, a Kadmeian he is, and continues to be, but the games were
                                a pledge and a prophecy of unity, and in the <foreign lang="xgreek"
                                    >epinikia</foreign> Pindar is national, is Panhellenic. From the
                                summit of Parnassos he sweeps with impartial eye the horizon that
                                bounds Greek habitation. Far in the west lies Sicily, &ldquo;the

                                residents of that famous island which Pindar loved with all the love
                                of kindred. &ldquo;Nor far from the Charites fell her
                                lot,&rdquo; &ldquo;this city of justice,&rdquo;
                                &ldquo;this island that had reached unto the valorous deeds of

                                rapid sweep Lakedaimon and Thessaly. &ldquo;If Lakedaimon is

                                &ldquo;famed&rdquo; Opus, now to Orchomenos by the waters of
                                Kephissos, land of steeds, dwelling-place of the Charites, and then
                                his eye rests in brooding love on Thebes, the theme of his earliest
                                song, &ldquo;Thebes of the seven gates, mother mine, Thebes of
                                the golden shield.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>It is evident, then, that the theme was no narrow one, that all that
                                was best, highest, most consecrated, all the essential Hellenism in
                                Pindar had ample scope. And now, even to <pb n="xx"/> those who know
                                nothing of Pindar, except by the hearing of the ear, the great games
                                of Greece have been brought nearer by the recent excavations at
                                Olympia, and the brilliant scene <note anchored="yes" place="marg"
                                    >The games.</note>of the Olympian festival is more vivid than
                                ever to the imagination. We see the troops of pilgrims and the hosts
                                of traffickers wending their way to the banks of the Alpheios, the
                                rhetorician conning his speech, the poet hugging his roll of verse,
                                the painter nursing his picture, all seeking gold or glory at the
                                festival. Few landscapes so familiar now as the plain of Pisa, with
                                its sacred river and his mischievous brother, Kladeos. The fancy can
                                clothe the Altis again with the olive, and raise sunny Kronion to
                                its pristine height, and crown it with the shrine to which it owes
                                its name. We see again temples and treasure-houses, the flashing
                                feet of the runners, the whirlwind rush of the chariots, the darting
                                of the race-horses, the resolute faces of the men who ran in armor,
                                the gleaming flight of the javelins, the tough persistence of the
                                wrestlers, each striving to put off on his antagonist the foulness
                                of defeat. The scene is lighted up by the midmonth moon, and the
                                revolving Horai seem to have brought back the music of the past to
                                which they danced more than two thousand years ago. Everything that
                                has been brought to light in Olympia has brought with it new light
                                for the scene, for the games. The Hermes of Praxiteles is henceforth
                                for <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Olympia.</note>us the
                                impersonation of the youthful athlete, whose physical prowess has
                                not made him forget tenderness and reverence. The Nike of Paionios
                                revives for us the resistless rush of victory; the breeze that fills
                                her robe quickens the blood in our veins. Stadion, the oldest of all
                                the games, most characteristic of all, as it symbolized Greek
                                nimbleness of wit, Greek simplicity of taste, pentathlon,
                                pancration, the chariot race, the race with horses, all these become
                                more real to us for statue and vase, disk and tablet. We mingle in
                                the eager crowds, we feel the tremulous excitement, we too become
                                passionate partisans, and swell the volume of cheers. Many masters
                                of style have pictured to us the Olympic games, but these things
                                belong to masters of style, and no <pb n="xxi"/> futile rivalry will
                                be attempted here with what has helped so many to a clearer image of
                                the great scene. Yet, after all that has been said by word-painter
                                and by archaeologist, the poet must give the poet's meaning to the
                                whole. Reconstruct Greek life and we shall better understand Pindar.
                                With all my heart; but after the reconstruction we shall need the
                                poet's light as much as ever, if not more.</p>
                            <p>It is only in accordance with the principle of the organic unity of
                                Hellenism that the acme of Greek lyric art should have embodied the
                                acme of Greek festal life. The great games of Greece are as
                                thoroughly characteristic of her nationality as the choral poetry
                                which was the expression of them and the crown of them. Choruses we
                                find everywhere, games we find everywhere, but despite all recent
                                advance in athleticism, the Greek games were superior in plastic
                                beauty to their modern analogues, as superior as were the Greek
                                choruses to the rude dance and the ruder song of May-pole and
                                vintage. The point of departure may have been the same, but the
                                Greeks alone arrived.</p>
                            <p>The origin of the great games of Greece is to be sought in <note

                                regulation that controlled these famous contests. The times of the

                                religious as well as an astronomical cycle. Eight years, the great

                                subdivided into shorter periods for the performance of the games.</p>
                            <p>The contests themselves may have come over from Asia, as Thukydides
                                says, but a marked point of difference was the <note anchored="yes"

                                prizes, which so astonished the attendants of Xerxes. At other games
                                prizes of value were bestowed, and lists are given in Pindar, but at
                                the great games the prize was a simple wreath. It is <pb n="xxii"/>
                                true that abundant honor awaited the victor at home, special seats
                                at festivals, free table in the prytaneion, and other immunities and
                                privileges, but the honor was the main thing, and though it was not
                                dearly bought, &mdash; for the two great historians, Herodotos
                                and Thukydides, unlike in so many things, never forget to mention
                                the agonistic achievements of the characters that cross their pages,
                                &mdash; though the honor was not dearly bought, it was bought
                                not only with toil, but with money, whether in training for the
                                contest, or in outlay for horse and chariot, or in the celebration
                                of the victory.</p>
                            <p>Early noted, early emphasized, was another difference between Greek
                                games and Oriental. The human form, as some<note anchored="yes"

                                of day, as to the eye of the god. The Oriental games bore the mark
                                of their bloody origin in self-mutilation. Under Dorian influence,
                                even the Ionian dropped his trailing robes and brought a living
                                sacrifice to his deity, the fresh bloom of young manhood, the rich
                                efflorescence of the gifts of fortune.</p>
                            <p>Of these festivals the greatest was the Olympian, &ldquo;the sun
                                in the void ether,&rdquo; that makes the lesser lights pale into

                                night, and makes night look blacker by its brilliancy. The
                                establishment of it, or the re-establishment of it, marks the union
                                of the Doric island of Pelops, and it speedily rose to national
                                importance. The first recorded victory is that of Koroibos (<foreign

                                is assigned to 573 B.C., of the Isthmian to 582 B.C., and it is no
                                mere coincidence that the rise of this <pb n="xxiii"/> new life
                                belongs to the same century that witnessed the downfall of the

                            <p>There were games all over Greece &mdash; one sometimes wearies of

                                all more or less under Delphic, under Apollinic influence. A sacred
                                truce was proclaimed to guarantee the safety of pilgrims to the
                                games, and a heavy fine was imposed on any armed body that should
                                cross the border of Elis in the sacred month. In this peace of God
                                the opposing elements of Greek nationality met and were reconciled.
                                The impulsive Ionian was attuned to the steadier rhythm of the
                                Dorian, and as Greek birth was required of all competitors, the
                                games prepared the way for a Panhellenism which was no sooner found
                                than lost. And yet, despite this Panhellenic character, the games
                                did not entirely lose the local stamp. The Pythian games, for
                                instance, were especially famous for their musical contests, the
                                Isthmian gave the most ample opportunity for commercial exchange.</p>

                                is a token of their favor, and the <foreign lang="xgreek"

                                exaltation of the deity or of some favorite hero. The god, the hero,
                                is often the centre of some myth that occupies the bulk of the poem,
                                and it may seem at the first glance, perhaps after repeated reading,
                                that mere caprice had dictated the choice of this or that myth
                                rather than another, but closer study seldom fails to reveal a
                                deeper meaning in the selection. The myth is often a parallel, often
                                a prototype. Then the scene of the victory is sacred. Its beauties

                                triumph prefigures the trial and triumph of the victor. Then the

                                    of his house.</note>carried the poet up to the higher levels of
                                poetry, for the house was not unfrequently an old heroic line going
                                back into the mythic past. The <foreign lang="xgreek"
                                >epinikion</foreign> is thus lifted up above the mere occasional
                                poem, and we can well understand how such a crown of glory as a
                                Pindaric ode would be carefully preserved and brought forth on each
                                recurrence of the festal day. Such a poem has often for its theme a
                                grand tradition, traditional hospitality, traditional freedom from
                                    <foreign lang="greek">u(/bris</foreign>, that arch-crime against
                                the life of a Greek state, traditional victories. Even when the

                                in brilliancy is gained in human interest. The line disowned of
                                Fortune comes to its rights again. The glory of the grandsire is
                                revived in the third generation. Then there is the victory itself
                                with all the splendor that attends it &mdash; the sacrifices,
                                the processions, the banquets, the songs; and, not least, the songs,
                                for Pindar magnifies his calling, and large space is given to the
                                praise of poetry.</p>
                            <p>From this rapid enumeration of the elements of the <foreign
                                    lang="xgreek">epinikion</foreign>, it will appear that the range
                                is not narrow. There is scope enough for the highest work, as high
                                as the brazen heaven not to be climbed of men, deep as the hell in
                                which &ldquo;you people&rdquo; bear toil and anguish not to
                                be looked at with mortal eye, broad as the family, the house, the
                                race, mankind. And yet the poetry of Pindar does not lose itself in
                                generalities. He compares his song to a bee that hastes from flower
                                to flower, but the bee has a hive. He compares his song to a ship,
                                but the ship has a freight and a port. His song does not fly on and
                                on like a bird of passage. Its flight is the flight of an eagle, to
                                which it has so often been likened, circling the heavens, it is
                                true, stirring the ether, but there is a point on which the eye is
                                bent, a mark, as he says, at which the arrow is aimed. The victory
                                is not forgotten. The <foreign lang="xgreek">epinikion</foreign> is
                                what its name implies. Not a set piece of poetic fire-works, nor
                                yet, as many would make it out to be, a sermon in rhythm. It is a
                                song of praise. But all extravagance of eulogy is repressed by the
                                dread of Nemesis, by that law of <note anchored="yes" place="marg"
                                    >The Epinikion a song of praise.</note>balance which kept the
                                Greek in awe of presumption. The victor may see his image
                                transfigured <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Limits.</note>into
                                the form of hero, or even god; only he is reminded that he is of the
                                earth. <foreign lang="greek">*mh\ ma/teue *zeu\s
                                gene/sqai.</foreign> Sometimes the praise is veiled with the myth,
                                but when it is direct, it is delicate. The victor's garland, he
                                says, demands the song, but the song is not such a trumpet-blast as
                                would blow the garland off the victor's head, if not the victor's
                                head as well. That is modern eulogy. Of course it will be said that
                                Pindar's eulogy was eulogy to order, but it was <pb n="xxvi"/> not
                                falsehood with a cunning makeweight of good advice. The eulogy
                                spends itself where eulogy is earned. To whiten Hieron is easier
                                than to blacken Pindar. The excellence of the victors in the
                                athletic contest, of men like Diagoras, of boys like Agesidamos, the
                                liberality of Theron, of Hieron, of Arkesilas in the chariot-race,
                                are assuredly fit themes for praise. The prosperity of the victor
                                and his house, as a sign of God's favor, might well deserve the
                                commendation of the poet. But Pindar was too high a character to
                                make deliberate merchandise of falsehood, and while it runs counter
                                to commonsense to suppose that he availed himself of his commission
                                to read the high and mighty tyrants of Greece lectures on their
                                moral defects, he is too much a reflection of the Apollo, who is his
                                master, to meddle with lies. With all his faults, Hieron was a Doric
                                prince of whom Dorians needed not to be ashamed, but there is
                                reserve enough in Pindar's praise of a man like Hieron to make us
                                feel the contrast when he comes to Theron. Unfortunately, Pindar is
                                not expected to have humor, and the jest of &ldquo;the hireling
                                Muse&rdquo; and &ldquo;the silvered countenance&rdquo;
                                &mdash; be it &ldquo;of Terpsichore&rdquo; or

                                that his poems were composed for the aristocracy, and that he spoke
                                of them and to them as their peer. No man of the people is praised
                                in his poems. It is the purest fancy that Thrasydaios (P. 11) was
                                other than a man of the highest birth. Now men of aristocratic
                                habits are scrupulously polite to persons of inferior position with
                                whom they may be brought into social contact. Among their own set
                                their manners are less reserved. And Pindar was in his own set when
                                he was among these Olympian and Pythian victors, and there was a
                                strain of familiar banter in his poems that would not have been
                                tolerated or tolerable in any ordinary man. It is not likely that he
                                made an allusion to Psaumis's gray hair (O. 4). If he did, it would
                                pass. It is undeniable that he made a harmless jest at the
                                insignificant <pb n="xxvii"/> appearance of his townsman Melissos
                                (I. 3). When he hints at envy and feud, he has the tone of one who
                                knows all the secrets of a coterie, and when he sorrows, he sorrows
                                as one who has carried the body of a friend to the tomb. If we had

                                </quote> In the transfer to a foreign language the word loses its
                                atmosphere, its associations, its vitality. The angle at which it
                                meets the mental vision is often changed, the rhythm of the sentence
                                is lost. The further one penetrates into the life of a language, the
                                harder does translation become; and so we often have the result that
                                the version of the young student is better than that of the
                                experienced scholar, because the latter tries to express too much,
                                and hence falls into paraphrase and sheer cumbrousness. The true
                                vision of a work of literary art is to be gained by the study of the
                                original, and by that alone. And this holds even as to the ethic
                                value of poetry. To put Pindar's thoughts, his views of life, into
                                other words, is often to sacrifice the delicate point on which the
                                whole moral turns. If this is true of the single word, the single
                                sentence, it holds with still more force of the attempt to form an
                                image of the poet's world of thought and feeling by the simple
                                process of cataloguing translations of <pb n="xxviii"/> his most
                                striking thoughts under certain rubrics. This has been done by
                                various scholars, notably by Bippart and by Buchholz.<note

                                    part.</note> One can give ode and verse for Pindar's belief in
                                blood, in genius, for his contempt of the groundlings, for his
                                tenets of art, of life, of government, if, indeed, we dare break up
                                the antique unity in which all three are merged. But the methodical
                                channels in which Pindar's poetical vein is thus made to run give no
                                notion of the play of the poet's genius. The stream that escapes
                                from the waste-pipe of a fountain gives no notion of the rise and
                                fall and swirl and spray and rainbow glitter of the volume of water
                                that rejoices to return the sportive touch of the sunlight. The
                                catechism has its uses, but it is not the Bible, and as there is no
                                space in this essay for a Pindaric catechism, it must suffice to
                                show how much the study of a few odes will teach us of what Pindar
                                believed concerning God, and what duty he thought God required of
                                man. True, to the great question, &ldquo;What is God?&rdquo;
                                Pindar has no answer in any of his odes; he is as silent as
                                Simonides. But when we ask, &ldquo;Are there more gods than
                                one?&rdquo; the answer comes speedily from the first Olympian,
                                &ldquo;There be gods many and lords many.&rdquo; Zeus

                                Peloponnesos in his embrace, rules the myth. We are reminded of
                                Kronos (<bibl n="Pind. O. 1">v. 10</bibl>); Aphrodite is not

                                    26</bibl>), &mdash; to say nothing of the unfailing Muses
                                (v. 112). We are in the familiar<pb n="xxix"/> world of Greek
                                divinities. The poet's attitude towards the gods is that of his
                                people, and a study of all the odes would only confirm the
                                impression of the first. Nearly every ode is full of gods. Not one
                                of the shining forms of the great divinities is lacking, not even
                                Hestia, who has a large space in N. 11. Pindar's world of the gods
                                is an organized state, won by the victory of Zeus over the Titanic
                                brood. In the first Olympian, as in all the Olympians, Zeus rules
                                serenely. It is true that his throne, Aitna, rests on the violent
                                hundred-headed Typhoeus (<bibl n="Pind. O. 4">O. 4.6</bibl>), but
                                we do not feel the stirrings of the revolted spirit as in <bibl
                                    n="Pind. P. 1">P. 1.15</bibl>, or in <bibl n="Pind. P. 8"
                                    >P. 8.16</bibl>, for the Pythians magnify the office of Apollo,
                                who is the Word of Zeus, the god that bids harmony and measure reign
                                in state and man. The being of Apollo is much more deeply inwrought
                                with the Pythian odes than that of Zeus with the Olympian.</p>
                            <p>This belief in the gods, or acceptance of the gods, did not involve
                                belief in this or that special myth. The historical <note
                                    anchored="yes" place="marg">Mythology.</note>books of the
                                unwritten Bible, so to speak, were open to all manner of scepticism,
                                as we know from the annals of the time, as well as from Pindar.
                                Every one remembers Xenophanes' revolt against the fables of Greek
                                mythology. So, Pindar, in the famous passage, beginning <cit>

                                </cit>, speaks of legends cunningly set off with glittering
                                falsehoods. He distrusts the myth, he resolutely refuses to believe
                                it when it jeopards the honor of God. He who himself invokes Charis
                                for the praise of man, dreads her persuasive power in things divine.
                                &ldquo;I cannot call one of the blessed cannibal.&rdquo;
                                There is a conflict in Pindar's poems on this subject as on others.
                                We of this time know well what this means, for doubt runs through
                                all our literature. Only the antique poet is not tortured by his
                                doubts; the priestly temper conquers. He keeps his tongue from aught
                                that would offend the god, and leaves the god himself to reconcile
                                the partial views of his worshippers. The cultivation of a religious
                                temper is his resource against scepticism, and this age has seen
                                many shining examples of critical knowledge <pb n="xxx"/> held in
                                harmless solution by reverence for the divine. Pindar's criticism,
                                it must be confessed, is of the crudest. His interpretation of the
                                story of the cannibalic meal of the gods is very much in the vein of
                                the most prosaic school of Greek mythologists, and not unlike what
                                we find in early rationalistic criticism of the Biblical narrative.

                                the light that comes from without depends on the favor of God. God

                                has to do with the summits of things, not the foundations. But when

                                the basis of the state, we find that Hieron founded Aitna in honor

                                on God's will, we have a life directed by hereditary usage. The word

                                >no/mos</foreign> is not &ldquo;law&rdquo; to Pindar, it is

                                Is Pindar speaking for himself or for his people? Many of his
                                thoughts are not his own. They are fragments of the popular Hellenic
                                catechism, and they become remarkable in Pindar partly by the mode
                                of presentation, partly by the evident heartiness with which he
                                accepts the national creed. So in <bibl n="Pind. O. 1">v.

                                genealogy which was as popular with the Greeks as <note

                                of bread culminates in overweening insolence and outrage, and brings
                                on itself mischief sent from heaven. That is not Pindar, any more
                                than it is Solon, than it is Theognis, Aischylos. But the genius
                                that stamps these commonplaces into artistic form, that gives to the
                                wisdom of the many the wit of the one, and makes the doctrine a
                                proverb, this was Pindar's, and Pindar's was the believing soul that
                                breathed into the dead dogma the breath of a living and a working
                                faith; and we call that man great who thinks and utters the people's
                                thought best.</p>
                            <p>So it is no new doctrine that he teaches when he insists so much on
                                the corollary of the abhorred genealogy just cited &mdash; the
                                necessity of self-control. Laws are only symptoms, not remedies of
                                disease in the body politic. Whenever crime is rife, legislation is
                                rife, that is all, and the <foreign lang="greek">mhde\n

                                and loudest, on which Pindar preached loudest and oftenest, is the
                                need of self-control. Pindar cares not whether it be the old, old
                                story or not. This negative gospel is the burden of his moralizing.

                                    (<bibl n="Pind. O. 5">O. 5.24</bibl>), or, if that is not
                                Pindar, &ldquo;Seek thou not to become Zeus&rdquo; (I. 4
                                [5], 14). &ldquo;The brazen heavens are not to be
                                mounted,&rdquo; says the moralist of twenty (<bibl

                            <p>Another point also discernible in the first Olympian is the lofty
                                self-consciousness of genius. This Pindar shows in <note
                                    anchored="yes" place="marg">Self-consciousness.</note>all his
                                poems, and strikingly here. His theme is high, but he is level with
                                his high theme. If higher come, he can still ascend. A more glorious
                                victory shall receive a still sweeter song. The arrow shot has
                                reached the lone ether, but the Muse has still her strongest bolt in
                                reserve for him, and in his closing prayer he wishes a lofty career
                                for Hieron, and side by side with the prince let the poet stand,
                                    <foreign lang="greek">pro/fanton sofi/a| kaq' *(/ellanas e)o/nta
                                    panta=|</foreign>. The proud self-assertion is hardly veiled by
                                the prayer. In the second Olympian there is the same maintenance of
                                high pretension. In the first Olympian it is the Muse that keeps her
                                strongest bolt in reserve. In the second it is the poet himself that
                                keeps his arrow within his quiver (v. 92). He seems, as has been
                                said, to rise to the stature of Apollo himself in his proud scorn of
                                the Python brood. How, then, is this to be reconciled with the
                                self-control, the freedom from boasting, which Hellenic ethic
                                enjoins? It is because of the source of genius &mdash; God
                                himself. Pindar looks down on lesser poets as eagles <pb n="xxxiii"
                                /> on ravens (<bibl n="Pind. O. 2">O. 2.96</bibl>), on daws
                                    (<bibl n="Pind. N. 3">N. 3.82</bibl>). Contempt, scorn,
                                superciliousness are hardly the words. It is a sublime looking over
                                the heads of his rivals with at most a faint consciousness of their
                                cawing far below. This is a dangerous assumption, an attitude that
                                may be nothing but a posture, and we resent it in inferior poets,
                                who take on Pindaric airs. But Pindar at his greatest height does
                                not forget by whom he is borne up, the limits of his god-given
                                power. <cit>

                                Pindar cultivated a choice garden of the Graces, it is by a skill
                                that Fate has allotted him (<bibl n="Pind. O. 9">O. 9.27</bibl>).
                                If men are good and wise, it is in accordance with a <foreign
                                    lang="greek">dai/mwn</foreign> (v. 28), and as if never weary of
                                the theme, he comes back to it in v. 100. Again it sounds forth in
                                    <bibl n="Pind. O. 11">O. 11 (10), 10</bibl>: &ldquo;wisdom

                                it must come from God (<bibl n="Pind. P. 11">P. 11.50</bibl>).
                                Part and parcel of this belief in nature, in God, is his belief in
                                heredity. This comes out more crudely, as might be expected, in his
                                earliest poem &mdash; which is an arrangement in God and Blood
                                (P. 10), but it is no less fundamental in that which some consider
                                his latest (P. 8), when he intimates, not obscurely, that the hope
                                of Aigina rests on the transmitted virtues of her noble stock.</p>
                            <p>Pindar has been called a Pythagorean, but this is saying nothing more
                                than that he shared with Pythagoras the <note anchored="yes"

                                immortality of the soul, which had its main support in the Delphic
                                oracle and in the Pythian temple. The symbolism of this <pb
                                    n="xxxiv"/> belief is found everywhere in Greek religion,
                                especially in the Bacchic cycle, and in the mysteries of the Twain
                                Deities, Demeter and Persephone. The second Olympian shows his creed
                                in part as to the future world.<note anchored="yes" n="1">See note

                                may be noted, is of a piece with the aristocratic character of his

                                Bad, in the Doric sense, not a system of revenges for the inequality
                                of present fortune, as too many consider it. The grave is not all
                                silence to Pindar; the ghost of sound, Echo, may visit the abode of
                                the dead, and bear glad tidings to those who have gone before (<bibl
                                    n="Pind. O. 14">O. 14.21</bibl>). Immortality has not been
                                brought to light, but the feeling hand of the poet has found it in
                                the darkness of Persephone's home.</p>

                                self-assertion, he vindicates his rank as a poet just as he would
                                vindicate his rank as an aristocrat. He is an eagle, his rivals are

                                sometimes a strong bolt is kept in reserve by the Muse, for Pindar,
                                as an aristocrat, is a man of reserves. Of the richness of his
                                workmanship none is better aware than he. The work of the poet is a
                                Daedalian work, and the sinuous folds are wrought with rare skill

                                treatment. Now how far does Pindar's account of himself correspond
                                to the actual impression? What is the immediate effect of the
                                detailed work of his poems, that detailed work by which he is at
                                first more comprehensible? The detail of Pindar's odes produces,
                                from the very outset of the study, an irresistible effect of
                                opulence and elevation. Opulence is wealth that makes itself felt,
                                that suggests, al<note anchored="yes" place="marg"

                                indigence. It is one half of an aristocrat, elevation being the
                                other, so that in art as in thought, as in politics, as in religion,
                                Pindar is true to his birth and to his order. This opulence, this
                                abundance of resource, shows itself in strength and in splendor, for
                                    <foreign lang="greek">plou=tos</foreign> is <foreign

                                its synonyms seem to be made for Pindar. He drains dry the Greek
                                vocabulary of words for light and bright, shine and shimmer, glitter
                                and glister, ray and radiance, flame and flare and flash, gleam and
                                glow, burn and blaze. The first Olympian begins with wealth and
                                strength, with flaming fire of gold, and the shining star of <pb
                                    n="xxxvii"/> the sun. The fame of Hieron is resplendent, and the
                                shoulder of Pelops gleams. No light like the light of the eye,
                                thought the Greek, and the ancestors of Theron were the eye of
                                Sicily, and Adrastos longs for the missing eye of his army. So the
                                midmonth moon in her golden chariot flashed full the eye of evening
                                into the face of Herakles. Wealth is not enough. It must be picked
                                out, set off. It is not the uniform stare of a metallic surface, it
                                must be adorned with the tracery that heightens the value of the
                                background. Pindar delights in elaboration. His <foreign

                                flame of the lights, such the sweet din and rumble and roar of the
                                music of earth and the music of heaven, that the poet himself,
                                overcome by the resources of his own art, confesses his defeat, and
                                by one strong impulse of his light feet, swims out of the deluge of

                                    </cit>. How any one can consider <foreign lang="greek"
                                    >a)/na</foreign> to mean &ldquo;Lord,&rdquo; in this
                                    passage, is to me as yet a mystery.</note> It requires strength
                                to carry this opulence of splendor, but Pindar's opulence is the
                                opulence of strength as well. He does not carve his bow with curious
                                figures so deeply cut that at the drawing of the string the weapon
                                snaps. His is not a sleepy but a vivid opulence, not a lazy but a
                                swift opulence. Everything lives in his poems, everything is
                                personified. Look at the magical way in which he lights up this
                                great lamp of the architecture of his Odeon in the first Pythian.
                                &ldquo;O Golden Lyre, joint heirloom of Apollo and the Muses <pb
                                    n="xxxviii"/> violet-tressed, thou for whom the step, the
                                dancer's step, listeneth.&rdquo; &ldquo;Obeyeth&rdquo;
                                seems too faint. We see the foot poised, tremulously listening for
                                the notes of the phorminx, as if it had a hearing of its own. A few
                                verses further down, &ldquo;snowy Aitna, nursing the livelong
                                year the biting snow,&rdquo; not &ldquo;<emph>her</emph>
                                snow,&rdquo; as it has been rendered. It is not hers. It has
                                come down to her from Heaven. It is the child of Zeus, and only
                                rests on her cold bosom, the pillar of the sky. Yet again the couch
                                on which the fettered giant lies goads him and galls him, as if it
                                too had a spite against him, as well as the weight of continent and
                                island that pinches his hairy breast. And so it is everywhere; and
                                while this vividness in some instances is faint to us, because our
                                language uses the same personifications familiarly, we must remember
                                that to the Greek they were new, or, at all events, had not entirely
                                lost their saliency by frequent attrition.</p>
                            <p>Swiftness is a manifestation of strength, and Pindar is swift and a
                                lover of swiftness, to judge by his imagery. <note anchored="yes"
                                    place="marg">Swiftness.</note>Swiftness we readily recognize in
                                plan, in narrative. In detail work it goes by another name,
                                concentration &mdash; the gathering of energy to a point, a
                                summing up of vitality in a word. It is the certainty with which
                                Pindar comes down on his object that gives so much animation, so
                                much strength, so much swiftness to his style. A word, an epithet,
                                and the picture is there, drawn with a stroke. In the second
                                Olympian he is telling of the blessedness of the souls that have
                                overcome. When he comes to the damned, he calls them simply
                                &ldquo;those.&rdquo; &ldquo;The others bear anguish too
                                great for eye to look at.&rdquo; <foreign lang="it">Non
                                    ragioniam di lor.</foreign> In the same wonderful second
                                Olympian he says, &ldquo;Liveth among the Olympians she that was
                                slain by the rumble of the thunder, longhaired Semele.&rdquo;
                                Semele died not &ldquo;amid,&rdquo; but
                                &ldquo;by&rdquo; the roar. &ldquo;Killed with
                                report.&rdquo; The roar was enough to destroy that gentle life,
                                and the untranslatable <foreign lang="greek">tanue/qeira</foreign>
                                gives at once the crown of her womanhood, the crown of her beauty,
                                the crown of her suffering. Semele lives again as she appeared to
                                Zeus, when he visited her with immortal terrors. <pb n="xxxix"/></p>
                            <p>The aristocrat must be rich, must be strong. A man may be both and
                                yet be vulgar, for there is a vulgar beauty, a vulgar genius. The
                                second characteristic of Pindar is elevation. This word is preferred
                                to sublimity, because sublimity is absolute, and is incompatible
                                with the handling of any but the <note anchored="yes" place="marg"
                                    >Elevation.</note>highest themes. Elevation is relative. You may
                                treat a thing loftily without treating it sublimely. Pindar is not
                                always in the altitudes, though he loves &ldquo;the lone bosom
                                of the cold ether,&rdquo; and the fruits that grow on the
                                topmost branches of the tree of virtue, nearest the sun, and the
                                lofty paths along which the victors of Olympia walk. He is not
                                lacking in sportiveness, but whatever he treats, he treats with the
                                reserve of a gentleman, a term which is no anachronism when applied
                                to him. Hence his exquisite purity. &ldquo;Secret are wise
                                Suasion's keys unto Love's sanctities&rdquo; he sings himself,
                                and amid the palpitating beauties of Greek mythology he never
                                forgets the lesson that he puts in the mouth of the Centaur (<bibl
                                    n="Pind. P. 9">P. 9.42</bibl>). The opulence, strength,
                                swiftness, elevation, of Pindar's art reveal themselves in varying
                                proportions in the various odes. Noteworthy for its opulence is the
                                seventh Olympian, for Diagoras of Rhodes, the famous boxer, which
                                the Rhodians copied in letters of gold, and dedicated in the temple
                                of Athena at Lindos. What stately magnificence in the famous
                                forefront of the sixth Olympian, in which he sets up the golden
                                pillars of his porch of song. What vividness in his immortal
                                description of the power of music in the first Pythian. Gray's
                                imitation is well known: <quote lang="en">

                            <p>Of the various elements that go to make up this total impression of
                                opulence and elevation, some will be considered hereafter. Something
                                will be said of the effect of the rhythms, something of the
                                opalescent variety of the dialect, of the high relief of the syntax,
                                of the cunning workmanship that manifests itself in the order of the
                                words. Let us now turn to a closer consideration of that which first
                                attracts attention in an author, the vocabulary. Much might be said
                                of <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Vocabulary-Compounds.</note>the

                                be certain that such and such a word is Pindar's own, but that he
                                was an audacious builder of new words<note anchored="yes" n="2">

                                <pb n="xlii"/> In the fine feeling of language few poets can vie
                                with Pindar; and though he is no pedantic synonym-monger, like a
                                true artist he delights in the play of his own work. There is danger
                                of over-subtilty in the study of antique style; but Pindar is a
                                jeweller, his material gold and ivory, and his chryselephantine work
                                challenges the scrutiny of the microscope, invites the study that
                                wearies not day or night in exploring the recesses in which the
                                artist has held his art sequestered &mdash; invites the study
                                and rewards it. Pindar himself has made <foreign lang="greek"
                                    >fwna/enta sunetoi=sin</foreign> (<bibl n="Pind. O. 2">O.
                                    2.93</bibl>) a common saying; Pindar himself speaks of his art
                                as <foreign lang="greek">a)koa\ sofoi=s</foreign> (<bibl
                                    n="Pind. P. 9">P. 9.84</bibl>); his call across the centuries
                                is to the lovers of art as art. There is an aristocratic disdain in
                                his nature that yields only to kindred spirits or to faithful
                                service.</p>
                            <p>The formal leisurely comparison Pindar seldom employs, though he uses
                                it with special effect in the stately openings <note anchored="yes"

                                6 and O. 7. In O. 12 the comparison takes the place of the myth, and
                                others are found here and there. But instead of
                                &ldquo;as&rdquo; he prefers the implied comparison, which is
                                conveyed by parallel structure such as we find in the beginning of
                                O. 1, of O. 10 (11). In the metaphor, with its bold identification
                                of object and image, Pindar abounds as few poets abound. Every realm
                                of nature, every sphere of human life, is laid under contribution.

                                called mixed is not so large in Pindar as is supposed;<note

                                mixed metaphor a rapid shifting of metaphors. This is to be expected
                                in the swift movement of Pindar's genius. The disjointedness of
                                Emerson's style has been ingeniously defended on the ground that
                                each sentence is a chapter. And so Pindar's metaphors are slides
                                that come out in such quick succession that the figures seem to
                                blend because the untrained eye cannot follow the rapid movement of
                                the artist. A notorious passage occurs in the first Pythian (<bibl
                                    n="Pind. P. 1">v. 86 foll.</bibl>), in which Pindar touches
                                in quick succession various strings. &ldquo;Let not fair chances
                                slip. Guide thy host with a just helm. Forge thy tongue on an
                                unlying anvil. If it so chance that ought of import light escapes
                                thee, it becomes of magnitude in that it comes from thee. Of many
                                things thou art steward. Many witnesses are there to deeds of both
                                kinds,&rdquo; and so on, with a shift in every sentence. In such
                                passages the absence of conjunctions is sufficient to show that no
                                connection was aimed at, and it is the fault of the reader if he
                                chooses to complain of an incongruous blending of things that are
                                left apart.</p>
                            <p>The next point to be considered is the plan of the <foreign

                                Pindar was under the domination of <note anchored="yes" place="marg"
                                    >Plan of the Epinikion.</note>the tradition of his department,
                                and the fragments of Simonides are enough to show that there was a
                                general method of handling the theme common to all the poets. The
                                    <foreign lang="xgreek">epinikion</foreign> is, as we have seen,
                                an occasional poem. The problem is to raise it out of this position,
                                as a mere temporary adornment of the victory, to a creation of
                                abiding worth. The general method must have been reached before
                                Pindar's time; it is his success in execution that has to be
                                considered here. The <foreign lang="xgreek">epinikion</foreign> has
                                for its basis the fact and the individual; but it rises through the
                                real to the ideal, through the individual to the universal. The
                                light that shines about the victor's head brightens into the light
                                of eternity; <pb n="xlv"/> the leaf of olive or of laurel becomes a
                                wreath of amaranth. Sheer realism had no place in high Greek art.
                                The statues of the victors in Olympia were not portrait statues.
                                When the victor had overcome three times, then, it is true, he might
                                set up a portrait statue, but three victories of themselves would
                                idealize. The transfiguration which we expect of heaven the Greek
                                sought in art. So the victor and the victory are not described at
                                length. True, the poet sometimes labored under the frightful
                                disadvantage of a commission that dictated an enumeration of all the
                                prizes gained by a certain family. How gracefully, how lightly, he
                                acquitted himself of the task may be seen in O. 7, in O. 13. But
                                apart from such special restrictions &mdash; under which
                                everything spiritual and artistic must groan, being burdened, in
                                this travailing world &mdash; the poet was free to conceive his
                                subject ideally. The special occasion secured interest and sympathy
                                in advance, gave him the broad earth from which to rise; and not the
                                proudest eagle that ever soared, if once on the earth, can rise
                                without running, though it be but for a little distance, along its
                                black surface: and the <foreign lang="xgreek">epinikion</foreign>
                                started on the earth. Now change the figure after the Pindaric
                                fashion to the temple &mdash; Pindar himself has suggested the
                                comparison (<bibl n="Pind. O. 6">O. 6.1</bibl>) &mdash; some
                                fair Greek temple, repeating the proportions of the clear-cut
                                mountains of Greece just as the Gothic cathedral repeats the forests
                                of Germany; some temple standing on the large level of an acropolis,
                                standing against the sky. The fa&ccedil;ade of the work is to be
                                illuminated, but not so as to throw a garish light on every detail.
                                Only the salient points are to be brought out, only the
                                characteristic outline, so that as it comes out against the dark sky
                                you seem to have one constellation more. Nay, the new constellation
                                is strangely blended with the old groups of stars, and we cannot
                                tell which is mythic past, which illuminated present.</p>
                            <p>The sources of the myth have already been indicated. The <note
                                    anchored="yes" place="marg">The myth.</note>selection is often
                                suggested by external relations. Now it is the victor's family that
                                furnishes the story, now the victor's home, now the scene of the
                                contest and the <pb n="xlvi"/> presiding god or hero. Sometimes the
                                selection is due to internal motives, and the myth is a model, a
                                parallel, or a prophecy &mdash; perhaps all three. This, then,
                                is the function of the myth in the <foreign lang="xgreek"
                                >epinikion</foreign>, the idealization of the present, the
                                transfiguration of the real. This was an artistic necessity for the
                                Greek, and it was in some sort an historical necessity. It
                                reconciled epic and lyric. It gave a new value to epic themes by
                                using them as parallels for the present, while the drama took the
                                last step and made the past the present.</p>
                            <p>Pindar does not jumble his materials in admired disorder, nor does he
                                sort them after the approved scientific fashion, with subdivision
                                after subdivision, to the exhaustion of all the letters of the
                                alphabet, Roman, italic, Greek, and Hebrew. Analysis does not show
                                the way in which the poem was woven. The fruitful study of Pindar
                                lies through synthesis, <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Symmetry
                                    in Pindar.</note>not through analysis, and in the introductions
                                to the several odes an effort has been made to show how the meaning
                                of the whole reveals itself to him who simply follows the poet's
                                guidance. What is dignified by the name of an analysis is often
                                nothing more than a table of contents, a catalogue, the very form of
                                which disguises the lack of connection. Logical disposition will not
                                avail much. Pindar is poetical, not logical. But symmetry there must
                                be, for it is impossible for any one that studies Greek literary art
                                not to count on symmetry. The tendency to balance, to parallelism,
                                is universal. In Greek the tendency is a law. It is needless to
                                enlarge on this. The law of correspondence &mdash; measure
                                answering to measure &mdash; is fundamental, and has been
                                applied to every sphere of Greek art &mdash; pictorial, plastic,
                                literary &mdash; not without overstraining, yet not without
                                great profit. In music as in architecture it is unquestioned. Even
                                frivolous Offenbach has said: &ldquo;Music is an
                                algebra.&rdquo; Poetry, like music, is made up of equations.</p>
                            <p>In Pindar the symmetry of form is evident. The odes <note
                                    anchored="yes" place="marg">Symmetry of form.</note>are composed
                                either of corresponding strophes or of corresponding triads
                                (strophe, antistrophe, and epode). But this is not enough. There
                                must be within each <pb n="xlvii"/> strophe, each epode, another
                                balance, another correspondence, another symmetry. Westphal first
                                distinctly postulated this correspondence, and opened the way for
                                the establishment of it; but the bold and brilliant originator
                                wearied of his own work, renounced his own principles. J. H.
                                Heinrich Schmidt began his metrical and rhythmical studies as a
                                worker on the lines laid down by Westphal, although he differs from
                                his forerunner at every turn; and Moriz Schmidt,<note anchored="yes"

                            <p>Moriz Schmidt (p. 71) pronounces both wrong, and constructs a
                                different scheme: <table>

                            <p>It will be observed that the number of bars in Rossbach-Westphal and
                                in J. H. H. Schmidt is the same. In Moriz Schmidt, owing to the
                                greater range he allows himself in the use of <foreign lang="greek"
                                    >tonh/</foreign> and pause &mdash; the power of prolonging
                                and the power of resting &mdash; the number is slightly
                                increased. He has fifty-six against fifty-three. But the other
                                differences are graver. Still, whether we accept the short periods
                                or the long, the recognition of some principle of symmetry cannot be
                                withheld. These choral structures were made not only to balance each
                                other, but also to balance themselves.</p>
                            <p>So much for symmetry of form. Is there any corresponding <pb

                                not only in form, but to a certain degree in sense. Are we to
                                renounce this in Pindar? Does the development of the ode go its own
                                way regardless of the form? This has been practically the conclusion
                                of the editors of Pindar from Erasmus Schmid, with his formidable
                                rhetorical analysis of the odes, down to Mezger, with his

                                says Mezger in substance, composed his poems for oral delivery, and
                                consequently wished to be understood at once. But even to his
                                contemporaries, in spite of all their advantages, the immediate
                                comprehension of his poems would have been impossible if they had
                                not had some outside help. Of these extraneous aids, three, melody,
                                musical accompaniment, and dance, are lost for us irrecoverably. But
                                there was a tradition, a fixed norm for such compositions, a
                                    <foreign lang="greek">teqmo/s</foreign> from which the <foreign

                                    lang="greek">teqmo/s</foreign> not only for the contents, but
                                also for the form. To be sure, the old interpreters in their
                                blindness knew nothing of this; but B&ouml;ckh and Dissen
                                observed <pb n="xlix"/> certain laws of structure, certain
                                recurrences, certain symmetrical responses. Thiersch proved the
                                triple division <foreign lang="greek">prokw/mion, me/son tou=
                                    a)/|smatos, e)pikw/mion</foreign>: but it was reserved for
                                Westphal to set forth and establish the proposition that Aischylos,
                                in the composition of his choruses, and Pindar, in that of his
                                    <foreign lang="xgreek">epinikia</foreign>, followed the <foreign
                                    lang="greek">no/mos</foreign> of Terpander with its sevenfold
                                division. This Mezger considers Westphal to have made evident for
                                all the forty-four odes except eight, at least so far as the three
                                principal parts are concerned; and these principal parts are
                                &mdash; beginning, middle, and end. But the establishment of
                                these principal parts does not carry us beyond Thiersch. What we

                            <p>Westphal himself seems to feel that the lover of Pindar will rebel
                                against the thought that the great poet wrought according to a mere
                                mechanical formula; but the Pindaric scholars that have followed
                                Westphal seem to have no such scruples. The mystic and Delphic
                                    <foreign lang="greek">o)mfalo/s</foreign> exercises on them a

                                and there is an undeniable charm about the scheme. The three certain
                                parts are beginning, middle, and end, and for these we have the high
                                authority of Aristotle (Poet. c. 7). The seven normal parts remind
                                one of the seven parts of the comic <foreign lang="xgreek"
                                >parabasis</foreign>, and as the seven parts of the parabasis are

                                noticed the frequent recurrence of the same word, or close
                                equivalent, in the corresponding parts of strophe and antistrophe,
                                epode and epode. These recurrent words are all significant, all mark
                                transitions, and were all intended as cues to aid the memory of the

                            <p>True, it may be said that the inner organism of a Pindaric ode need
                                not correspond to the outer form, and that the five triads of the
                                third Pythian may be chopped up into seven <pb n="lii"/> Terpandrian
                                parts &mdash; chopped up, for the knife does not come down on
                                the rhythmical joints. But where shall we find anything like this in
                                Greek literature? The further we penetrate into Greek poetry, the
                                greater reason have we to acknowledge the reign of symmetry.
                                Violation of symmetry, of correspondence, may be referred in every
                                instance either to defective tradition or to designed disturbance.
                                As in Greek architecture, so in Greek poetry, departures from
                                symmetry are not only suffered, but enjoined, for the sake of a
                                higher symmetrical effect, for the maintenance of the feeling of
                                life. The straight line of mechanics becomes the curved line of art.
                                The entasis of the Doric column, the flexure of the Doric stylobate,
                                are familiar illustrations of the law of visual effect. The Greek
                                artist had regard to the position that his work was to occupy, to
                                the angle in which it would present itself to the eye of the
                                beholder. So in Greek poetry we must consider the law of higher
                                symmetry, the principle of artistic unity, the calculated effect on
                                the hearer &mdash; and we must remember that we have to do with
                                the hearer, not with the reader. <foreign lang="greek"
                                >*stixomuqi/a</foreign> is well, but when passionate utterance gives
                                two verses the time of one, we must not heedlessly apply the knife
                                because the passage looks out of balance. But these interferences
                                apart, we expect a symmetry in contents corresponding to symmetry in
                                form, and we cannot admit a logical division which shall ruthlessly
                                run across all the lines of the artistic structure. We must seek the
                                symmetry of thought, where the symmetry of the form is revealed, in
                                strophe, in triad. Each strophe has its office, each triad its
                                function. The only concessions that must be made to logical
                                distribution are those that must be made in the same department of
                                art. We must simply allow the strophe and the triad the same play

                                    matters, I am more desirous of thinking a right thought than a
                                    new one. As I have not gone into the question of the relation of
                                    strophe to antistrophe and epode, I would add here that J. H. H.
                                    SCHMIDT, in his <title lang="de">Kunstformen</title> (III. p.
                                    350), has shown that Pindar has paused about twice as often at
                                    the end of the strophe as at the end of the antistrophe. The
                                    object of this, as Schmidt thinks, is to break up the mechanical
                                    balance of strophe and antistrophe, or, as he puts it, A + (A+B)
                                    is more common than A + A + (B). This is, of course, a
                                    reinforcement of the position taken here.</note>

                                    <title lang="la">De dispositione partium,</title> Dissen has
                                treated at length the arrangement of the elements of the <foreign

                                interweaving of the parts. &ldquo;With the exception of the very
                                short pieces,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;all Pindar's odes have
                                at least two parts besides the prooemium,&rdquo; and Dissen has
                                interested himself in showing how the poet prepares his theme,
                                interposes a myth, and then returns to his theme, and how from the
                                simple arrangements <term>aba</term> and <term>abab</term>, the poet
                                advances to <term>abaca</term>, <term>ababa</term>,
                                <term>abcba</term>, <term>abcbda</term>, <term>abacbc</term>,
                                    <term>abcbab</term>, <term>abcadc</term>, and the crowning
                                glory, <term>abcdcda</term>.</p>
                            <p>There is, of course, an element of truth in these recurrences. There
                                is a cyclical movement in many of the Pindaric odes. The myth is
                                usually belted by the praise of the victor and the victor's home,
                                but it is impossible to accept an elaborately systematic arrangement
                                of the subject within the symmetrical structure of the rhythm and
                                independent of it. Dyads and triads there are in Pindar, but they do
                                not disturb the rhythmical working of the odes; and Dissen often
                                elevates to the rank of an organic part what has been brought in
                                simply as a foil. According to him everything in Pindar must have a
                                deep significance, an independent value, a special allusion, whereas
                                much is put there for the sake of heightening the effect by
                                contrast. <pb n="liv"/></p>
                            <p>Dissen has gone through all the odes and reduced them to schemes, for

                                wealth of fancy. It cannot be said of him that he is indifferent to
                                the claims of symmetry. To him the Pindaric odes are so many
                                temples, and he sees ground-plans and elevations, and rows of
                                columns, and groups of figures in the rhythmical structures of
                                Pindar. Most persons will consider Furtw&auml;ngler's book a
                                waste of fancy and ingenuity, and yet it has not been written all in
                                vain. Temple and ode are both built on a plan, both obey the laws of
                                symmetry, and so one may serve to illustrate the other. But the
                                manifestations are different. The temple is to be devel oped from
                                the cell, the ode from the rhythm. Regard the ode as a great verse
                                and much of the difficulty in finding symmetry in the Pindaric poems
                                will disappear.</p>
                            <p>The verse, as a rhythmical structure, is made up of verse-feet; the
                                verse, as a logical unit, is made up of word-feet. The coincidence
                                and the discrepancy of verse-foot and word-foot constitute
                                respectively <term>diaeresis</term> and <term>caesura</term>, if,
                                indeed, one may be allowed to use this nomenclature, which certainly
                                has its convenience.</p>
                            <p>Now a verse in which verse-foot and word-foot should coincide
                                throughout as in the famous <quote lang="la">sparsis &verbar;
                                    hastis &verbar; longis &verbar; campus &verbar;
                                    splendet et &verbar; horret</quote> of Ennius would lack
                                unity, and a succession of them would be intolerably monotonous.
                                Hence the office of caesura to effect unity by dividing a word
                                between two feet and so to force a more energetic recitation.
                                Diaeresis serves to distribute the masses, caesura to unite them.</p>
                            <p>Of course where the masses are so large as in the Pindaric odes there
                                is not the same danger of monotony. Each triad might present a
                                complete whole. In fact each strophe, each antistrophe, each epode,
                                might be rounded off as a separate element without much offence. But
                                the Greek sense of unity <pb n="lv"/> demanded a less mechanical
                                distribution, and the parts of each ode often fit into each other as
                                the parts of an hexameter or a trimeter. The preparation, as Dissen
                                would call it, does not count, nor does the connection. The body of
                                the thought falls within the limits; that is enough. The study of
                                the Pindaric odes suggests the lines of color used in maps to
                                designate boundaries. The eye is not offended by the excurrence
                                there nor the mind by the excurrence here. Making this allowance
                                then, and suffering the sense to bind strophes and triads together
                                while the dominant themes of strophes and triads are distinct, we
                                shall find no insuperable difficulty in establishing simple and easy
                                proportions for most of the Pindaric poems. Problems there will
                                always be, and bold would be the man who should maintain that he had
                                said the last word on such a theme.</p>

                                In O. 11 (10) the antithetical structure runs through strophe,
                                antistrophe, and epode, but each member revolves about a separate

                                poem, O. 14, is suspicious, and cannot be cited to prove that two
                                triads would give ample room. If we are to have introduction, myth,
                                and conclusion, it would be hard to distribute them properly through
                                two triads. Three triads give a natural division, and so we find
                                that it is used nearly as often as five, though the number five
                                suggests a better proportion logically. Each triad has its dominant
                                theme. O. 5 occupies an exceptional position among the Pindaric
                                poems, but the distribution forms no exception. There is no
                                overlapping in it.</p>
                            <p>Four triads are used as often as three. There is no mechanical
                                uniformity, but, as we should expect, the introduction usually
                                dominates one triad, the myth two, the conclusion one, in most of
                                the odes. This is the type 1. 2. 1. Overlapping is the rule
                                    <term>(1.(2).1)</term> or <term>(1.2).1</term> or
                                <term>1.(2.1)</term>. In Pindar's earliest piece, P. 10, there is no
                                overlapping, and the student of English versification is reminded of
                                the early timidity of blank verse.</p>
                            <p>Five triads might be expected to distribute themselves thus:
                                Introduction = 1, Myth = 3, Conclusion = 1, and this is
                                substantially the arrangement in most of them. P. 8, with 2. 1. 2,
                                forms an interesting exception, for which the notes must be
                                consulted, as well as for the arrangement in O. 13, and P. 1, which
                                have a quasi-epodic structure, two triads representing strophe, two
                                antistrophe, and one epode. P. 3 and P. 9 are thrown out of line by
                                the position of the myth.</p>
                            <p>In the Fourth Pythian we have no less than thirteen triads, and it
                                might seem at first as if the epic mass had crushed the lyric
                                proportion. But when we examine the structure more closely, we find
                                that the first three triads form the overture, if I may say so. It
                                is a prelude which gives the <term>motif</term> of the piece. These
                                three triads are followed by seven triads with the story of the
                                Argonauts in detail, while the conclusion is prepared and
                                consummated in the last three triads. It is true <pb n="lvii"/> that
                                the mass of the story carries it on into the eleventh triad, but the
                                grand scale prepares us for a wider aberration.</p>
                            <p>Of the strophic poems, O. 14 has already been considered. In P. 12 we
                                recognize the familiar distribution 1. 2. 1. P. 6 is represented by
                                2. 2. 2.</p>
                            <p>In N. 2 there is a curious iteration of the name of the victor and
                                his family, <term>(1.1) + (1.1)</term>. The twelve strophes of N. 4
                                divide into 3. 6. 3, the eleven of N. 9 into 2. 7. 2. I. 7 has not
                                yielded satisfactory results.</p>
                            <p>To those who must have sharp figures at any cost, these statements
                                will be disappointing; but the exact symmetry is cared for in the
                                rhythm, the metre. All that we could fairly expect here is a general
                                balance.</p>

                            <head>Development through his career</head>
                            <p>In the preceding glimpses of Pindar's thought and art, his poems have
                                been treated as a whole, and no regard has been had to the gradual
                                development of his powers. If his career exhibited marked stages, if
                                we had trustworthy external data, such a presentation might well be
                                considered defective. Sophokles and Euripides would not fare thus,
                                nor Plato, although it must be confessed that Plato is a warning
                                against the rash application of the principle of development. Let us
                                see how the case stands with Pindar.</p>
                            <p>The life of Pindar gives scarcely any clue to his development. After
                                his encounter with Korinna there is almost a dead silence from
                                without. Those who have ears to hear &mdash; and every modern
                                critic is a Fine-ear &mdash; may detect the sound of growth from
                                within. Besides, we have the advantage of a certain number of fixed
                                points. We know the dates of a fair proportion of Pindar's
                                forty-four odes, and we may construct the curve of his rise, and, if
                                it must be said, of his decline. The department, too, seems to favor
                                such a study, for Pindar was a lyric poet; and a lyric poet, it is
                                thought, would be the first to show the traces of personal
                                experience. But antique lyric is not modern lyric. Even Roman lyric
                                is not Greek lyric. The Horace of the Odes is not the same as the
                                Horace of the <pb n="lviii"/> Epodes; but it does not follow
                                irresistibly that we can as easily distinguish between the Pindar of
                                the tenth Pythian and the Pindar of the fourth Olympian. It may be
                                going too far to say that the law of the department, the lyric
                                    <foreign lang="greek">teqmo/s</foreign>, was so much stronger
                                than the individual that the personal development does not count.
                                The personal development does count, and it is a legitimate and
                                fascinating study, but the danger of importing into the result
                                    <foreign lang="la">a priori</foreign> conclusions is manifest.
                                Once fix in the mind the characteristic stages, and the inevitable
                                tendency is to force the phenomena, no matter how stubborn they may
                                be, into the places which they are supposed to fit. Of youth we
                                expect exuberance of language, unassimilated wealth of thought,
                                rashness of imagery, a technic that betrays, both by its mechanical
                                adherence to rule and by its violation of principle, the recent
                                influence of the school, and the rebellion against it. Of matured
                                power we expect a balance of forces; the imagination is steadier,
                                the thought deeper, the interpenetration of form and matter is more
                                complete, the plan is organic, the poem grows symmetrically up to
                                its full height; there are fewer surprises, and the technic has
                                become a second nature without the dulness of routine. The man is at
                                his best. The closing stage shows perfect mastery of form still, but
                                the effects are produced with less expenditure of power, there is
                                not the same joy of surplus vitality, the word
                                &ldquo;dexterity&rdquo; comes in too often when we applaud,
                                the plan is a scheme. Now while some such course may be laid down in
                                general for the track of lyric genius, the very essence of genius,
                                which is the unforeseen, disappoints calculation at every turn.
                                There are some minds in which there is no trace of crudeness at any
                                age. There are revivals of youth in poetry as in life, revivals that
                                scandalize critics of art as well as critics of morals. Of all

                                immaturity is too long, and the evidence of immaturity too slight.
                                The great poets of the world do not wait until the Suabian age of
                                discretion &mdash; which is forty &mdash; before they reach
                                their prime. Of the seven dated poems assigned to this period three
                                are on the border of Pindar's perfect art, so that we are
                                practically left to make up our characteristics of this stadium from
                                P. 10, 6, 12, and 7. We are told that Pindar's first commissions
                                came from Thebes. Nothing would seem to be more likely. But the odes
                                give no evidence of it. The Thebans may have employed him at their
                                local games, but the victors of the earlier odes are from Thessaly,
                                Akragas, Athens, Epizephyrian Lokris, and Aigina. We are told that
                                Pindar must have known Aigina from his youth up, and no one
                                questions his intimate knowledge of the island, his deep interest in
                                its fortunes. One fourth of all the odes celebrate Aiginetans, but
                                the first Aiginetan ode is the last of this period of immaturity.
                                True, not without significance is the close connection with Delphi
                                and the consequent predominance of Pythian odes at this period, and
                                it was doubtless a proud moment in the poet's life when he received
                                his first Olympian commission, and if the longer ode on Agesidamos,
                                O. 10 (11), is the fulfilment of that commission, it may be
                                pardonable to see a certain jubilation in its tone; but it is
                                extravagant to attempt the reconciliation between the joyous tone
                                and the long delay by the supposition that the poet was too much
                                overcome by his emotion to do the theme immediate justice. The
                                distinction between the earlier poems and the poems of the period of
                                maturity, as marked by the prominence given to the grace of a
                                special god in the latter, seems to be shadowy, and to have less in
                                its favor than the criticism that there is a lack of unity in the
                                composition of the earlier poems. <pb n="lx"/> Unfortunately the
                                relation of myth to theme is not yet put on an impregnable basis,
                                and what Schmidt says of the earlier poems has been said by others
                                of the ripest. It is easy to say that there is no interpenetration
                                of myth and thought, that the actual present is not yet merged in
                                the mythic past, that we have only striking situations, no
                                development, and hence no psychological interest. The trouble is to
                                vindicate perfection for the others. The handling of the metres in
                                the different periods is another matter that leaves ample margin for
                                varying judgment. Schmidt maintains that the metre shifts from
                                logaoedic to dactylo-epitrite without discernible reason, that the
                                logaoedic is more freely handled as the poet develops, and that the
                                dactylo-epitrite is not thoroughly mastered until the close of the
                                period. Here, again, the basis of induction is too narrow, the
                                    <foreign lang="greek">a)/logos ai)/sqhsis</foreign> is too
                                potent an element.</p>
                            <p>The second period, according to Schmidt, extends from Pindar's
                                fortieth to his sixty-fifth year &mdash; a stirring time. To
                                    <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Second period.</note>the
                                opening of it belong the battle of Salamis &mdash; a contest of
                                Panhellenic significance far greater than Marathon &mdash; and
                                the battle of Plataia, which touched Pindar nearly. Thebes was
                                severely chastised for her adherence to the Persians, and the
                                dominant aristocratic party sorely humiliated. It is supposed
                                &mdash; it is a mere supposition &mdash; that Pindar, though
                                of the nobility, was not with the nobility; that his vision had
                                widened. The aristocracy was no longer the only form of government
                                worthy of the name, and so he was fitted by nature and insight to
                                act as a mediator between extremes. And yet it would be hard to
                                prove from Pindar's poems that he ever had a reasonable sympathy
                                with democracy anywhere. There was no call for such sympathy. The
                                victors in the games were all of his own order.</p>
                            <p>In this second period Pindar's reputation extended more and more; the
                                princes of the earth sought the honor of being glorified by him.
                                When he was fifty he yielded to Hieron's solicitations and paid a
                                visit to Syracuse. When he was in his fifty-sixth year he is
                                supposed to have been at the court of Arkesilas IV. of Kyrene. Of
                                his travels, however, it is confessed <pb n="lxi"/> we know nothing.
                                We may infer from his extensive connections and his exact knowledge
                                of localities and of family history that he had journeyed far and
                                wide; but we are often unable to tell whether it is the singer or
                                the song that is voyaging, and the minute local knowledge may be due
                                in part to the persons from whom Pindar held his commission. In any
                                case, the transmission of the names and fortunes of mythic
                                characters presents problems enough in every department of Greek
                                poetry. A personal acquaintance with Athens is not unlikely, though
                                by no means certain. The high praise that he bestowed upon the city
                                is referred by Schmidt to the time between the second Persian war
                                and his visit to Syracuse. The relations between the Dorians and the
                                Athenians became more tense afterwards, and Schmidt himself
                                acknowledges that as Pindar grew older he went back to the faith of
                                his fathers, the aristocratic creed in which he was nursed.</p>
                            <p>Pindar's rise in national estimation gave him a higher selfesteem. He
                                likes to show that his song makes him the peer of kings. But it must
                                not be forgotten that his boldest utterances are courtliness itself,
                                and that the Greek of that period would not have understood the
                                modern attitude of the subject to the throne. It is absurd to see
                                any freedom in his calling Hieron &ldquo;friend.&rdquo; His
                                own achievements and the achievements of the Persian war are
                                supposed to have led him to higher views of human power. Success in
                                the games is not due to fortune or to fate, but rather to the
                                victor's own prowess, the victor's own zeal, the victor's family
                                record, especially in its religious aspects, to the favor of a
                                special deity, and chiefly to the favor of Apollo. Here, again, it
                                may be said that the material for the first period is too scant for
                                the establishment of such a contrast in the second.</p>
                            <p>The advance in the art of composition in the second period is a point
                                that cannot be discussed without illustrations from the several
                                odes. To reach Schmidt's conclusions it would be necessary to accept
                                Schmidt's analyses, which often err by supersubtilty. The attempt
                                has been made in this edition to follow the growth of the odes in
                                the poet's mind. A general <pb n="lxii"/> plan there was, doubtless,
                                in each poem; but it was not a rigid scheme, and shaped itself into
                                graceful variations as the poet wrought at his work. The myth grew
                                out of the theme, its heart or head, as the herb in Isabella's Pot
                                of Basil. We must have suggestion, play, sweep, or we have no
                                poetry. Now, according to Schmidt, it is only in this period that we
                                have any such organic unity; it is only in this period that he sees
                                the happy co-operation of imagination and plastic force. Yet even
                                here he notices a difference. After fifty the significance of each
                                poem may be summed up in a formula; before, the fundamental notion
                                is so incarnate that we cannot dissect it out. But no high poetry is
                                exhausted by its recurrent burdens, its catch-words, its key-verses,
                                just as no high poetry is in any sense translatable.</p>
                            <p>The advance in the art of the narrative is another point where we
                                have to encounter the danger of <foreign lang="la">a
                                priori</foreign> characterization, and the difficulty of a narrow
                                range of observation. Critics have noted that the construction of
                                Thackeray's earliest stories is as perfect as that of his latest.
                                The difference lies in the detail work. The Pindaric manner of
                                story-telling, with its sharp outlines of light, its tips of
                                coruscations, remains the same throughout.</p>
                            <p>But to follow in detail all the changes that Schmidt has noticed in
                                the second period is not possible within the limits of this essay.
                                The third period &mdash; the period of the senile <note

                                &mdash; is marked by a decided decline. &ldquo;The eagle

                                as subtile as ever, the humor is as fresh, the feeling is as warm,
                                but the fair enchantment of the harmony between the world of idea
                                and the world of fact is gone. The old poet falls into the sins of
                                his youth. His composition is unequal; and yet so much praise is
                                lavished on the five odes &mdash; and one of them of doubtful
                                authenticity &mdash; that Pindar falls, if he falls, upon a bed
                                of roses.</p>
                            <p>Without refusing, then, the meed of praise to the intense study that
                                has enabled Schmidt to draw in finest details the image of the
                                poet's life and the poet's art &mdash; without denying <pb
                                    n="lxiii"/> the value of the attempt to form such a picture of
                                Pindar's development, we may be pardoned for declining to accept as
                                final results reached by processes so shadowy with materials so

                                    place="marg">Metres</note>us begin with the easier odes. Which
                                are the easier odes? Not the shorter ones necessarily, for the
                                fourth Pythian, the longest of all, is one of the easiest, and the
                                fourteenth Olympian, one of the shortest, has given the commentators
                                much trouble. The fact is, a man who has read himself into Pindar is
                                a poor judge of the relative difficulty of the odes unless he has
                                made actual trial in the class-room, and the experience of most
                                lovers of Pindar has of necessity been limited, as Pindar has seldom
                                been read in our colleges. And yet it might be safe to recommend
                                some such course as this. For the beginning, within the range of
                                Olympians and Pythians, O. 12, 11 (10) &mdash; the short ode for
                                Agesidamos &mdash; then O. 3, 6, 7; P. 3, 4; for the
                                culmination, whatever else may lie between, O. 1, 2; P. 2. This
                                advice is based purely on the relative difficulty, but those who
                                know Pindar will see at once that the easier odes are
                                dactylo-epitrite, the harder odes are logaoedic or paionian. Of
                                course it is not to be expected that the student will be satisfied
                                with so long a course of dactylo-epitrites, but the lesson is this:
                                If any ode of Pindar is to be studied as a work of art, it is to be
                                approached as a work of art, and the first thing to be mastered, not
                                theoretically, but practically, is the form. A good recitation will
                                be found of far greater value than much discourse about the
                                atmosphere of the <term>epinikion.</term> The poem must be read
                                rhythmically over and over until it can be read <pb n="lxiv"/>
                                fluently aloud, and this must precede the intellectual study. Then,
                                of course, the vocabulary must be looked after, though the Pindaric
                                vocabulary is not very troublesome; thereupon the commentary, and
                                finally the introduction, by way of review. When the rhythm is
                                mastered, it will be found that the way is open for the appreciation
                                of the meaning of the poem in its parts and as a whole. The stress
                                falls on the summits of the thought. Words are not divorced that are
                                bound together by rhythm, no matter how widely they are separated to
                                the eye. Key-notes make themselves heard. The welding of masses
                                makes itself felt. The confused figures group themselves into
                                patterns, and out of the darkness, as out of a picture of Rembrandt,
                                the remotest forms come forth to the vision. Then it will be soon
                                enough to bring in the historical apparatus, soon enough, if it is
                                ever soon enough, to bring in the metaphysical analysis, the logical
                                skeleton, which is supposed to exhibit the organism of the ode,
                                though vertebrae and ribs and thigh-bones are often missing, to say
                                nothing of the head.</p>

                                metre, but neither are commentators about every detail of the

                                matters that are cognizable by the eye rather than by the ear

                            <p>Lyric poetry meant among the Greeks what the words mean. It was meant

                                the voice; sometimes both instruments were used. The rhythmical

                                melic rather than lyric, and Sappho and Alkaios are not the artistic
                                ancestors of Pindar. Their poetry, full of passion and fire as it
                                was, had not the sustained flight of the choral ode. It was from the
                                poems of Stesichoros that Pindar learned how to build the fourth

                                these groups must be of such dimensions as to be comprehensible.
                                Hence the definition <pb n="lxvi"/> of rhythm as <foreign

                                was marked by the recurrence of a beat. So we have a strong time and
                                a weak time, <foreign lang="greek">qe/sis</foreign> and <foreign

                                afterwards inverted. In these simple statements lies the whole
                                theory of rhythm. There must be an orderly succession of groups of
                                time, these groups must be accentuated by stress, they must have
                                simple proportions and a moderate extent, so that the ear can
                                recognize them, and finally they must be equal to one another. The
                                conditions of verse-rhythm are the same as those of musical rhythm.
                                As a rule, we have in every Greek verse a sequence of equal or
                                equivalent feet under the domination of a regularly recurring
                                stress.</p>
                            <p>The elements of verses are called feet, just as we call the <note

                            <p>In language, as we have seen, rhythm is marked by stress of voice.
                                The stressed part is called arsis, the unstressed thesis, the stress
                                itself the ictus.</p>
                            <p>Rhythm when represented in language is embodied in metre. A metre is
                                a system of syllables that stand in a determined <note
                                    anchored="yes" place="marg">Metre.</note> order. Of course only
                                those metres are of importance that embody the principal rhythms.
                                The unit of measure is the short syllable, <foreign lang="meter"
                                >u</foreign> (<foreign lang="greek">xro/nos</foreign>, <term

                                equals a quarter note.</p>
                            <p>The classes of rhythm are based on the relation of arsis to thesis.

                            <p>It is clear that here as elsewhere observation must come in. We must
                                find the great periods, which in Pindar are so clearly marked by the
                                sense that there is little dispute about them, and then within the
                                periods mark the <foreign lang="greek">kw=la</foreign> or members,
                                and observe the regular sequences. True, such <foreign lang="greek"
                                    >kw=la</foreign> are already laid down by the metrical
                                scholiasts, but scholars are divided as to the value of them, and
                                the schemes followed here rest on the observations of J. H. H.
                                Schmidt, who has rejected the antique kolometry, and has based his
                                results on wide induction. The details belong to the systematic
                                study of the subject and cannot be introduced here.</p>
                            <p>The <foreign lang="greek">kw=la</foreign> are designated in the

                                    <foreign lang="meter">#</foreign>. Within each period there is a

                                different names according to the order of the recurrence. <foreign

                                Logaoedic. There are only a few specimens of the Paeon and the
                                Bacchius.</p>
                            <p>1. The Dactylo-epitrite measures receive the name from the
                                combination of the dactyl, <foreign lang="meter">- u u</foreign>,
                                with the so-called <note anchored="yes" place="marg"

                                epitrite meaning 1 1/3 = 4/3, and supposed to be a rhythm in which
                                arsis is to thesis as 4 to 3. <foreign lang="meter">- u -
                                -</foreign> would be divided as arsis, thesis, arsis, thesis. The
                                name is retained for convenience' sake; the true measure is, as we
                                have seen, <foreign lang="meter">3 u | - -|</foreign>. <pb
                                    n="lxxiii"/></p>
                            <p>The model dactylo-epitrite rhythm is shown in O. 3.</p>
                            <p>About half the extant odes of Pindar are composed in these rhythms,
                                which are also called Dorian. They are elevated, well-balanced,
                                equable, and present a marked contrast to the lively, lilting,
                                excited logaoedic measures, and the still more stirring cretic.
                                There is a thorough correspondence between the sense and the rhythm.
                                The Dorian odes are much easier to follow, the development is, as a
                                rule, much more regular, the forms are not so puzzling, even the
                                tenses sympathize with the rhythm, and the leisurely unfolding of
                                the imperfect is more common in the dactylo-epitrite than in the
                                logaoedic.</p>
                            <p>2. The Logaoedic rhythm is a 3/8 rhythm, the basis of which is the
                                trochee, but not the trochee with the ordinary ictus, <foreign
                                    lang="meter">-/u</foreign>
                                <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Logaoedic.</note> This trochee has
                                a stronger secondary ictus on the short, admits irrationality,
                                    <foreign lang="meter">-</foreign>&gt;, and takes as a
                                substitute the so-called cyclical or light dactyl, <foreign
                                    lang="meter">-u u</foreign>, in which the proportions are, as we
                                have seen, not 2 + 1 + 1 <foreign lang="la">morae</foreign>, but 1
                                1/2 + 1/2 + 1 = 3, a dotted-eighth rhythm. The apparent jumble of
                                dactyls and trochees, as in prose, gave rise to the name logaoedic
                                (from <foreign lang="greek">lo/gos</foreign> and <foreign
                                    lang="greek">a)oidh/</foreign>). The logaoedics are much used in
                                the lyric portion of the drama, and are familiar to all in the odes
                                of Horace, nearly half of the Horatian varieties, and more than
                                ninety per cent. of the odes, being logaoedic. The logaoedic rhythms
                                are lighter, more airy, than the dactylo-epitrite. They have festal
                                glitter rather than steady light, a rapid flitting rather than a
                                compassed march. All fancy apart, no stronger contrasts can be felt
                                than between the movements of the two odes on the victory of
                                Agesidamos (O. 10 and 11). The shorter ode rocks gently through a
                                series of antitheses. It is grave and stately, despite its short
                                compass. Not a preliminary flourish, not an anacrusis, throughout.
                                Contrast the dash and the whirl and the surprise of the longer ode.
                                O. 3 and O. 1 will also serve to bring out the contrast, which does
                                not rest on the imagination of the commentators, but on the
                                universal feeling of our race.</p>
                            <p>3. Those who have read the Acharnians of Aristophanes are familiar
                                with the passionate cretics that abound in that <pb n="lxxiv"/>
                                young and lusty play. The Cretic or Paionian rhythm shows itself in
                                two of our odes, O. 2 and P. 5, both of them <note anchored="yes"
                                    place="marg">Paionian.</note>counted among the more difficult
                                Pindaric poems by reason of their extreme elasticity. But the rhythm
                                of these odes reveals the secret of their soul, and instead of being
                                the most difficult, they are among the most easily understood. The
                                passionate movement betrays them. The keynote is struck at the very
                                beginning. In O. 2, <foreign lang="greek">qeo/s, h(/rws,
                                a)nh/r</foreign> recur with a persistency that cannot escape the
                                most careless observer, and in P. 5 we have really nothing but a
                                series of variations on <foreign lang="greek">plou=tos, a)reta/,
                                    po/tmos</foreign>, another trinity. Passion comes out with its
                                story; passion will not let its story rest.</p>
                            <p>In what relation do these rhythms stand to the

                            <p>The Dorian mood was manly and imposing, like the Dorians themselves;

                            <p>Doubtless, to a certain extent, the dialect was dictated by the
                                origin of the department. Lyric poetry emerging from the Epos could
                                not throw off the authority of Epic forms, but the so-called Epic
                                dialect is itself composite, and the Doric strains, with which the
                                Epic language was tempered by Stesichoros, became characteristic of
                                the higher lyric. And yet such is the freedom with which the Ionian
                                Simonides and the Theban Pindar handle the language, that we must
                                leave a wide margin for individual susceptibility. Those who
                                translate Homer back into the original Aiolic may yet reconstruct a
                                Pindar in uniform dialect. But till this is done it may be
                                provisionally assumed that Pindar used an artistic dialect that had
                                no definite relation to the spoken language, and it may be added
                                that if such a uniform dialect should be established, <pb n="lxxvii"
                                /> it would be a contradiction of the subtile variety that Pindar is
                                always producing out of his material, and always producing with as
                                full consciousness as true poets ever have. Pindar rejoices in his
                                play with language; he rings changes on words, he toys with
                                synonyms, he loves the discord of the oxymoron, and those who think
                                that such artistic devices are too mechanical forget that before
                                plastic art had developed its <foreign lang="fr">finesse</foreign>,
                                song had served an apprenticeship of ages. While awaiting, then, new
                                light, it may be permissible to call Pindar's language an artistic
                                dialect, and to give a rapid summary of the chief peculiarities that
                                mark it.</p>
                            <p>The basis is the language of the Epic, itself composite, and with
                                this are blended in varying proportions Aiolic and Doric <note
                                    anchored="yes" place="marg">Mixed.</note>forms. None of these
                                elements appears in its extremes. The flow of the Epic is retained,
                                but certain forms familiar in Homer are discarded. There are no
                                echoing verbs in -<foreign lang="greek">aw</foreign>, there is no
                                    -<foreign lang="greek">fi</foreign>, no infinitive in -<foreign
                                    lang="greek">emenai</foreign>. The Doric majesty and sonorous
                                fulness of utterance enter into the composition, but the older and
                                stiffer inflections are set aside. The first person plural cnds in
                                    -<foreign lang="greek">men</foreign> and not in -<foreign
                                    lang="greek">mes</foreign>, Pindar says <foreign lang="greek"
                                    >tou=</foreign> not <foreign lang="greek">tw=, tou/s</foreign>
                                not <foreign lang="greek">tw/s</foreign>. The Aiolic gives fire and
                                passion and a certain familiar sweetness as well, but the Boeotian
                                variety was not refined, and, in spite of local criticism, Pindar
                                preferred the Asiatic form of the dialect. Thus trebly and more than
                                trebly composite, Pindar's language shifts with the character of his
                                rhythms. The three moods &mdash; Dorian, Aiolian, Lydian
                                &mdash; call for different coloring, and the mobile Aiolian
                                measures show the greatest number of recondite forms, so that
                                dialect, rhythm, plan, imagery, are all in accord. Ahrens has seen
                                in the dialect of Pindar the influence of Delphic speech. So, for
                                instance, the use of <foreign lang="greek">e)n</foreign> with the
                                accusative, the elision of -<foreign lang="greek">i</foreign> in
                                    <foreign lang="greek">peri/</foreign>. But the evidence seems
                                too slight, and while the study of Pindar by the light of Hesiod is
                                instructive, the theory that they both used a Delphic dialect
                                remains an ingenious suggestion and nothing more.</p>

                                an after-thought. As it is, most of the Pindaric instances have

                            <p>The genitive absolute will be taken up under the participle, but it
                                may be said here that Pindar seems to go somewhat beyond the Homeric
                                limits. <pb n="xciii"/></p>
                            <p>The dative case in Pindar shows the three elements &mdash; the
                                dative proper, or personal dative (Latin dative), the local dative,
                                    <note anchored="yes" place="marg">Dative.</note>and the
                                instrumental, or, better, comitative. The personal dative is a
                                locative <emph>plus</emph> sensibility; the locative is limited in
                                its range; the comitative has a personal as well as a local
                                character, and this is brought out especially when it is reinforced
                                by <foreign lang="greek">su/n</foreign>.</p>
                            <p>The personal dative is used in Pindar with poetic freedom, but the
                                differences from Homeric use and from prose use are <note
                                    anchored="yes" place="marg">Personal Dative.</note>not startling
                                for the most part. The differences are differences of degree, not of
                                kind, and it is unnecessary to go through the categories of the
                                dative of possession (so-called), of profit and loss, freely
                                combined with verbal nouns as well as with verbs, the ethic dative.
                                It may, however, be worth while to say that there is no double
                                dative in the sense of whole and part as in the acc. (<foreign
                                    lang="greek">sxh=ma kaq' o(/lon kai\ me/ros</foreign>). In
                                Pindar, as in Homer, the dative of the whole depends on the complex
                                with the second dative. So <bibl n="Pind. O. 2">O. 2.16:</bibl>

                                The so-called dative of the agent, however, is really a dative of
                                personal interest. The agency is only an inference. The prose
                                construction is generally with the perf. or equivalent aor. (cf.

                            <p>With some verbs which familiarly take the dative, Pindar occasionally
                                uses a preposition to make the image more vivid. So especially

                            <p>The adjectives that vary between genitive and dative vary according

                            <p>The comitative, or, as it is more usually called, the instrumental

                                but he often uses the more personal <foreign lang="greek"

                                the verbal noun has much of the verbal motion in Pindar, we are
                                prepared for such extensions as I. 2, 13: <foreign lang="greek"
                                    >*)isqmi/an i(/ppoisi ni/kan</foreign>. Instrument, manner,
                                cause, run into one another. They are all common in Pindar, and need
                                not be cited. The causal <pb n="xcv"/> dative construction, however,
                                it may be noted, is not so common in Homer. Whether the dative as
                                the measure of difference is instrumental or local is open to
                                discussion. The local conception has simplicity in its favor. We can
                                say <foreign lang="greek">diafe/rein e)n</foreign>, we can say
                                    <foreign lang="greek">e)n basa/nw|</foreign>. So <foreign

                                    >O. 8.20</bibl>) is &ldquo;wherein&rdquo; rather than
                                &ldquo;whereby,&rdquo; though local and instrumental are not
                                far apart. The descriptive dative, or dat. of manner, <foreign

                                    >P. 1.55</bibl>), is common, and there are a few dative adverbs
                                varying with prepositional combination. <foreign lang="greek"
                                >tu/xa|</foreign> is less common than <foreign lang="greek">su\n
                                    tu/xa| di/ka|</foreign> than <foreign lang="greek">su\n di/ka|,

                            <p>From the local dative must be separated the locative proper, such as

                                Pindar does not exercise them freely. When the simple dative is

                                    lang="greek">u(po/</foreign> with the genitive is still
                                &ldquo;under,&rdquo; still what we should call <foreign
                                    lang="greek">u(pe/k</foreign>, although the local meaning comes
                                out more distinctly with the dative. See note on <bibl
                                    n="Pind. O. 6">O. 6.35</bibl>. These are only specimens, but
                                they are sufficient to show that in Pindar's poetry the prepositions
                                stand out with local vividness.</p>
                            <p>The large use of the adjective instead of the genitive has already
                                been remarked on, and needs no further emphasis, <note

                            <p>In the use of the demonstratives Pindar differs from the tragic poets
                                in his comparatively scant employment of <foreign lang="greek"
                                >o(/de</foreign>, which is pre-eminently dramatic. <pb n="ci"/></p>
                            <p>Lyric poetry makes little use of the article proper. This is best
                                shown by a comparison of chorus and dialogue in the <note
                                    anchored="yes" place="marg">Article.</note>drama. In Pindar the
                                old demonstrative sense is still conspicuous, the article can still
                                represent and does represent freely an independent demonstrative
                                pronoun; it can be used as a relative. In combination with the
                                substantive it has the familiar anaphoric use, the emphatic
                                reference to that which is known, the use in vision, like <foreign
                                    lang="greek">o(/de</foreign>. In the dactylo-epitrite poems, in
                                which the article is generally less freely employed, the article
                                seems to serve to bind the qualifier to the far-distant substantive,
                                as in the noted passage, <bibl n="Pind. O. 12">O. 12.5:</bibl>

                                surprising. It is only in the dactylo-epitrites that the movement is
                                deliberate enough to allow the separation. In the tumult of the
                                logaoedic the nexus would be lost. The ordinary use of the article
                                is also found in Pindar, but it would take very little stress to
                                revive the demonstrative meaning. The extensions of the article that
                                are most noteworthy, in comparison with Homer, are the combination
                                with the adjective <foreign lang="greek">ta\ terpna/</foreign>
                                    (<bibl n="Pind. O. 9">O. 9.30</bibl>), that with the

                                active, and it is a mistake to apply the causative formula as the
                                key wherever the conception seems remote to us. Difficult is

                                may be the true one there, though <foreign lang="greek"

                                be tempted to see in Pindar's use of <foreign lang="greek"

                            <p>As to the present indicative in Pindar, chiefly worthy of note is the

                                vindicated the proethnic rights of the historical present on the
                                just ground of the timelessness of the present. It is therefore not
                                a little remarkable that Pindar uses it as little as Homer uses it.
                                To them the historical present must have been either too vulgar or

                                incisive action (see note on <bibl n="Pind. P. 2">P.

                            <p>The future has many marks of a modal origin. It is not simply
                                predictive. Like the English periphrastic
                                &ldquo;shall&rdquo; and <note anchored="yes" place="marg"
                                    >Future.</note>&ldquo;will,&rdquo; it was originally
                                something more than the foretelling of what was to come. Traces of
                                this modal future are found here and there in P. <foreign

                                    n="civ"/> becomes a verb of wishing or willing, there is no
                                difficulty about the use of the aorist as a future (see note on
                                    <bibl n="Pind. P. 1">P. 1.44</bibl>), but the fut. often lies
                                too near, as <bibl n="Pind. P. 4">P. 4.243</bibl>, where

                                4 to 1. In Pindar they nearly balance. In all Homer there is but one

                                reference to v. 417. Pindar has no <foreign lang="greek"
                                >a)/n</foreign> with the inf., but he uses <foreign lang="greek"
                                >ken</foreign> three times with the inf., with pres. (<bibl

                                to <foreign lang="greek">a)/n</foreign> with the negative, but he
                                does not use it in the formulated conditional sentence, although it
                                has effected a lodgment in the generic relative and in the temporal
                                sentence, from which in Attic it was destined to shut out the old
                                constructions with the pure subjunctive.</p>
                            <p>A short space must suffice for the behavior of the moods in compound
                                sentences. The structure of the sentence is very much simplified by
                                the large use of the participle and the freedom of the infinitive.
                                Pindar has much less variety than Homer, and in syntax, as in other
                                matters, shows a certain daintiness of selection.</p>

                                all the others put together. It is largely a mere formal condition.
                                It is based on what the poet knows or sees. Sometimes it is generic
                                (see O. 11 [10], 4), but it almost always has in view a particular
                                illustration of the principle involved.</p>
                            <p>The generic condition proper is put in the old form of this

                                chiefly, perhaps exclusively the aorist subj., for in I. 4 (5), 12:
                                    <foreign lang="greek">ei) a)kou/sh|</foreign>, almost forces
                                itself on the reader. Pindar knows nothing of <foreign lang="greek"

                            <p>Pindar's few ideal conditions (<foreign lang="greek">ei)</foreign>
                                with opt.) occur in dreamy, wistful passages, which seem to show
                                that the optative is, after all, not ill-named. Sometimes we can
                                feel the growth out of the wish (<bibl n="Pind. O. 1">O.

                                formal wish is followed by an apodosis (<bibl n="Pind. P. 1">P.
                                    1.46</bibl>). Still fewer are the unreal conditions, conditions
                                against fact, and in these we hear the hopeless wish (<bibl
                                    n="Pind. P. 3">P. 3.63</bibl>. 73). We are evidently in a

                                not yet allowed itself to violate the sense of form by using a
                                preposition with what had been so long felt as a dative. And this
                                dative force &mdash; for the infinitive seems to be the dative
                                of a verbal noun &mdash; accounts for all that is peculiar in
                                the use of the Pindaric infinitive. Whether we call it epexegetic,
                                whether we call it final, we are still in the sphere of the dative.

                                    place="marg">Participles.</note> that the lyric poet should make
                                large use of the participle, which enables him to concentrate his
                                narrative on the main points, while preserving the color of the
                                thought or the description. We are prone to analyze the participle,
                                to call it temporal, conditional, adversative, whereas the
                                participial form avoids and often defies the analysis. When the
                                later rhetorician wanted logical clearness, he would none of the
                                participle, and Dionysios of Halikarnassos makes a distinct point

                                the genitive absolute. In narrative the participle gives color,
                                gives atmosphere. Turn it into a finite verb and you have a
                                catalogue, at best an outline, and not a picture. Notice the effect
                                of <bibl n="Pind. O. 1">O. 1.49</bibl>-51, where each point of

                                has been too leisurely in his narrative, his haste is marked by the
                                use of finite verbs. So at the close of the story of the Argonautic
                                expedition, after recounting the adventure with the fire-breathing
                                oxen, in which descriptive participles play a conspicuous part
                                    (<bibl n="Pind. P. 4">P. 4.224</bibl>-237), Pindar, as if
                                feeling that his time was short, has not a participle to throw away
                                on the adventure of <pb n="cx"/> the dragon, and when he openly
                                acknowledges (v. 247) that he must be brief, he touches off each
                                stage in the subsequent action with a single finite aorist verb, and
                                does not even allow a parenthetic imperfect.</p>
                            <p>Instead, then, of the formal sentences of time, cause, adversative
                                relation, condition, purpose, we often find the participle, although

                            <p>Many other points must be omitted for want of space, and the reader
                                is referred to the commentary for further particulars. The large use
                                of parataxis makes the Pindaric handling of the particles of
                                especial interest to the grammarian, and we find exactness as in the
                                use of <foreign lang="greek">te . . . te . . ., te kai/</foreign>,
                                paired with bold variation as <foreign lang="greek">me\n . . .
                                te</foreign>. It must suffice here, if the impression has been
                                produced that in syntax, as in everything else, Pindar is sharp,
                                cogent, effective. There is no &ldquo;subjectivity&rdquo;
                                about his pictures, and the syntax plays its part, too often
                                overlooked, in producing the bold contour. <pb n="cxiv"/> A complete
                                Pindaric syntax would be at the same time a theory of Pindaric

                            <p>The order of words in Pindar is of prime importance to those who
                                would study &ldquo;composition&rdquo; in the antique sense,

                                effect of the sequence of sounds must be left to special

                                the average reader, however, the position of words is chiefly of
                                interest, so far as it gives emphasis to the leading elements, and
                                in this respect the study of the rhythms aids very much in removing
                                the difficulties that the beginner may find. In the equable measures
                                of the dactylo-epitrites the separation of the words gives very
                                little trouble. Our minds are attuned to the leisurely motion, and
                                we can afford to wait. The stress - points of the verse signal to
                                one another. No matter what the distance between beginning and end
                                of a verse, they are never really far apart, and then again the
                                meaning is often to be gathered from the edge of the ode in a manner
                                of acrostic. The attention is often kept alive by suspense, the
                                object being held back as if it were the answer to a riddle, and
                                this very suspense serves to preserve the organic unity as well as
                                to bind epode more closely to antistrophe. Sometimes when the
                                thought seems to have reached its legitimate end, a message follows,
                                a momentous codicil to the poetic testament, a condition, a
                                restriction. Sometimes again a word is <pb n="cxv"/> held by the
                                power of the rhythm until it penetrates the whole structure.
                                Sometimes the poet strikes sharply two or three notes that convey to
                                the student the movement of the whole, and O. 2 and P. 5 give up
                                their secret to the skilled in song. All this is capable of
                                demonstration, but it is a weariness to demonstrate what every one
                                who attacks Pindar resolutely will soon find out for himself.<note

                                overlooked by the beginner; it is the beautiful Greek method of
                                giving a double stress to opposing pairs, a stress that we are prone
                                to bring about by the mechanical expedient of hammering emphasis and

                                knitting of words. By hypallage an attribute that belongs in logical
                                strictness to one word of a complex is applied to another. Sometimes
                                it makes so little difference that no notice has been taken of it in
                                this edition. If, for instance, the kine are dun, what trouble is

                                into a <foreign lang="xgreek">tyrannis</foreign> by Gelon, prince of
                                Gela, who reconciled the factions of the city, Ol. 73, 4 (485 B.C.).
                                After Gelon became lord of Syracuse, he made it his residence,
                                enlarged it, built up Achradina, added Tyche, and what was
                                afterwards called Neapolis. All this was not accomplished without
                                high-handed measures, such as the transplanting of the populations
                                of other cities. Gela lost half its inhabitants. Kamarina was razed
                                to the ground, and the Kamarinaians transferred in a body to
                                Syracuse (see O. 4). Under Gelon's rule Syracuse became the chief
                                city of Sicily, the tyrant of Syracuse one of the most important
                                personages on Grecian soil. Applied to by the Greeks for aid, when
                                the invasion of Xerxes was impending, Gelon offered two hundred
                                triremes, twenty thousand men-at-arms, two thousand cavalry, two
                                thousand archers, two thousand slingers, two thousand light troops,
                                and provisions for the whole Greek army until the close of the war,

                                offer was declined, Gelon was called on to help his father-in-law,
                                Theron of Akragas, against the Carthaginians, who had espoused the
                                cause of Terillos of Himera (see O. 12), and Anaxilas of Rhegion,

                                &mdash; ended in the signal defeat of the Carthaginians, who
                                lost one hundred and fifty thousand men dead on the field. The
                                Carthaginians sued for peace, which was granted on singularly easy
                                terms; for the Carthaginians were backed by the Persian empire with
                                its vast resources. The battle of Salamis had not yet shown the
                                weakness of the Persian power; and, in fact, the immediate effect of
                                that battle has been exaggerated. Persia lost little of her prestige
                                until the close of the fifth century, and Persian gold was a potent
                                element in Greek history far into the fourth.</p>
                            <p>The consequence of the victory at Himera was a vast accession of
                                power and influence for Gelon. Anaxilas of Rhegion, and a number of
                                Sicilian cities, recognized his supremacy. But in the midst of his
                                plans and projects Gelon died of dropsy, Ol. 75, 3 (478 B.C.). To
                                his brother, Polyzelos, he left the command of the army, the
                                guardianship of his minor son, and the hand of his widow, daughter
                                of Theron. Hieron, the elder of the surviving brothers, who had been
                                prince of Gela, succeeded to the government. Owing to the
                                machinations of Hieron, Polyzelos was forced to take refuge with
                                Theron of Akragas, who was at once his father-in-law and his
                                son-in-law; and a war between Hieron and Theron was imminent, had
                                not a reconciliation been effected by Simonides, the poet. Polyzelos
                                was allowed to return to Syracuse, but Hieron was thenceforward sole
                                ruler. In 477 the Epizephyrian Lokrians invoked the help of Hieron
                                against Anaxilas of Rhegion; the prince sent his brother-inlaw,
                                Chromios (see N. 1 and 9), to Anaxilas, and the lord of Rhegion held
                                his hand. In 474 the inhabitants of Kyme (Cumae) were hard pressed
                                by the Etruscans. Hieron immediately granted the desired aid, and
                                defeated the Etruscans in a naval engagement off Cumae. A helmet

                                &mdash; Hieron defeated Thrasydaios, son of Theron, and Akragas
                                and Himera both acknowledged his sway; but he granted them their
                                independence and a democratic constitution. <pb n="127"/></p>
                            <p>To his success in war Hieron wished to add the heroic honors paid to
                                the founder of a new city. This new city, Aitna, was founded, Ol.
                                76, 1 (476 B.C.), in the territory of Katana, the old inhabitants
                                having been removed to Leontini. Ten thousand citizens were
                                imported, half from Syracuse and Gela, the other half Peloponnesian
                                immigrants. The constitution was Doric; and Hieron's son,
                                Deinomenes, and his brother-in-law, Chromios, were put in charge.
                                Hieron often called himself <foreign lang="greek"
                                >*ai)tnai=os</foreign> (P. 1); Chromios followed his example (N. 1),
                                and the founding of the city was celebrated by the
                                &ldquo;Aitnaian women&rdquo; of Aischylos, and by Pindar's
                                first Pythian.</p>
                            <p>The court of Hieron was a centre of literature and art. Epicharmos
                                was a frequent guest. Aischylos, Simonides, Bakchylides, Pindar were
                                among the visitors. No Doric prince ever reached such a height of
                                glory. He was brilliantly successful at the great games: Ol. 73 and
                                77, with the single horse; Ol. 78, with the chariot; Pyth. 26 and
                                27, with the single horse; Pyth. 29, with the chariot, and again
                                with mules. Successes elsewhere are not unlikely. He devised and
                                performed liberal things. A special treasury was erected at Olympia
                                for the Carthaginian booty, and the noble gift which he vowed to the
                                Olympian Zeus was set up after his death by his son Deinomenes
                                &mdash; a bronze four-horse chariot and driver, the work of
                                Onatas, on either side a horse with a boy rider by Kalamis.</p>
                            <p>As a Doric prince, Hieron has found as little favor with posterity as
                                he did with his Athenian contemporary Themistokles. A tyrant, he
                                helped the moralists to make the uneasiness of crowned heads still
                                more uneasy. He became the type of splendid success and of splendid
                                misery; for he was tortured by bodily suffering, he was surrounded
                                by sycophants and informers, and lived in an atmosphere of treachery
                                and meanness. Those who see in Pindar's Hieronic odes sermons
                                levelled at the unfortunate prince will be inclined to despise the
                                greatest ruler of his day. A more humane judgment will recognize
                                high qualities impaired by the faults that were engendered and
                                exaggerated by the <term lang="xgreek">tyrannis.</term></p>

                                    a)|sma/twn a(pa/ntwn</foreign>. It may have been put first,
                                because it was the most beautiful; but it owes, in turn, no little
                                of its celebrity to its position, for which it was commended by its
                                myth as well as by its theme. The chariot-race of Pelops for
                                Hippodameia was the true beginning of Olympian contests, and the
                                Pelopion was the heart of Pisa. The Aiolian rhythms are bright and
                                festal, and glitter as the language glitters. Pindar is consciously
                                treading a lofty measure. &ldquo;No better element than
                                water,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;no brighter blaze than fire by
                                night, no form of wealth that outdazzles gold, no light of heaven so
                                luminous, so warming, as the sun, which dims the ether into
                                voidness, no contest more noble than the Olympian, the source of
                                highest songs to highest bards, chanting Zeus supreme in the palace
                                of Sicily's chief lord, who plucks the loftiest fruits of emprise,
                                who is decked with the sheen of the fairest flower of poesy. For him
                                the noblest chords must be struck, the sweetest musings of the poet
                                recalled, and the scene brought back when the steed Victor bore his
                                lord to triumph (vv. 1-22). Forth shines his glory in the land which
                                Lydian Pelops made his own, for Pelops, the favorite of the gods,
                                has found his resting-place (v. 93) where Hieron, favorite of the
                                gods, has won his victory. The fame of Hieron shines forth (v. 23)
                                &mdash; the fame of the Olympiads looks forth (v. 94)
                                &mdash; and the story of Pelops is encircled by a belt of
                                glory.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>In his version of the Pelops legend (vv. 25-96), Pindar contradicts
                                the popular account: hence the elaborate <foreign lang="la"
                                >caveat</foreign> at the outset. To make the myth resplendent as his
                                theme, he must remove the foulness of envious tongues. No cannibal
                                feast was offered to the gods by Tantalos, none shared by them (v.
                                52). Tantalos's sin &mdash; the giving of the sacred nectar and
                                ambrosia to his fellows &mdash; brought ceaseless woe on
                                himself; but his son, though sent to earth again, was remembered by
                                Poseidon, to whom he had been what Ganymede was afterwards to Zeus.
                                The darkness of the fate of Tantalos only heightens the brilliancy
                                of the fortunes of Lydian Pelops.</p>
                            <p>The story told, the tone is sensibly lowered. An Olympian victory is
                                still sunshine for life, and Pindar avers that no prince <pb n="129"
                                /> more deserving of what is noble &mdash; none of more powerful
                                sway &mdash; shall be set forth by his hymns; but there is the
                                old moral that the present good is the highest, and the old
                                restlessness of hope for a yet sweeter song, and a yet more glorious
                                victory. And then, at the last, the poem rises to the height at
                                which it began. The Muse has her most powerful shaft in keeping for
                                the poet's bow. The king, as king, whatever else others may attain,
                                is at the summit of human fortune. Look no further. Prayer can only
                                seek the keeping of this lofty height for king and bard alike (vv.
                                97-116).</p>
                            <p>The poem is an epitome of Pindar's manner &mdash; approach by
                                overlapping parallels, the dexterous use of foils, implicit imagery.

                            <p>Akragas (Agrigentum) was a daughter of Gela. Gela was founded, Ol.
                                22, 4 (689 B.C.), by a Rhodian colony; Akragas more than a hundred
                                years afterwards, Ol. 49, 4 (581 B.C.). In Ol. 52, 3 (570 B.C.) the
                                notorious Phalaris made himself tyrant of the city, and, after a
                                rule of sixteen years, was dethroned by Telemachos, the grandfather
                                of Emmenes or Emmenides, who gave his name to the line, and became
                                the father of Ainesidamos. Under the sons of Ainesidamos, Theron and
                                Xenokrates, the name of the Emmenidai was brought to the height of
                                its glory, and an alliance formed with the ruling house of Syracuse.
                                Damareta, the daughter of Theron, married first Gelon, and, upon his
                                death, Polyzelos, his brother. Theron married a daughter of
                                Polyzelos, and, finally, Hieron married a daughter of Xenokrates.</p>
                            <p>The Emmenidai belonged to the ancient race of the Aigeidai, to which
                                Pindar traced his origin, and claimed descent from Kadmos, through
                                Polyneikes, who was the father of Thersandros by Argeia, daughter of
                                Adrastos. Evidently a roving, and doubtless a quarrelsome, race, the
                                descendants of Thersandros went successively to Sparta, to Thera, to
                                Rhodes, and finally to Akragas. Such was the ancestry of Theron, who
                                made himself master of Akragas by a trick, which he is said to have
                                redeemed by a just, mild, and beneficent reign. Under his rule
                                Akragas reached its highest eminence, and Theron's sway extended to
                                the neighborhood of Himera and the Tyrrhenian sea. When he drove out
                                Terillos, tyrant of Himera, and seized his throne, Terillos applied
                                to his son-in-law, Anaxilas of Rhegion, for help, who, in his turn,
                                invoked the aid of the Carthaginians. Thereupon Theron summoned to
                                his assistance his son-in-law, Gelon, of Syracuse, and in the famous
                                battle of Himera the Sicilian princes gained a brilliant victory.
                                (See <ref target="o1" targOrder="U">Introd. to Ol. 1.</ref>) The
                                enormous booty was spent on the adornment of Syracuse and Akragas.
                                Akragas became one of the most beautiful cities <pb n="141"/> of the
                                world, and the ruins of Girgenti are still among the most imposing
                                remains of antiquity. A few years after the battle of Himera, Gelon
                                died, Ol. 75, 3 (478 B.C.), and was succeeded by his brother Hieron
                                in the rule of Syracuse. To the other brother, Polyzelos, were
                                assigned the command of the army and the hand of Damareta, daughter
                                of Theron, widow of Gelon, with the guardianship of Gelon's son; but
                                the two brothers had not been on the best terms before, and Hieron
                                took measures to get rid of Polyzelos, who was a popular prince.
                                Polyzelos took refuge with Theron, who had married his daughter, and
                                who in consequence of this double tie refused to give him up to
                                Hieron. The Himeraians, oppressed by Theron's son Thrasydaios, made
                                propositions to Hieron; two cousins of Theron, Kapys and
                                Hippokrates, joined his enemies, and the armies of Hieron and Theron
                                faced each other on the banks of the Gela. Thanks, however, to the
                                good offices of the poet Simonides, peace was made; Polyzelos was
                                suffered to return, and Hieron married the daughter of Xenokrates,
                                brother of Theron. The rebellious spirits in Himera were quelled,
                                and our just, mild, and beneficent prince, who was elevated to the
                                rank of a hero after his death, so thinned the ranks of the citizens
                                by executions that it was necessary to fill them up by foreigners.
                                Kapys and Hippokrates having been put to flight, Theron sat firmly
                                on his throne again, and, after putting to death all his enemies,
                                had the great satisfaction of gaining an Olympian victory, Ol. 76
                                (476 B.C.), which Pindar celebrates in this ode and the following.</p>
                            <p>Theron died Ol. 76, 4; Xenokrates, his brother, who won two of the
                                victories celebrated by Pindar (P. 6 and I. 2), died either before
                                him or soon after. Thrasydaios, his son and successor, whose cruelty
                                had roused the Himeraians to revolt, chastised the Agrigentines with
                                scorpions, and attacked Hieron with 20,000 mercenaries. After his
                                defeat, Akragas and Himera rose against him, and he fled to Megara,
                                where he died, and the revolted cities became democracies.
                                Thrasybulus, the son of Xenokrates, continued to live in Akragas,
                                but the memory of Thrasydaios was a stench in the nostrils of the
                                Himeraians; hence their gratitude to <foreign lang="greek">*zeu\s
                                    *)eleuqe/rios</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">*sw/teira
                                    *tu/xa</foreign> for having delivered them from such a monster
                                (O. 12).</p>
                            <p>In the opening of the second Olympian, Pindar himself points out the
                                threefold cord that runs through the ode, and recent <pb n="142"/>
                                commentators have found triads everywhere. It is best to limit
                                ourselves to the poet's own lines. When Pindar asks, &ldquo;What
                                god, what hero, what man shall we celebrate?&rdquo; he means to
                                celebrate all three, and god, hero, and man recur throughout: the
                                god helping, the hero toiling, the man achieving. God is the
                                disposer, the hero the leader, and the man the follower. The man,
                                the Olympian victor, must walk in the footsteps of the greater
                                victor, must endure hardness as the hero endured hardness, in order
                                that he may have a reward, as the hero had his reward, by the favor
                                of God. This is a poem for one who stands on the solemn verge beyond
                                which lies immortal, heroic life. But we must not read a funeral
                                sermon into it, and we must notice how the poet counteracts the
                                grave tone of the poem by the final herald cry, in which he
                                magnifies his own office and champions the old king.</p>
                            <p>Hymns, lords of the lyre, what god, what hero, what man shall we
                                sound forth? Pisa belongs to Zeus (<foreign lang="greek"
                                >qeo/s</foreign>), Olympia was stablished by Herakles (<foreign

                                His sires (<foreign lang="greek">h(/rwes</foreign>) founded Akragas;
                                Zeus (<foreign lang="greek">qeo/s</foreign>) send the future
                                glorious as the past has been (vv. 1-17). Done cannot be made
                                undone. The past was toilsome and bitter, but forgetfulness comes
                                with bliss, and suffering expires in joyance. So in the line of
                                Theron himself, the daughters of Kadmos (<foreign lang="greek"
                                    >h(rw=|nai, h)oi=ai</foreign>), Semele, Ino, suffering once, as
                                the founders of Akragas toiled once, are now glorified. Yet this
                                light was quenched in deeper gloom. After Semele, after Ino, comes
                                the rayless darkness of Oidipus, so dark that even his name is
                                shrouded. Polyneikes fell, but Thersandros was left, and after him
                                came Theron (<foreign lang="greek">a)nh/r</foreign>), and Theron's
                                noble house, with its noble victories (vv. 17-57). But this is not
                                all. Earthly bliss is not everything. There is another world, and
                                the poet sets its judgment-seat, unfolds the happiness of the
                                blessed, and introduces into the harmony of the blissful abode a
                                marvellous discord of the damned. In that land we hear of Kronos and
                                of Rhea (<foreign lang="greek">qeoi/</foreign>), Peleus, and Kadmos,
                                and Achilles (<foreign lang="greek">h(/rwes</foreign>). Of men there
                                is expressive silence (vv. 58-91). Theron is old, and the poet,
                                instead of working out his triad mechanically, vindicates the
                                reserve of his art. He has arrows enough in his quiver; he has power
                                enough in his pinion. He can shoot, he can fly, whithersoever he
                                will; and now, that we have left that other world, and have come
                                back to this realm of Zeus, he bends his bow, he <pb n="143"/>
                                stoops his flight, to Akragas. Now he can praise Theron with all the
                                solemnity but without the gloom of an epitaph, and the last words
                                fall like a benediction on the gracious king (vv. 92110).</p>
                            <p>There is no myth proper. The canvas is covered by the
                                prefiguration-picture of the house of Kadmos and the vision of the
                                world beyond. Innocent suffering is recompensed by deep happiness,
                                heroic toil by eternal reward. Theron's achievements have the
                                earnest of an immortal future. Time cannot express his deeds of
                                kindness.</p>
                            <p>The rhythms are Paionian, manly, vigorous, triumphant, but Bakcheiac
                                strains seem to have been introduced with the same effect as the
                                belts of darkness which chequer the poem.</p>
                            <p>Of the five triads, the first opens the theme, the last concludes it;
                                the second triad deals with the mythic past; the third returns to
                                Theron, and connects the second with the fourth, which is taken up
                                with the world beyond.</p>

                                <p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">qano/ntwn</lemma>: The sins
                                    committed in the world below are punished here on earth. Earth
                                    and Hades are mutual hells. P.'s view of the yonder world, as
                                    set forth in this passage, may be supplemented by the fragments
                                    of the <foreign lang="greek">qrh=noi</foreign>. P. believes in
                                    the continued existence of the soul after death, in
                                    transmigration, in retribution, in eternal blessedness.
                                    Immediately after death the soul is judged and sent to join the
                                    ranks of the pious or of the wicked. Good souls dwell with
                                    Pluton and Persephone in perpetual light and happiness, the bad
                                    must endure anguish past beholding for punishment and
                                    purification. If they do not mend, they are sent back to earth,
                                    and after death come again before the inexorable judgment-seat.
                                    Those who are purified return to earth in the ninth year, and
                                    are made kings, heroes, sages. When a man has maintained himself
                                    in each of these transition stages, and has kept pure from all
                                    wrong, he becomes <pb n="150"/> a hero, and dwells forever in
                                    the islands of the blessed. (After Mezger.)</p>

                                    Schmidt follows. Equal nights and equal days may be equal to

                                    character&rdquo; seems to be the safest interpretation.
                                    &ldquo;The night shineth as the day; the darkness and the

                                    but their lives are freer from toil. This interpretation is

                                    writing this poem over S. and B., and hence this scornful and,
                                    we should say, ignoble note of superiority. As Simonides had
                                    just made peace between Hieron and Theron, it is very unlikely
                                    that P. should have made this arrogant fling at this time.</p>

                            <p>The third Olympian celebrates the same victory as the preceding ode.
                                In what order the two were sung does not appear. O. 2 was probably
                                performed in the palace of Theron; O. 3 in the Dioskureion of
                                Akragas. The superscription and the Scholia indicate that this ode
                                was prepared for the festival of the <foreign lang="greek"
                                    >*qeoce/nia</foreign>, at which Kastor and Polydeukes
                                entertained the gods. It is natural to assume the existence of a
                                special house-cult of the Dioskuroi in the family of the Emmenidai,
                                but we must not press v. 39 too hard.</p>
                            <p>The third Olympian, then, combines the epinikian ode with the
                                theoxenian hymn. The Tyndaridai are in the foreground. It is the
                                Tyndaridai that the poet seeks to please (v. 1) by his <foreign
                                    lang="greek">*)olumpioni/kas u(/mnos</foreign>. It is the
                                Tyndaridai, the twin sons of Leda (v. 35), that are the ruling
                                spirits of the Olympian contests. It is the Tyndaridai that are the
                                givers of fame to Theron (v. 39). The victory is the same as that
                                celebrated in the previous ode, but there Theron is always present
                                to our minds. We are always thinking of the third member of the
                                triad &mdash; god, hero, man. Here Theron is kept back. The poet
                                who was there almost, if not altogether, defiant in his heralding of
                                Theron, utters scarce a word of praise here. Before it was merit,
                                here it is grace.</p>
                            <p>The poem is a solemn banquet-hymn. The victory calls for the
                                fulfilment of a divine service, a <foreign lang="greek">qeo/dmaton
                                    xre/os</foreign> (v. 7). Pisa is the source of <foreign
                                    lang="greek">qeomoroi a)oidai/</foreign> (v. 10). The myth has
                                the same drift. It is the story of the Finding of the Olive, the
                                token of victory. This is no native growth. It was brought by
                                Herakles from the sources of the Istros, a memorial of Olympic
                                contests (v. 15). It was not won by force, but obtained by entreaty
                                from the Hyperborean servants of Apollo (v. 16), and the hero craved
                                it as shade for the sacred enclosure of his sire, and as a wreath
                                for human prowess (v. 18). Already had the games been established,
                                    <pb n="156"/> but the ground was bare to the keen scourgings of
                                the sun (v. 24). Sent to Istria on another errand by Zeus, he had
                                beheld and wondered (v. 32). Thither returning at the impulse of his
                                heart, he asked and received, and planted the olive at Olympia (v.
                                34), which he still visits with the sons of Leda (v. 35).</p>
                            <p>The parallel with Herakles is revealed at the end. Theron has reached
                                his bound &mdash; his Herakles' pillars. Beyond lies nothing.
                                Seek no further (v. 45).</p>
                            <p>The olive was a free gift of God. So is this victory of Theron. It
                                might be dangerous to press the details. Yet it is not unGreek to
                                say that the beauty of life is found of those who walk in the path
                                of duty. Theron's praise is no less because it is indirect.</p>
                            <p>The dactylo-epitrite rhythms are peculiarly appropriate in a hymn
                                addressed to deities so Dorian in their character as the Dioskuroi.
                                The compass of the strophe is not great, but especial stateliness is
                                given to the composition by the massiveness of the epode. It is
                                noteworthy that strophe and epode end with the same measure.</p>
                            <p>Of the three triads, the central one contains the heart of the
                                Finding of the Olive. The story is begun at the close of the first
                                triad, and finished at the beginning of the third, and thus the
                                parts are locked together.</p>

                            <p>Kamarina was founded by the Syracusans, 599 B.C., one hundred and
                                thirty-five years after Syracuse itself. Destroyed by Syracuse in
                                consequence of a revolt, it was some time afterwards restored by
                                Hippokrates. Again stripped of its inhabitants by Gelon, it was
                                rebuilt once more by men of Gela, Ol. 79, 4 (461 B.C.). The proverb

                                    a)mei/nwn</foreign> is supposed to refer to the unhealthy
                                situation of the city, but Lobeck reads <foreign lang="greek"

                            <p>Of Psaumis we know absolutely nothing, except what Pindar is pleased
                                to tell us in this ode and the next. Both odes are supposed to refer
                                to the same victory, <foreign lang="greek">a)ph/nh|</foreign>, that
                                is, with a mule chariot. The MSS. have in the superscription
                                    <foreign lang="greek">a(/rmati</foreign> or <foreign
                                    lang="greek">i(/ppois</foreign>: <foreign lang="greek"
                                >a)ph/nh|</foreign> is due to B&ouml;ckh's combinations. This
                                gives us a terminus. The mule-race was done away with, Ol. 84 (444
                                B.C.). B&ouml;ckh puts Psaumis's victory Ol. 82 (452 B.C.), and
                                maintains that the victor had failed in the four-horse chariot race,
                                and in the race with the single horse (<foreign lang="greek"
                                >ke/lhti</foreign>). The <foreign lang="greek">a)ph/nh|</foreign>
                                victory then was a consolation, and there seems to be a note of
                                disappointment in the rhythm.</p>
                            <p>According to B&ouml;ckh the ode was sung in Olympia; according to
                                Leopold Schmidt in Kamarina. The latter view seems to be the more
                                probable. The fourth ode was sung in the festal procession, the
                                fifth, the genuineness of which has been disputed, at the banquet.</p>
                            <p>The key of this brief poem is given, v. 16: <foreign lang="greek"
                                    >dia/peira/ toi brotw=n e)/legxos</foreign>. The final test is
                                the true test. Success may be slow in coming, but when it comes it
                                reveals the man. The thunderchariot of Zeus is an unwearied chariot.
                                What though his Horai revolve and revolve ere they bring the witness
                                of the lofty contest? Good fortune dawns, and then comes gratulation
                                forthwith. The light comes late, but it is a light that shines <pb
                                    n="163"/> from the chariot of a man who hastens to bring glory
                                to Kamarina. Well may we pray, &ldquo;God speed his other
                                wishes.&rdquo; Well may we praise the man &mdash; liberal,
                                hospitable, pure-souled, lover of peace, lover of his state. No
                                falsehood shall stain this record of a noble life. The final trial
                                is the test of mortals.</p>
                            <p>So, by trial, Erginos, the Argonaut, was saved from the reproach of
                                the Lemnian women. Unsuccessful before, he won the race in armor,
                                and said to Hypsipyle as he went after the crown: &ldquo;This is
                                what I am in swiftness. My hands and heart fully match my feet. The
                                race is for the young, but I am younger than my seeming. Gray hairs
                                grow often on young men before the time. The final trial is the test
                                of mortals.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>Psaumis had every virtue but success; now this is added. So Erginos
                                was a man of might, of courage; now he has shown his speed.</p>
                            <p>The logaoedic rhythms are handled so as to produce a peculiar effect.
                                Prolongation is frequent (<foreign lang="meter">3</foreign> for
                                    <foreign lang="meter">-u</foreign>), and the result is a
                                half-querulous, half-mocking tone. The lively Aiolian mood is
                                tempered by the plaintive Lydian. Psaumis is only half satisfied,
                                after all, and his enemies are not wholly confounded.</p>
                            <p>The triad distributes itself fairly into prayer, praise, and story.</p>

                            <p>The verse about which the poem revolves is v. 15: <foreign

                                    lang="greek">kindu/nw| kekalumme/non</foreign>. The preceding
                                poem dwells on the importance of the final trial (4, 16); this gives
                                the conditions of success, <foreign lang="greek">po/nos dapa/na
                                te</foreign>. The wain must be untiring (v. 3), the sacrifices great
                                and various (v. 6). To gain an Olympian victory, to found a new
                                city, costs toil and money. The flower of victory is sweet (<foreign

                                that the work is over, the price paid. So the daughter of Okeanos,
                                Kamarina, who is to greet the victor with laughing heart (v. 2), was
                                builded with much toil, much cost. The stately canals, the grove of
                                houses &mdash; these, like <foreign lang="greek"
                                >a)ph/nh</foreign>, like <foreign lang="greek">bouqusi/ai</foreign>,
                                were not made for naught. May blessings rest on city and on Olympian
                                victor! May the one have the adornment of the noble deeds of her
                                sons, the other a happy old age, with his sons clustering about him!
                                    <foreign lang="greek">po/nos dapa/na te</foreign> have brought
                                their reward. Wealth sufficient remains. Add fame. What more? Let
                                him not seek to become a god.</p>
                            <p>There is no myth. The founding of Kamarina is fairy-tale, is magic
                                achievement, enough.</p>
                            <p>This poem, short as it is, has given rise to much discussion. The
                                Breslau Scholiast (A) tells us that it was not in the <foreign
                                    lang="greek">e)da/fia</foreign> (original texts), but it was
                                considered Pindar's from the time of Didymos on. In O. 2 and 3 we
                                have two poems on one and the same victory, but the treatment is
                                very different, as we have seen. P. 4 and 5 celebrate the same
                                success, but different sides are turned out. Here, too, it might be
                                said that O. 4 dwells on the achievement, O. 5 on the conditions;
                                and O. 5 shows a more intimate acquaintance with local circumstances
                                than O. 4 does. But this makes it only the harder to understand the
                                resemblance in diction. <pb n="167"/> With <foreign lang="greek"

                                to remember the very narrow limits within which these resemblances,
                                some of them in themselves trifling, are crowded, and Pindar's
                                disinclination to repeat himself. In all P. <foreign lang="greek"

                                coincidence are remote. The poet must have had his own ode in mind,
                                or another &mdash; perhaps Pindar's local representative,

                                abroad as well as at home. The three triads have been compared to

                            <p>Agesias, son of Sostratos, was a Syracusan of the noble family of the
                                Iamidai, descendants of Iamos, son of Apollo. The Iamidai were
                                hereditary prophets among the Dorians, hereditary diviners at the
                                great altar of Zeus in Olympia. Early settlers of Italy and Sicily,
                                they retained their connection with Arkadia. Our Agesias, a citizen
                                of Syracuse, was also a citizen of Stymphalos. As a Syracusan he was
                                an active partisan of Hieron, and after the fall of the <foreign
                                    lang="xgreek">tyrannis</foreign> was put to death by the
                                Syracusans.</p>
                            <p>The composition of the ode cannot be earlier than Ol. 76, 1 (476
                                B.C.), nor later than Ol. 78, 1 (468 B.C.), the earliest and the
                                latest Olympian celebrations that fall within the reign of Hieron.
                                Ol. 77 (472 B.C.) is excluded, because Pindar was at that time in
                                Sicily, and the poem was composed in Greece. Ol. 78, 1 is the date
                                to which the ode is assigned by B&ouml;ckh. <foreign
                                    lang="greek">*zeu\s *ai)tnai=os</foreign> (v. 96) would seem
                                more appropriate after the founding of Aitna (Ol. 76). The arguments
                                advanced by Leop. Schmidt in support of the same date, such as the
                                character of vv. 58-63, which he regards as a feeble reflection of
                                    <bibl n="Pind. O. 1">O. 1.71</bibl>-85, and the confidential
                                tone in which Hieron is spoken of at the close, do not seem to be
                                cogent.</p>
                            <p>The ode was probably sung at Stymphalos and repeated at Syracuse. One
                                Aineas brought the poem from Thebes to Stymphalos, and directed the
                                performance. We do not know whether he was an assistant of Pindar's
                                or a local poet of the Iamid stock.</p>
                            <p>The verses to which one always comes back in thinking over this poem
                                are these (100, 101): <foreign lang="greek">a)gaqai\ de\ pe/lont'

                                In the second Olympian we have noticed a recurrent three; here there
                                is clearly a recurrent two. Agesias, the hero of the poem, unites in
                                his person <pb n="172"/> Syracusan and Stymphalian. At Olympia he is
                                victor in the games and steward of an oracle (vv. 4, 5). At Syracuse
                                he is <foreign lang="greek">sunoikisth/s</foreign> of the city and
                                beloved of the citizens (vv. 6, 7). He is prince and prophet, as
                                Amphiaraos (v. 13) was warrior and prophet, and his victory must be
                                celebrated at Pitana (v. 28), as it must be celebrated at Syracuse
                                (v. 99). His charioteer, Phintis (v. 22), must speed to the banks of
                                the Eurotas, and Pindar's leader, Aineas (v. 88), must conduct the
                                festal song. Agesias's maternal stock was Arkadian; from thence came
                                his prophetic blood &mdash; from Euadne, daughter of Poseidon
                                (v. 29), a prophetic god; from Iamos (v. 43), whom Euadne bore to
                                Apollo, a prophetic god.</p>
                            <p>The myth of Iamos (vv. 29-70) shows the value of this double help
                                &mdash; the result, a double treasure of prophecy. Prosperity
                                and fame attend the Iamidai. Herakles helped Iamos at Olympia (v.
                                68); Hermes the Iamidai in Arkadia (v. 79). Thebes and Stymphalos
                                are akin (v. 86), as Herakles, Boeotian hero, and Hermes, Arkadian
                                god, unite to bless the Iamidai. So the song must praise Hera (v.
                                88), for Arkadia was the home of her virginity, and vindicate
                                Boeotia, home of Herakles (v. 90); must remember Syracuse, and wish
                                the victor a happy reception in one home as he comes from another
                                home &mdash; as he comes from Arkadia to Syracuse (v. 99). He
                                has two homes in joy &mdash; two anchors in storm. God bless
                                this and that (<foreign lang="greek">tw=nde kei/nwn te kluta\n

                            <p>This is one of the most magnificent of Pindar's poems, full of color,
                                if not so dazzling as the seventh Olympian. The myth of Iamos, the
                                    <foreign lang="greek">ma/ntis</foreign> ancestor of a <foreign
                                    lang="greek">ma/ntis</foreign>, is beautifully told. Profound
                                moral there is none to me discernible. &ldquo;He that hath gods
                                on either side of his ancestry shall have the gods to right and
                                left, of him for aye,&rdquo; shows an aristocratic belief in

                            <p>There is such a ganglion of personal and tribal relations involved in
                                this piece that one is tempted to long historical and antiquarian
                                disquisitions; but if we accept Pindar's statement as to the
                                connection between Thebes and Arkadia, nothing more is necessary to
                                the enjoyment of the ode. <pb n="173"/></p>

                                second takes us to Arkadia, and begins the story of Iamos, which is
                                continued in the third and the fourth. The latter half of the fourth
                                prepares the return to Syracuse, which forms the conclusion of the

                                leaders were descendants of Tlepolemos, son of Herakles, and Pindar
                                makes Tlepolemos himself the founder of the colony. The Herakleidai
                                occupied three cities of Rhodes, and established a triple kingdom.
                                Those who inhabited Ialysos were called Eratidai, and this was the
                                stock of Diagoras, who also counted among his ancestors a son-in-law

                                the work of Kallikles of Megara, was erected at Olympia; and
                                familiar is the story of the Spartan who, when he saw Diagoras borne
                                on the shoulders of his two laurelled sons, exclaimed,
                                &ldquo;Die, Diagoras, for thou canst not mount to
                                heaven&rdquo; (<bibl n="Cic. Tusc. 1.41.111">Cic. Tusc. 1, 46,
                                    111</bibl>). It is not known whether Diagoras followed the
                                advice or lived to see the downfall of his family. Rhodes belonged
                                to the Delian league. Two years before the victory here celebrated
                                the battles of Eurymedon <pb n="183"/> were fought (466), and Athens
                                was at the height of her power. Enemies of aristocratic government,
                                the Athenians favored the commons as against the Doric aristocracy
                                of Rhodes. Diagoras's son, Dorieus, fled to Thurioi, but returned
                                and fought against the Athenians in his own ships, was captured, but
                                liberated. Again exiled, he went to the Peloponnesos, where he was
                                arrested by the Spartans and executed. But these events befell many
                                years after the date of the victory celebrated in this ode.</p>
                            <p>The good fortune of Diagoras was proverbial. The <foreign lang="la"
                                    >Morere, Diagora</foreign> of Cicero's version of his story,
                                cited above, is in the school-books. But if we had no evidence
                                outside of this ode, we should know by Pindar's recital that his
                                career was brilliant, as his home was brilliant &mdash; Rhodes,
                                child of Aphrodite, bride of the sun (v. 14). No wonder that the
                                golden beaker and the foaming wine are used to symbolize the song in
                                honor of such a victor and such a home (v. 1, foll.). But there must
                                be shade as well as light. Nemesis does not allow too much
                                happiness, and in the history of the line of Diagoras, Pindar finds
                                enough trouble for contrast, each trouble ending in higher joy. So,
                                should the happiness of Diagoras ever be interrupted, there is good
                                hope of more than recompense. Tlepolemos, founder of the house, slew
                                the brother of Alkmena &mdash; passion had overmastered him (v.
                                27) &mdash; but Apollo sent him to Rhodes, where he received
                                &ldquo;sweet ransom for grievous disaster&rdquo; (v. 77).
                                The sons of Helios, lord of Rhodes, were bidden to raise an altar to
                                Athena and sacrifice to the Great Sire and the Warrior-maid. Wise as
                                they were, they forgot fire, and offered flameless sacrifices. Yet
                                the gods forgave; Zeus sent them gold, Athena cunning craft (vv.
                                39-53). Helios himself, pure god, was absent at the partition of the
                                earth; yet he received a boon that he himself preferred to all
                                besides (vv. 54-76). In each of these three cases we have a good
                                beginning followed by misfortune, and yet a good ending crowns all.
                                Diagoras was fortunate. Both <foreign lang="greek">a)reta/</foreign>
                                and <foreign lang="greek">xa/rmata</foreign> were his (cf. v. 44),
                                but he might one day forget; he trod a noble path, <foreign
                                    lang="greek">u(/brios e)xqra\n o(do/n</foreign> (v. 90), but
                                passion might overtake him; he was a prince among men as Helios was
                                a prince among gods, but he might, in his absence, be forgotten; but
                                should Nemesis have aught against Diagoras, he may yet hope to find,
                                like Tlepolemos, like the sons of Helios, like Helios himself,
                                    <foreign lang="greek">lu/tron sumfora=s oi)ktra=s
                                gluku/</foreign> (v. 77). <pb n="184"/> The winds shift (v. 95), but
                                the divine helmsman steers the ship to its haven.</p>
                            <p>A remarkable feature of the myth is the reversal of the usual
                                chronological order. We begin with Tlepolemos and end with the
                                emergence of Rhodes. The climax is in the rank of those who have
                                sinned, who have forgotten, who have been absent. Note that the
                                fault is less the higher we mount. No wonder that an explanation has
                                been sought of the triple shadow that falls across the poem. The
                                Scholiast on v. 94 assumes that Diagoras had got into discredit by
                                killing one of his opponents. But this must have been in some
                                previous contest, for in such an event there would have been no
                                victory, as is shown by the case of Kleomedes (Paus. 6, 9, 6). The
                                shadow may come from the future, as has been assumed above, but
                                there is danger of being a <foreign lang="greek">*promhqeu\s meta\

                                ominous. The changing breezes of the close may bring good as well as

                                &mdash; Tlepolemos, the Heliadai, Helios himself. The last triad
                                turns to Diagoras. The divisions are all clear-cut, the triads do
                                not overlap &mdash; a rare thing in Pindar.</p>

                                    It was to this fame that Rhodes owed her prosperity. Pindar

                                    craftsman in mediaeval legends. All these miracles of art, says

                            <p>The victory celebrated in this ode was gained Ol. 80 (460 B.C.) by
                                Alkimedon of Aigina. We know nothing about the victor except what
                                Pindar tells us. He was a Blepsiad (v. 75) of the stock of Aiakos,
                                son of Zeus. There had been much sickness in the family (v. 85). He
                                had lost his father, Iphion (v. 81); his uncle, Kallimachos (v. 82).
                                His grandfather was still living (v. 70). His brother, Timosthenes,
                                had won a Nemean victory (v. 15). His teacher was the famous trainer
                                Melesias, who is mentioned <bibl n="Pind. N. 4">N. 4.93</bibl>
                                and 6, 74. There is much dispute whether Alkimedon was an <foreign
                                    lang="greek">e)/fedros</foreign> or not. See v. 68.</p>
                            <p>The song seems to have been sung immediately after the victory during
                                the procession to the altar of Zeus in the Altis.</p>
                            <p>Pindar knew Aigina well, and the universal of the Aiginetan odes is
                                often so pegged in the knotty entrails of the particular that it is
                                hard to set it free. The victory is the victory of a boy, and the
                                    <foreign lang="greek">a)lei/pths</foreign>, who is entitled to a
                                fair share of the praise in all the boy-odes, seems to have a
                                disproportionate space allotted to him. As an Athenian, Melesias had
                                a certain amount of odium to encounter, and P. found it necessary to
                                vindicate him by recounting the successes of Melesias as well as the
                                successes of those whom he had trained. Mezger sees in the ode a
                                jubilee-tribute to Melesias for the thirtieth victory of his pupils
                                (v. 66) &mdash; a notion more German than Greek.</p>
                            <p>After an invocation of Olympia as the mistress of truth, by reason of
                                the happy issue of the oracle delivered by the diviners at the great
                                altar of Zeus (vv. 1-10), the poet says: There are other blessings,
                                but Olympia's prize is the chief. There are other gods, but Zeus is
                                the patron of the Blepsiadai, head of their race (v. 16). Themis,
                                the glory of Aigina, sits by the side of Zeus (v. 22). Apollo, son
                                of Zeus, Poscidon, brother of Zeus, take Zeus's son Aiakos to Troy
                                (v. 31). Then the poet tells the story of Aiakos to show what honor
                                Zeus puts on his son. Aiakos is <pb n="193"/>
                                <foreign lang="greek">sunergo/s</foreign> to the gods (v. 32), and
                                    <foreign lang="greek">*zhni\ geneqli/w|</foreign> (v. 16) is
                                echoed in <foreign lang="greek">*zeu\s ge/nei</foreign> (v. 83). So
                                far the poem runs smoothly enough, and if the poet had returned to
                                the victor after despatching Aiakos to Aigina, the ode would be less
                                difficult; but the introduction of the trainer jars us, and, in
                                fact, Pindar himself apologizes for it (v. 56). Timosthenes, who
                                ordered the ode &mdash; Alkimedon is nowhere addressed, and his
                                youth is emphasized &mdash; required this mention of Melesias,
                                who must have been his trainer too; and so Pindar dwells on the
                                importance of having an old athlete as a trainer both for man (v.
                                63) and boy, both for Timosthenes and for Alkimedon. This brings
                                Alkimedon forward again, but he is soon lost again in the mention of
                                his race &mdash; in the mention of the dead sire, who hears in
                                the other world the glory that has come to the house.</p>
                            <p>The prose line of thought would be: The blessing of Zeus on Aiakos
                                was on children's children; and so the brothers, Timosthenes,
                                trained by Melesias, and now Alkimedon, have gained the prize, at
                                Nemea one, at Olympia the other, both in games of Zeus, and even in
                                the lower world the gracious boon is not unknown.</p>
                            <p>The poem is full of prayers, but Aigina was near the point when she
                                would be past praying for.</p>
                            <p>The rhythms are dactylo-epitrite. According to B&ouml;ckh the
                                mood is a mixture of Dorian and Lydian, in which we should have the
                                blending of sadness with manly joy.</p>
                            <p>Of the four triads, the first is introductory; the second contains
                                the brief myth; the last two are divided between Timosthenes,
                                Melesias's patron, who ordered the ode, and Alkimedon, who won the
                                victory.</p>

                                    The contrast is between the life of the gods and the life of
                                    men. Apollo is happy in three places, Poseidon in two. But human
                                    beings are not equally happy everywhere. Timosthenes was
                                    victorious at Nemea, Alkimedon at Olympia. An Athenian would not
                                    be at home in Aigina, nor an Aiginetan at Athens. This
                                    commonplace prepares, after a fashion, the way for the
                                    inevitable mention of Melesias.</p>

                                    teaching art; he hath practised what he taught. If he taught
                                    boys to win, he himself won as a boy a wrestling-match; nay, won
                                    afterwards, as a man, the pankration. To train is easier for him

                            <p>The date of this ode is uncertain, and the Scholiasts are at
                                variance. According to B&ouml;ckh the victory was won Ol. 81
                                (456 B.C.), shortly after a Pythian victory, Ol. 80, 3 (458 B.C.),
                                which is celebrated in this ode together with the Olympian one (v.
                                13). Leopold Schmidt finds that B&ouml;ckh's computation agrees
                                with his theory of P.'s poetical decline. Fennell puts the date
                                Pyth. 30 (468 B.C.), acc. to one Scholiast, on the ground that at
                                the later date (456) the Lokrian oligarchy was threatened, if not
                                overthrown, by the Athenians. Cf. <bibl n="Thuc. 1.108">Thuk. 1,
                                108</bibl>. Besides his many local successes, Epharmostos had been
                                victorious in all the great national games, and was, consequently, a
                                    <foreign lang="greek">periodoni/khs</foreign>. Pindar tells us
                                all we know of him &mdash; his noble personal appearance (v.
                                119), his ancient stock (v. 58), his intimacy with Lampromachos,
                                also a friend of Pindar's (v. 90).</p>
                            <p>The song was sung in Opus at a festival of Aias Oiliades. The
                                assumption of a banquet gives more point to v. 52. The Lokrians are
                                better known to us through the Epizephyrian representatives of the
                                stock than by the members of the family that remained in Central
                                Greece, and for us Opuntian Lokris is more lighted up by this ode of
                                Pindar's (v. 24) than by the rude inscriptions, which doubtless give
                                a false impression of the people (Hicks, Hist. Inscr. No. 63).
                                Writing may be rude, and song, for which the Lokrians were famous,
                                refined. The position of woman among the Lokrians seems to have been
                                exceptionally influential, and even one who knew nothing of Lokris
                                and the Lokrians could hardly fail to be struck by the predominance
                                of woman in this ode. Pindar is a manner of
                                &ldquo;Frauenlob,&rdquo; at any rate, but here
                                &ldquo;das Ewig-Weibliche&rdquo; is paramount. Archilochos
                                does not suffice; we must have the Muses (v. 5). Lydian Pelops is
                                mentioned for the sake of the dowry of his bride, Hippodameia (v.
                                10). Themis and Eunomia (v. 15) are the patronesses of the renowned
                                city, mother of the Lokrians (v. 22). <pb n="202"/> The city is the
                                city of Protogeneia (v. 44). Opus, son of Zeus and an Epeian heroine
                                (v. 62), bore the name of his mother's father (v. 67). When
                                Menoitios is mentioned, his mother is not forgotten (v. 75);
                                Achilles is only Thetis's son (v. 82).</p>
                            <p>The fundamental thought is <foreign lang="greek">to\ de\ fua=|
                                    kra/tiston a(/pan</foreign> (v. 107). It matters not that in the
                                previous song P. had sung: <foreign lang="greek">a)/gnwmon de\ to\

                                8.60</bibl>). Here no Melesias is to be praised. The <foreign
                                    lang="greek">fua/</foreign> comes from God; hence P. sings,
                                    <foreign lang="greek">a)/neu de\ qeou= sesigame/non ou)
                                    skaio/teron xrh=m' e(/kaston</foreign> (v. 111). The poem is
                                full of the strange dealings, the wonderful workings of the deities,
                                of the Supreme, culminating in the story of Protogeneia and her son.
                                The fortune of Lydian Pelops (v. 10) reminds us of Poseidon. The
                                dowry of Hippodameia was a gift of God, as Pindar's garden of song
                                was allotted him by Fate (v. 28). The Charites are the bestowers of
                                all that is pleasant. Men are good and wise according to the will of
                                Heaven (v. 30). If Herakles withstood the gods themselves (v. 32),
                                it is clear that there was a greater god within him. That god was
                                Zeus, and P., after deprecating impiety toward the gods, tells of
                                the marvels Zeus hath wrought. Behold the miracle of the stones
                                raised up as seed to Deukalion and Pyrrha. That is the decree of
                                Zeus, <foreign lang="greek">ai)olobro/nta *dio\s ai)/sa|</foreign>
                                (v. 45). Behold the deluge abated. That is the device of Zeus,
                                    <foreign lang="greek">*zhno\s te/xnais</foreign> (v. 56).
                                Protogeneia is caught up (v. 62). Zeus interferes again to give life
                                to the dying house (v. 64).</p>
                            <p>Epharmostos has been singularly favored by nature and fortune. Nature
                                and fortune mean God, and the narrative of his successes closes the
                                poem with a recognition of the divine decree that made him quick of
                                hand, ready of limb, and valorous of eye.</p>
                            <p>The Lokrian or Aiolian (logaoedic) rhythms are light and festive.
                                They whirr like arrows (v. 12), they flame (v. 24), they speed
                                faster than mettlesome horse or winged ship (v. 25).</p>
                            <p>The first triad contains the introduction. The myth, the story of the
                                heroine who made Opus what it was, is announced in the first epode,
                                the theme of which is continued in the second triad. After unfolding
                                his moral (<foreign lang="greek">a)gaqoi\ de\ kai\ sofoi\ kata\
                                    dai/mon' a)/ndres e)ge/nonto</foreign>), P. resumes the myth, v.
                                44, tells of Deukalion and Pyrrha and the stone-folk, and the union
                                of Zeus and the ancestress of Opus and the Opuntian nobles. About
                                the city thus founded gathered nobles of different Grecian lands,
                                chief of them Menoitios, father of Patroklos. From this story, which
                                shows what <pb n="203"/> God can do, P. passes, at the close of the
                                third triad, to the achievements of the descendants of this favored
                                stock, and, in the last triad, recounts the exploits of Epharmostos.</p>

                                    seems to have been very familiar with local myths of the
                                    Lokrians. The story as told by <pb n="206"/> Mezger, after
                                    B&ouml;ckh and Bossler, is as follows: Deukalion and Pyrrha,
                                    grandchildren of Iapetos (compare Hor. <quote lang="la">Iapeti
                                        genus</quote>) escape the deluge by taking refuge on
                                    Parnasos. When the waters subsided, by the devices of Zeus (v.
                                    56), they descended from the mountain (v. 46) to Opus, where, in
                                    consequence of an oracle of Zeus, they founded the first town
                                    (v. 47), and made the Stone people. To these belonged
                                    &ldquo;the hundred mothers&rdquo; from whom the Lokrian
                                    nobles were descended, as, indeed, the prominence of women among
                                    the Lokrians generally is a significant fact. The royal race to
                                    which Epharmostos is supposed to have belonged traced their
                                    descent from Deukalion and Pyrrha down to Lokros in the male
                                    line, and from his adopted son Opus in the female. Lokros was
                                    the last of his house, and the race was about to die out with
                                    him, but Zeus carried off Protogeneia, daughter of Opus of Elis,
                                    and granddaughter of Protogeneia, daughter of Deukalion and
                                    Pyrrha; was united to her in the Mainalian mountains, and
                                    brought her to the childless Lokros, her cousin, as his wife.
                                    Lokros called the offspring of the younger Protogeneia after her
                                    father Opus, and gave him the throne. The fame of Opus spread,
                                    and many settlers came to him, none dearer than Menoitios.</p>

                            <p>The victory celebrated in this ode was gained by Agesidamos, a boy
                                boxer, son of Archestratos of Epizephyrian Lokris, Ol. 74 (484
                                B.C.). The following ode (11), composed on the same theme, and
                                produced at Olympia immediately after the victory, was put after the
                                longer ode in the MSS., because it was fancied to be the <foreign
                                    lang="greek">to/kos</foreign> mentioned v. 11. This longer poem
                                was sent to Lokris some time afterwards. There is nothing to measure
                                the interval that elapsed, and the poet's expressions of contrition
                                at the long delay must be construed poetically. Hermann and Mommsen
                                assign it to the next Olympiad, De Jongh and Fennell, who see in v.
                                15 an allusion to Anaxilas of Rhegion (see <ref target="o1"
                                    targOrder="U">Introd. O. 1</ref>), would put it Ol. 76.</p>
                            <p>L&uuml;bbert has written an elaborate essay (Kiel, 1881) to prove
                                that Pindar gave this detailed account of the institution of the
                                Olympian games by the Theban Herakles in distinct opposition to the
                                traditions of the Eleian priests, who referred the establishment of
                                the games to the Idaian Herakles, and the Dactyls, his brothers. See
                                Paus. 8, 7, 6. Lobeck and others consider the Eleian legend a late
                                invention, but L&uuml;bbert has proved the great antiquity of
                                Idaian sites in the Peloponnesos, and this theory gives a more
                                plausible explanation of the detail here presented than the
                                gratuitous assumption that the poet went into all these particulars
                                for the benefit of the Epizephyrian Lokrians, as if the
                                Epizephyrians did not have traditions of their own. As a champion of
                                the glory of the Theban Herakles against all comers. Pindar appears
                                in a very natural light.</p>
                            <p>The words which form the key to the poem lock the third antistrophe
                                and the third epode together, <foreign lang="greek">o(/ t'
                                    e)cele/gxwn mo/nos</foreign> &verbar; <foreign lang="greek"

                                    lang="greek">*xro/nos</foreign> (v. 59). The poet begins by
                                acknowledging a debt: Time shamed him. The truth of the first
                                Olympian games was hidden: Time revealed it. The melody was <pb
                                    n="213"/> long suppressed: Time brought it at last, as welcome
                                as the son with whom the wife rewards the long-expectant love of the
                                aging sire. Time brings roses, Time crowns renewed effort. So
                                Herakles suffers repulse. So Agesidamos has a hard struggle, but
                                both succeed at last. <foreign lang="greek">*xro/nos ga\r eu)marh\s
                                    qeo/s</foreign> (Soph.).</p>
                            <p>The poem was written in fulfilment of a promise, in payment of a debt
                                which the poet poetically feigns that he has forgotten (v. 4). He
                                calls on the bystanders to read the ledger of his heart and see
                                where his creditor stands written; he calls on the Muse (Memory) and
                                Truth, the daughter of Zeus, to keep from him the reproach of
                                falsehood (v. 6). Time has brought the blush of shame to him for
                                this heavy arrear of debt (v. 7), but usury can make good the
                                failure of prompt payment (v. 11). The tide of song will wash away
                                the pebble-counters into the depths of poesy, and the debt due to
                                Agesidamos and to Lokris shall be settled, and favor gained besides
                                with Faithfulness, who inhabits the city of the Zephyrian Lokrians,
                                with Kalliope, who is dear to them, as also mail-clad Ares (v. 15).
                                But the poet is not the only one in debt. Agesidamos would have
                                failed, as Herakles failed in the fight with Kyknos, had not Ilas
                                helped him (v. 19). So let him pay his debt of gratitude to Ilas as
                                Patroklos his to Achilles. Native valor, training sharp, and God's
                                favor can raise a mortal to great fame. Only some few reach joy
                                without toil, light without darkness (v. 25). This tribute paid to
                                Ilas for the training sharp, the decrees of Zeus urge the poet to
                                pay another debt &mdash; the debt due to Herakles for the
                                establishment of the games hard by the ancient tomb of Pelops
                                &mdash; and the heart of the poem is occupied with a detailed
                                account of the origin of the Olympian games and the first
                                celebration (vv. 27-85). Herakles is not the Herakles of Peisandros
                                    (<bibl n="Pind. O. 9.32">O. 9.32</bibl>); he is not a lonely
                                knight-errant, he is the leader of a host. The version here given
                                bears on its face the impress of a strong local stamp. It is not the
                                common story, that is evident; and the poet draws a sly parallel
                                between his forgotten debts written on the tables of his heart,
                                which Time reveals to his shame (<foreign lang="greek"
                                >xro/nos</foreign>, v. 8) and the truth which Time has brought to
                                light (<foreign lang="greek">*xro/nos</foreign>, v. 61). The
                                victors, so far as they can be traced, are all in the belt of the
                                Peloponnesos with which the Lokris of the mother-country had
                                affinity. Arkadia is prominent, Tegea is there (v. 73), and
                                Mantineia (v. 77), and the conclusion bears the broad mark of the
                                device of the Lokrians &mdash; the thunderbolt (vv. 86-91). <pb

                            <p>At the close, P. sings how welcome the song must be in coming, as a
                                late child of one's old age; and well it may, for song alone gives
                                immortality. And now he has fulfilled his promise. He has praised
                                the Lokrians, he has praised the son of Archestratos, a vigorous
                                prizer and a Ganymede for beauty (v. 115).</p>
                            <p>The debt is paid, as debts should be paid, with cheeriness, if not
                                with promptness. The Aiolian (logaoedic) rhythms are gay, lilting.
                                The poem ends fitly with <foreign lang="greek"

                                the central three. There is a little overlapping, but not so much as

                                    he had seized the victims destined for the Delphian shrine. So
                                    Stesichoros. The poem was doubtless familiar to the Lokrians.
                                    The nexus is not over-clear. It is tolerably evident, however,
                                    that the victory of Agesidamos was gained after a hard struggle.
                                    In the first encounter Kyknos was aided by his father, Ares, and
                                    Herakles fled acc. to the proverb, <foreign lang="greek">ou)de\

                                    Agesidamos, found his one adversary too much for him, and he

                                    >Introduction to the preceding one</ref>, where B&ouml;ckh's
                                view has been followed. Leop. Schmidt calls it a promissory note,
                                while the old arrangers imagined it to be interest on deferred
                                payment. This is the first Olympian victory celebrated by Pindar,
                                and Schmidt thinks that P. shows great satisfaction at receiving the
                                commission. This may be true, but Schmidt does not succeed in
                                explaining why P. should have postponed the execution so long.</p>
                            <p>The thought of the poem is, &ldquo;Song, God-given, is the true
                                complement of God-given victory.&rdquo; There is a time for all
                                things; time for winds, for showers. The time of all for song is
                                when success is achieved by help of toil; then 'tis a beginning of
                                fame hereafter, a sworn warranty of great achievements. High above
                                envy is dedicated this praise for Olympian victors. This glory my
                                tongue would fain feed full, but 'tis God alone can give a heart of
                                wisdom. This glory I can sing as an adornment over and above thy
                                olive wreath and foster the name of the Lokrian stock. There revel,
                                ye Muses, for I will be bound that it is an hospitable race,
                                acquainted with beauty, wise to the highest point, and warlike. Nor
                                fox nor lion changes nature.</p>
                            <p>The rhythms are Dorian (dactylo-epitrite). Leop. Schmidt remarks on
                                the inferior impressiveness and majesty of the rhythms as compared
                                with other poems. However that may be, the proportion of dactyls is
                                unusually small, though about the same as in O. 12, which belongs to
                                the period of full maturity. B&ouml;ckh says: <quote lang="la"

                            <p>The strophe sets forth the importance of the song, the antistrophe
                                the divine calling of the poet, the epode the noble stock of the
                                victor. Thus this brief poem contains all the elements of the

                                </cit>), though the Cretans seldom took part in the Greek national
                                games. After the victories mentioned in this ode (v. 17), Ergoteles
                                won another Olympian (Ol. 78), and two Nemean contests (Paus. 6, 4,
                                11). The poem itself tells us that he had been driven from Crete by
                                political faction, and as Sicily was the land of promise to the
                                eastern Greeks, and especially those of Dorian stock, we may
                                dispense with a closer investigation. From the Scholiast we learn
                                that he arrived at Himera when a quarrel between Gelon and Hieron
                                was at its height. Himera was hardly more quiet than his old home,
                                but he succeeded in acquiring citizenship and the jealously guarded
                                right of holding real estate.</p>
                            <p>The twelfth Olympian is a short occasional poem. It has no room for a
                                myth, unless we consider the simile of the homefighting cock an
                                equivalent (v. 14). The simple thought is the domination of
                                Tych&eacute;. At the beck of Tych&eacute; ships are piloted
                                on the deep, stormy wars and councils guided on land. Men's hopes
                                are ships that roll through seas of idle plans, now high, now low.
                                The future no god hath pledged, no man hath seen. The hoped-for
                                pleasure is reversed, and from the battle with a sea of trouble men
                                pass in a moment's space to joy profound (vv. 1-12).</p>
                            <p>So Philanor's son, like some home-fighting cock, would have had only
                                homely fame, and the garland for the swiftness of his feet had shed
                                its leaves unheralded, had no hostile faction bereft him of his
                                Knosian fatherland. Now he hath gained a wreath at Olympia, two at
                                Pytho, two on the Isthmus. Now he magnifies <pb n="225"/> the city
                                of the Nymphs' hot baths. Now he dwells amid broad acres of his own
                                (vv. 13-19).</p>
                            <p>The sea plays an important part in this ode, as might be expected for
                                many reasons &mdash; the distance that separates Ergoteles from
                                Olympia, the distance that separates his old home and his new. There
                                is something symbolic of the vicissitudes of Fortune in the numerous
                                antitheses. The poem rocks like a ship. The deep, the land
                                &mdash; wars, councils &mdash; up, down &mdash; no
                                pledge from God, no foresight of man &mdash; pleasure reversed,
                                pain redeemed.</p>
                            <p>Himera and Ergoteles are paralleled. The city and the victor mirror
                                each other. The fortune of Himera is the fortune of Ergoteles.</p>
                            <p>The rhythms are dactylo-epitrite. B&ouml;ckh calls the mood a
                                mixture of Dorian and Lydian. The parts of the triad are clearcut.
                                The first deals with the domination of Tych&eacute;, the second
                                reinforces the theme of the uncertainty of human plans, the third
                                makes a practical and comforting application of these reflections to
                                the case of Ergoteles.</p>

                                    were popular in Greece. Pindar knew the cocks of Tanagra as well

                            <p>The thirteenth Olympian commemorates the victory of Xenophon of
                                Corinth in both stadion and pentathlon, Ol. 79 (464 B.C.).
                                Xenophon's father, before him, had won a foot-race at Olympia, Ol.
                                69 (504 B.C.); hence <foreign lang="greek">trisolumpioni/kan
                                oi)=kon</foreign> (v. 1). Indeed, the whole house of the
                                Oligaithidai, to which Xenophon belonged, was illustrious almost
                                beyond compare in Greece for their successes at the different games.
                                The wealth of the family is shown by Xenophon's vow to consecrate a
                                hundred <foreign lang="greek">e(tai=rai</foreign> as <foreign
                                    lang="greek">i(ero/douloi</foreign> to Aphrodite, which

                                *moi=sa</foreign> did not fail to glorify. See fr. IX. 1.</p>
                            <p>The splendor and wealth of Corinth were proverbial, and as the
                                seventh Olympian glitters with the light of the sun, so the
                                thirteenth reflects the riches of <foreign lang="greek">a( o)lbi/a
                                    *ko/rinqos</foreign> (v. 4). The first impression of the poem is
                                that of a semi - Oriental bazaar. It seems to be profuse in the
                                admired disorder of its wares. But there is, after all, a certain
                                Greek symmetry. Victor and victor's city mirror each other as
                                elsewhere (O. 12), and the hero of Corinth, Bellerophon, sums up the
                                highest of both. For wealth and success, without wisdom, without
                                courage, are vulgar. The sister spirits of Law, of Justice, of
                                Peace, daughters of Right, are the guardians of Corinth's wealth (v.
                                7). The achievements of the games abroad are balanced by inventions
                                at home (v. 17). The dithyramb first rose upon the air in Corinth.
                                The bit that rules the horse was first planned in Corinth. The
                                temple's summit first received the adornment of the king of birds in
                                Corinth. Here are three great inventions matching Eunomia, Dika, and
                                Eirena &mdash; matching the three Olympian victories of the
                                Oligaithidai. The Muse with the sweet breath and Ares with his
                                embattled hosts of youthful warriors are both at home in Corinth (v.
                                23).</p>
                            <p>If Corinth abounds in wealth, in art &mdash; if Corinth claims
                                the <pb n="228"/> honor of invention, her sons prosper, too. Keep, O
                                Zeus, the people unharmed, fill the sails of Xenophon with a
                                favoring breeze. <foreign lang="greek">a(/pan d' eu(ro/ntos
                                e)/rgon</foreign> (v. 17) is true of him. He gained the pentathlon
                                and the stadion in one day, which mortal man never attained before
                                (v. 31). Then comes a long list of the victories of Xenophon and his
                                house, until the poet finds himself in feud with many concerning the
                                number of these honors, and swears that he cannot count the sands of
                                the sea (v. 46). The time has come to put a bound, and so he returns
                                to Corinth and tells the story of Bellerophon (vv. 63-92),
                                forerunner of Xenophon &mdash; Bellerophon who mounted the
                                height of heaven on a winged steed, so that it might have been said
                                of him as of Xenophon: <foreign lang="greek">a)ntebo/lhsen</foreign>
                                &verbar; <foreign lang="greek">tw=n a)nh\r qnato\s ou)/pw tis
                                    pro/teron</foreign> (v. 31).</p>
                            <p>The myth concluded, the poet again tries to sum up the achievements
                                of the Oligaithidai in a few words, but the line stretches beyond
                                his sight, <foreign lang="greek">ma/sson' h)\ w(s i)de/men</foreign>
                                (v. 113). Swim out of this sea of glory with nimble feet. In highest
                                fortune, as in trembling suspense (O. 8), there is but one resource,
                                and that is prayer. Zeus, Perfecter, give reverence with enjoyment
                                (v. 115).</p>
                            <p>So the spirit of control regulates both the end and the beginning of
                                the ode. The dominant thought is <foreign lang="greek">e(/petai d'

                            <p>The measures are logaoedic.</p>
                            <p>The distribution of the five triads is not the common one. The first
                                triad is devoted to Corinth, the second to Xenophon, the third and
                                fourth to Bellerophon and his ancestors, the fifth to the
                                Oligaithidai. Mezger calls attention to the fact that the subjects
                                fall strictly within each triad. P. was evidently deepladen with his
                                commission, which must have come from the whole house, whose praises
                                he distributes as best he may. The later successes, Xenophon's and
                                his father's, are put first; the earlier, those of the Oligaithidai
                                generally, are put last.</p>

                                    during the reign of Periander. The Bacchic joyance is the main
                                    thing, and we must not hold P. to a strict account when he
                                    attributes the origin of the dithyramb, as he does elsewhere,

                                    The words would seem to mean naturally that two eagles were <pb

                                    supposes that the name was due to the eagle here mentioned.
                                    Another explanation is that the Corinthians filled the
                                    pediments, naked before, with the figure of an eagle, which
                                    subsequently gave way to groups of statuary. The name <foreign

                            <p>Orchomenos, in Boeotia, was a very ancient city, the home of the
                                famous Minyai (v. 4), where the Charites were worshipped from the
                                earliest times. The poem, as we have it, contains scarcely more than
                                an invocation and exaltation of the Charites, and an announcement of
                                the Olympian victory of the boy Asopichos, who won the single-dash
                                foot-race, Ol. 76 (476 B.C.). This victory Echo is bidden report to
                                the father of Asopichos, who is now in the abode of Persephone.
                                While the poem closes well, the massive structure of the strophe
                                gives the piece the effect of a torso.</p>
                            <p>The song is supposed to have been sung in a procession (<foreign

                            <p>The metres are logaoedic. The mood is said by the poet himself to be
                                Lydian (v. 17). The soft Lydian measure was especially suited to
                                boys' voices (<foreign lang="greek">pre/pei th=| tw=n pai/dwn

                                adapted to the close of the poem, in which the dead father of the

                            <p>The victory commemorated in this poem was gained Pyth. 29, i. e. Ol.
                                76, 3 (474 B.C.). Hieron had himself proclaimed as a citizen of
                                Aitna in order to please the city founded by him, Ol. 76, 1 (476
                                B.C.), to take the place of Katana. In the same year he had gained a
                                victory over the Etruscans off Cumae, thus crowning the glory of the
                                battle of Himera. The great eruption of Aitna, which began Ol. 75, 2
                                (479 B.C.), and continued several years, figures largely in this
                                poem, which has been much admired and often imitated, notably by
                                Gray in his &ldquo;Progress of Poesy.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>Pindar's poems are constellations. There are figures as in the
                                heavens, a belt, a plough, a chair, a serpent, a flight of doves,
                                but around them clusters much else. The Phorminx is the name of the
                                constellation called the first Pythian. In the first part of the
                                poem the lyre is the organ of harmony, in the second the organ of
                                praise. In the first part everything is plain. Apollo and the Muses
                                are to the Greek the authors of all harmony, artistic, political,
                                social, spiritual. The lyre, as the instrument of Apollo, is the
                                symbol of the reign of harmony over the wide domain of Zeus.
                                Everything that owes allegiance to Zeus obeys his son Apollo, obeys
                                the quivering of the lyre's strings. So the footstep of the dancer,
                                the voice of the singer. Even the thunderbolt, the weapon of Zeus,
                                is quenched, the bird of Zeus slumbers, the wild son of Zeus,
                                violent Ares, sleeps a deep sleep. This is the art of the son of
                                Leto and the deep-bosomed Muses (vv. 1-12).</p>
                            <p>All those that Zeus hath claimed as his own are ruled by harmony. Not
                                so those that he loves not. When they hear the sound of the
                                Pierides, they strive to flee along the solid earth and the restless
                                main. So he who now lies in dread Tartaros, enemy of the gods,
                                Typhon, reared in the famed Kilikian cave. His hairy breasts are
                                pinched by the high sea-shores of Kym&eacute; <pb n="241"/> and
                                Sicily, and Aitna's heaven-mounting column pinions him &mdash;
                                Aitna, nurse of keen snow, from whose inmost recesses belch purest
                                streams of unapproachable fire, rivers that roll sparkling smoke by
                                day, while purple flame by night bears in its whirl masses of stone
                                down to the surface of the deep, plashing. These jets of fire are
                                upflung by yon monster. Terrible are they &mdash; a marvel to
                                behold, a marvel even to hear from those that have beheld. Such a
                                creature is that which lies bound by peak and plain, while his back
                                is goaded by his craggy couch (vv. 13-28).</p>
                            <p>May we not be of those thou lovest not, may we find favor in thy
                                sight, O Zeus, lord of Aitna's mount &mdash; the forehead of
                                this fruitful land, whose namesake neighbor city the famed founder
                                glorified when the herald proclaimed her in the Pythian course by
                                reason of Hieron's noble victory with the chariot. As men who go on
                                shipboard count as the first blessing a favoring wind, an omen of a
                                happy return, so we count from this concurrence that the city will
                                henceforth be renowned for wreaths of victory and chariots, her name
                                be named mid banquet-songs. Lykian and Delian lord, thou that lovest
                                the Kastalian fount of Parnasos, make this purpose good, make the
                                land a land of men (vv. 2940).</p>
                            <p>So far Apollo and the Muses dominate &mdash; dominate as the
                                interpreters of Zeus. Now Zeus himself comes forward. Apollo is
                                mentioned no more, but the prayer to him, v. 40, is matched by a
                                prayer to the Muse in v. 58.</p>
                            <p>Zeus, Apollo, the Muses, have now led us up to the praise of Hieron.
                                The achievements of mortals are all due to the gods. Men are bards;
                                are valiant and eloquent through them (v. 41); and so, through them,
                                Hieron has the virtues of his high position, and all the so-called
                                counsels addressed to him are merely indications of what he is, or
                                thinks he is, or tries to be. In praising his hero Pindar picks out
                                first the quality that had recently distinguished him, and this
                                success was won <foreign lang="greek">qew=n pala/mais</foreign> (v.
                                48). The future lacks nothing but forgetfulness of toils and pains.
                                Greater prosperity, greater wealth, it cannot give. It can only
                                administer (<foreign lang="greek">ou(/tw</foreign>, v. 46). When the
                                forgetfulness of the bitter past comes, then the memory of all the
                                glorious achievements of war, with all its proud wealth, will
                                return. May our hero, like Philoktetes of old (v. 50), have a god to
                                be his friend and benefactor. But the song is not for Hieron alone.
                                His son, Deinomenes (v. 58), shares the joy in the victory of his
                                sire; his son is <pb n="242"/> king of the city Aitna, which Hieron
                                built for him, founding it with god-sent freedom in the laws of
                                Doric stock, after the principles of Doric harmony (v. 65). May this
                                harmony between people and princes abide, and may father pass to son
                                the keynote of concordant peace (v. 79) &mdash; peace within and
                                peace from barbaric foes without. Zeus keep the Phoenician and the
                                Tyrrhenian battle-shouts at home, now that they have seen the fell
                                destruction of their ships, the punishment of their insolence,
                                before Kym&eacute; &mdash; that weight that rests upon
                                Typhon's breast. For what Salamis to Athens, what Plataia to Sparta,
                                that to the sons of Deinomenes is the day of Himera (v. 80).</p>
                            <p>But brevity is best. Twist the strands tight. Less, then, will be the
                                blame, for surfeit dulleth the edge of expectation. Others'
                                blessings and advantages are a hateful hearing; yet envy is better
                                than pity. Hold, Hieron, to thy high career. Still guide the people
                                with a just helm. Still be thy word forged on the anvil of truth. No
                                sparkle of dross that flieth past is without its weight, coming from
                                thee. Steward of many things thou art. Faithful witnesses there are
                                many for right and wrong. Firm abide in generous temper. Wax not
                                weary in expenditure. Let thy sail belly to the wind. Let no
                                juggling gains lure thee. After mortals liveth fame alone as it
                                revealeth the lives of the departed to speakers and to singers.
                                Kroisos' generous kindliness perisheth not. The cruel soul of
                                Phalaris &mdash; brazen-bull-burner &mdash; is whelmed by
                                hating bruit; no harps beneath the roof-tree receive him to soft
                                fellowship with warbling boys. Good fortune is first; then good
                                fame. Whoso hath chanced on both and made both his own hath received
                                the highest crown (vv. 81-100).</p>
                            <p>The mood is Dorian, the rhythms dactylo-epitrite.</p>
                            <p>Of the five triads, the first two deal with harmony; the third and
                                the fourth have to do with Hieron's work as a founder, his work as a
                                warrior, with the sweet music of a concordant state, the sweet
                                silence from the barbaric cry, have to do with Aitna and Himera. The
                                last triad avoids the weariness of praise by disguising it under
                                sage counsel, with the intimation that Hieron has not only been
                                prosperous, but has gained the fair voices of the world.</p>

                            <p>This victory, gained not at the Pythian games, but at the Theban
                                Iolaia or Herakleia, is probably to be assigned to Ol. 75, 4 (477
                                B.C.), in which year Hieron had, by his interposition, saved the
                                Epizephyrian Lokrians from a bloody war with Anaxilas, tyrant of
                                Rhegion. The poem, with its dissonances, echoes the discord of the
                                times. Hieron was just then at enmity with his brother, Polyzelos,
                                who had taken refuge with his connection, Theron, the friend of
                                Pindar, and a war was impending. The strain makes itself felt amid
                                all the congratulation.</p>
                            <p>It is a strange poem, one in which divination and sympathy can
                                accomplish little. Only we must hold fast to the commonsense view
                                that Pindar did not undertake to lecture Hieron.</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Great Syracuse,&rdquo; the poet says,
                                &ldquo;rearer of men and horses, I bring this lay from Thebes in
                                honor of Hieron's victory with the four-horse chariot, gained not
                                without the favor of Artemis, goddess of Ortygia, thus wreathed with
                                glory. For Artemis and Hermes, god of games, aid Hieron when he
                                yokes his horses and calls on the God of the Trident. Other lords
                                have other minstrels, other praises. Let Kinyras be praised by
                                Kyprian voices, Kinyras beloved of Apollo, and minion of Aphrodite.
                                Thou, Hieron, beloved of Hermes and minion of Artemis, art praised
                                by the voice of the virgin of Epizephyrian Lokris, to whose eye thy
                                power hath given confidence. Grateful is she. Well hath she learned
                                the lesson of Ixion, whose punishment, as he revolves on the winged

                                sheer rebellion, typified by Typhon. Here we have another typified
                                by Ixion, base ingratitude. Typhon belonged from the beginning to
                                those <foreign lang="greek">o(/sa mh\ pefi/lhke *zeu/s</foreign>
                                    (<bibl n="Pind. P. 1">P. 1.13</bibl>). Ixion was one of those
                                who <foreign lang="greek">eu)mene/ssi pa\r *kroni/dais gluku\n
                                    ei(=lon bi/oton</foreign> (v. 25). Ixion was another, <pb
                                    n="254"/> but a worse, Tantalos. Tantalos sinned by making the
                                celestial meat and drink common (<bibl n="Pind. O. 1">O.
                                1.61</bibl>). Ixion sinned by trying to pollute the celestial bed
                                (v. 34). Each was punished in the way in which he had sinned.
                                Tantalos was reft of food and drink (note on <bibl n="Pind. O. 1"
                                    >O. 1.60</bibl>). Ixion was whirled on his own wheel, became his
                                own iynx (compare v. 40 with <bibl n="Pind. P. 4">P.
                                4.214</bibl>). Ixion's sin was of a deeper dye, and so, while the
                                son of Tantalos came to great honor (<bibl n="Pind. O. 1">O.
                                1.90</bibl>), the son of Ixion became the parent of a monstrous
                                brood.</p>
                            <p>This is the myth (vv. 25-48).</p>
                            <p>It is, indeed, not a little remarkable that in every Hieronic ode
                                there is a dark background &mdash; a Tantalos (O. 1), a Typhon
                                (P. 1), an Ixion (P. 2), a Koronis (P. 3) &mdash; and the
                                commentators are not wrong in the Fight-with-the-Dragon attitude in
                                which they have put Hieron. Who is aimed at under the figure of
                                Ixion no one can tell. The guesses and the combinations of the
                                commentators are all idle. Hieron is a manner of Zeus. He was the
                                Olympian of Sicily as Perikles was afterwards the Olympian of
                                Athens, and the doom of Tantalos, the wheel of Ixion, the crushing
                                load of Typhon, the swift destruction of Koronis, the lightning
                                death of Asklepios were in store for his enemies. The Hieronic odes
                                are Rembrandts, and we shall never know more.</p>
                            <p>Passing over to the praise of Hieron, the poet emphasizes with
                                unmistakable reduplication the power of God. &ldquo;God decides
                                the fate of hopes, God overtakes winged eagle and swift dolphin,
                                humbles the proud, to others gives glory that waxes not old (v. 52).
                                This be my lay instead of the evil tales that Archilochos told of
                                the Ixions of his time. Wealth paired with wisdom, under the
                                blessing of Fortune &mdash; this is the highest theme of
                                song&rdquo; (v. 56). The key of the poem lies in this double
                                    <foreign lang="greek">qeo/s</foreign>. God is all-powerful to
                                punish and to bless, and Hieron is his vicegerent.</p>
                            <p>The praise of Hieron follows, his wealth, his honor. His champion,
                                Pindar, denies that he has ever had his superior in Greece, and
                                boards the herald-ship all dight with flowers to proclaim his
                                achievements &mdash; now in war, now in council; now on horse,
                                and now afoot (vv. 57-66). But as we gaze, the herald-ship becomes a
                                merchant-ship (v. 67), and the song is the freight &mdash; a new
                                song, which forms the stranger afterpiece of a poem already strange
                                enough. This afterpiece is an exhortation to straightforwardness.
                                The Archilochian vein, against which Pindar protested <pb n="255"/>
                                semi-humorously before (v. 55), stands out. The ape (v. 72), the fox
                                (v. 78), the wolf (v. 84), are contrasts dramatically introduced,
                                dramatically dismissed. &ldquo;Let there be no pretentiousness,
                                no slyness, no roundabout hate. Straight-tonguedness is best in the
                                rule of the one man, of the many, of the wise. Follow God's leading,
                                bear his yoke. Kick not against the pricks. There lies the only
                                safety. May such men admit me to their friendship&rdquo; (v.
                                96).</p>
                            <p>The difficulty of the last part lies in the dramatic shiftings
                                &mdash; the same difficulty that we encounter in comedy, and
                                especially in satire. If there are not two persons, there are two
                                voices. The poet pits the <foreign lang="greek">*di/kaios
                                *lo/gos</foreign> and the <foreign lang="greek">*)/adikos
                                *lo/gos</foreign> against each other in the forum of his own
                                conscience. The <foreign lang="greek">*di/kaios *lo/gos</foreign>
                                speaks last and wins.</p>
                            <p/>
                            <p>A. Show thyself as thou art (v. 72).</p>
                            <p/>
                            <p>B. But the monkey, which is ever playing different parts, is a fair
                                creature, ever a fair creature, in the eyes of children (v. 72).</p>
                            <p/>
                            <p>A. Yes, in the eyes of children, but not in the judgment of a
                                Rhadamanthys, whose soul hath no delight in tricks (vv. 73-75).</p>
                            <p/>
                            <p>B. If the monkey finds no acceptance, what of foxy slanderers? They
                                are an evil, but an evil that cannot be mastered (vv. 76, 77).</p>
                            <p/>
                            <p>A. But what good comes of it to Mistress Vixen? (v. 78).</p>
                            <p/>
                            <p>B. &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; says Mistress Vixen, &ldquo;I swim
                                like a cork, I always fall on my feet&rdquo; (vv. 79, 80).</p>
                            <p/>
                            <p>A. But the citizen that hath the craft of a fox can have no weight in
                                the state. He is as light as his cork. He cannot utter a word of
                                power among the noble (vv. 81, 82).</p>
                            <p/>
                            <p>B. Ay, but he wheedles and worms his way through. Flattery works on
                                all (v. 82).</p>
                            <p/>
                            <p>A. I don't share the confidence of your crafty models (v. 82).</p>
                            <p/>
                            <p>B. My own creed is: Love your friends. An enemy circumvent on crooked
                                paths, like a wolf (vv. 83, 84).</p>
                            <p/>
                            <p>A. Nay, nay. No monkey, no fox, no wolf. Straight speech is best in
                                monarchy, democracy, or aristocracy. A straight course is best
                                because it is in harmony with God, and there is no contending
                                against God. Success <pb n="256"/> does not come from cunning or
                                overreaching, from envious cabals. Bear God's yoke. Kick not against
                                the pricks. Men who are good, men with views like these, such are
                                they whom I desire to live withal as friend with friend (vv. 86-96).</p>

                                    two sharp pegs. The measurer fastens one in the ground and pulls

                                    >e)pini/kia</foreign> because it celebrates the victories that
                                Hieron gained with his race-horse <foreign lang="greek"
                                >*fere/nikos</foreign> (v. 74) at Delphi, Pyth. 26 and 27 (Ol. 73,
                                3, and 74, 3, 486 and 482 B.C.). According to B&ouml;ckh, the
                                composition of the poem belongs to a much later period, Ol. 76, 3
                                (474 B.C.). Earlier than Ol. 76, 1 (476 B.C.) it cannot be, for
                                Hieron is called <foreign lang="greek">*ai)tnai=os</foreign> (v.
                                69), and Aitna was founded in that year. Later than Ol. 76, 3 it
                                cannot well be, for in that year Hieron won a chariot-race at
                                Delphi, of which no mention is made in this poem. B&ouml;ckh
                                thinks that the ode was composed shortly before P. 1, probably to
                                celebrate the recurrent date of the previous victories. Hieron was
                                suffering (compare <bibl n="Pind. P. 1">P. 1.50</bibl>), and
                                hence the blending of congratulation and consolation. The
                                &ldquo;historical&rdquo; allusions to scandals in Hieron's
                                family and to the quarrels of the court physicians are all due to
                                the fancy of the commentators.</p>
                            <p>The drift of P. 3 seems to be plain enough. Hieron is victorious, but
                                suffering, and he must learn that the gods give two pains for one
                                pleasure, and be content to have only one against one. To expect
                                more is to reach out to what is not and cannot be. To this lesson
                                the poet leads up step by step. So in the very beginning of this ode
                                he himself sets an example of the impatient yearning he condemns.
                                &ldquo;Would that the old Centaur, the master of Asklepios, the
                                great healer, were alive!&rdquo; A poet, Pindar longs for the
                                control of leechcraft, and does not recognize his own ambition until
                                other examples of disappointment pass before his eyes. Such an
                                example is Koronis, mother of Asklepios. This was her sin: she had
                                one love, she wanted yet another (v. 25). Asklepios himself comes
                                next. He was a leech of wide renown &mdash; a benefactor to his
                                kind &mdash; but he was a slave to gain (v. 54). This was his
                                sin, and, like his mother, he perished <pb n="269"/> (v. 57). And
                                now the poet draws the moral. &ldquo;Mortals must seek what is
                                meet for mortals, and recognize where they stand, what is their
                                fate.&rdquo; The wish is renewed, but this time with a sigh. The
                                poet is not satisfied with paying Hieron his homage in music, he
                                yearns to bring him the master of healing and gain a double share of
                                favor. It must not be; he cannot cross the water with this double
                                joy (v. 72). He must be content to stay at home and make vows to the
                                goddess at his door (v. 77). This lesson Hieron and Hieron's poet
                                must divide: <foreign lang="greek">e(\n par' e)slo\n ph/mata su/nduo
                                    dai/ontai brotoi=s</foreign> &verbar; <foreign lang="greek"
                                    >a)qa/natoi</foreign> (v. 81). That is the rule. Make the best
                                of it. Look at Peleus. Look at Kadmos (vv. 87, 88). They heard the
                                Muses, as Hieron heard Pindar's songs. One married Harmonia, one
                                Thetis (vv. 91, 92). Both saw the sons of Kronos banqueting with
                                them, both received bridal gifts of the gods. But three daughters
                                brought threefold sorrow to Kadmos. True, one daughter's couch was
                                shared by Zeus (v. 99), yet this is only one joy to three sorrows.
                                Against the bridal of Thetis set the death of Achilles (v. 100), an
                                only son, and so more than a double sorrow. &ldquo;Enjoy, then,
                                what thou mayest while thou mayest in the changing breezes of
                                fortune, in the ticklish balance of prosperity. This be our creed.
                                Fit thy will to God's will. Pray for wealth. Hope for fame. Fame
                                rests on song. Nestor and Sarpedon &mdash; the one who lost his
                                noble son, the other lost to a divine sire &mdash; live on in
                                lays. Few achieve this&rdquo; (vv. 102115). And so the poem ends
                                with the tacit pledge that Hieron shall live on in P.'s song as they
                                in Homer's.</p>
                            <p>The rhythms are dactylo-epitrite (Dorian).</p>
                            <p>The distribution of the elements is different from that of an
                                ordinary <foreign lang="greek">e)pini/kion</foreign>. The myth, with
                                a slight introduction, takes up nearly half the poem. Indeed, the
                                whole ode is a picturegallery of mythic troubles. We have at full
                                length Koronis and Asklepios, who were guilty; with less detail
                                Kadmos and Peleus, who were innocent; and, in mere outline, Nestor
                                and Sarpedon &mdash; Nestor, who was lord among the third
                                generation but to see Antilochos die; Sarpedon, who was mourned by
                                Zeus himself. But all this sorrow is lost in the light of poetry.</p>

                                    Sarpedon balances (Pylian) Nestor. One shining light is taken
                                    out of each camp. Sarpedon, we are reminded, was the grandson of
                                    Bellerophon, B. was from Corinth, and Corinth was the metropolis
                                    of Syracuse. But P. is thinking of Homer and the looming figures
                                    of Nestor on the Greek, Sarpedon on the Trojan side. Some quiet

                                son of Battos IV., king of Kyrene, won a Pythian victory with the
                                chariot, <bibl n="Pind. P. 3">P. 3.1</bibl> (Ol. 78, 3 = 466
                                B.C.). This victory is commemorated in the fourth and fifth Pythian
                                odes. P. 5 was composed to celebrate the return of the victorious
                                    <foreign lang="greek">pomph/</foreign>, which took place, as has
                                been conjectured, at the time of the <foreign lang="greek"
                                >*ka/rneia</foreign>, a festival which fell about the same time as
                                the Pythian. The fourth ode was doubtless composed to be sung at a
                                banquet in the royal palace, and seems to have been prepared at the
                                urgent request of one Damophilos, who had been exiled by Arkesilas
                                for participating in an aristocratic rebellion. That he was related
                                to Arkesilas, that he was akin to Pindar, is little more than
                                conjecture. &ldquo;Urgent request&rdquo; means in Pindar's
                                case a lordly recompense. The poem was a grand peace-offering, and
                                the reconciliation had doubtless been quietly arranged in advance.</p>
                            <p>Not only in size, but also in many other respects, the fourth Pythian
                                is Pindar's greatest poem &mdash; a prime favorite with all
                                Pindaric scholars. The obscurities are few in proportion to the
                                bulk, the diction is noble and brilliant. The aesthetic value is
                                great, for in this poem we have a whole incorporated theory of the
                                lyric treatment of epic themes, the Argonautic expedition in points
                                of light.</p>
                            <p>After a brief invocation of the Muse, Pindar tells how the priestess
                                of Apollo bade Battos leave his sacred island, Thera, and found a
                                city on a shimmering hill in Libya, and thus bring to honor the
                                prophecy of Medeia (vv. 1-9).</p>
                            <p>In the Prophecy of Medeia, we learn the story of the wonderful clod
                                that a deity delivered to the Argonaut Euphamos where the Libyan
                                lake Tritonis empties into the sea. Washed overboard, this symbol of
                                sovereignty followed the wet main to <pb n="279"/> Thera, whence the
                                descendants of Euphamos should, at the bidding of Apollo, go forth
                                and possess the land promised to their ancestor (vv. 10-56).</p>
                            <p>Such is the prophecy that was fulfilled by Battos, the founder of
                                Kyrene, and it is to the descendant of this Battos in the eighth
                                generation that Apollo has given the glory of the victory in the
                                chariot-race, the theme of Pindar's song (vv. 57-69).</p>
                            <p>So far the overture. Then follows the Quest of the Golden Fleece, or
                                the Voyage of the Argonauts, which constitutes the bulk of the poem
                                (vv. 70-256).</p>
                            <p>On their return voyage the Argonauts had shared the couches of
                                Lemnian heroines. From such a union came the stock of Euphamos,
                                which went first to Lakedaimon, thence to Thera, and from Thera to
                                Kyrene (v. 261).</p>
                            <p>Here the poem seems to pause. A stop at <foreign lang="greek"
                                    >*kura/nas</foreign> (v. 261) would satisfy mind and ear. But P.
                                continues with an afterthought participle, which emphasizes the
                                importance of right counsel, and prepares the message that he has to
                                deliver. The message is one that needs delicate handling, and, like
                                the wise woman of Tekoah, P. clothes it in a parable &mdash; the
                                Apologue of the Lopped Oak (vv. 263-268).</p>
                            <p>The answer is not given at once. The king is a healer that knows well
                                the art of the soothing hand. The king is one that, under the
                                guidance of God, can put the shaken city on its true foundation. He
                                has only to will and it is done. Let him then take counsel, and
                                consider what Homer said, that a fair messenger makes fair tidings.
                                Such a fair messenger is the poet's Muse (vv. 270-279).</p>
                            <p>The way being thus prepared, the name of Damophilos is mentioned for
                                the first time, and the praise of the banished nobleman is blended
                                with an appeal for such forgiveness as Zeus accorded the Titans.
                                &ldquo;Let him see his home again; let him take his delight in
                                banquets by Apollo's fountain. Let him make melody on the harp. Let
                                his days be days of quietness, himself all harmless, by the world
                                unharmed. Then he can tell what a wellspring of song he found for
                                Arkesilas at Thebes&rdquo; (vv. 281-299).</p>
                            <p>As the fourth Pythian is thrown out of line with the other odes by
                                its size, and as this characteristic determines the handling of the
                                poem, the distribution of the masses becomes a matter of leading
                                importance and cannot be relegated, as has been <pb n="280"/> done
                                elsewhere, to a mere summary. Pindar nowhere else goes beyond five
                                triads. Here he has the relatively vast structure of thirteen. If
                                the introduction bore any proportion to the myth, or to the
                                introductions of the other poems, we should have a large porch of
                                song. What do we find? The poet seems to enter upon the theme at
                                once, as if he were composing an epic and not a lyric. The ringing
                                relative that so often introduces the myth makes itself heard almost
                                immediately after the invocation of the Muse (v. 4). We slip out of
                                port in a moment, and find ourselves in the midst of the returning
                                Argonauts. But the introduction is longer than it seems. The first
                                three triads constitute an introductory epyllion &mdash; the
                                Prophecy of Medeia &mdash; which bears a just proportion to the
                                rest. Only if the usual measure were observed the myth would occupy
                                seven triads and the conclusion three (3+7+3), but the story runs
                                over into the eleventh triad, when the poet chides himself as having
                                lingered too long (v. 247), and the slow imperfects give way to the
                                rapid aorists. He calls on Arkesilas (v. 250) in order to show that
                                he is hasting to Kyrene, and the emphasis laid on the guidance of
                                Apollo prepares the conclusion. Notice that the story of the
                                Argonauts makes the same returning sweep to Arkesilas and Apollo as
                                the Prophecy of Medeia (vv. 65, 66). Apollo is an oracular god, and
                                speaks in riddles. &ldquo;So read me,&rdquo; the poet says,
                                &ldquo;the riddle of Oidipus&rdquo; (v. 263). After this
                                riddle is given, &ldquo;fulfil the word of Homer&rdquo; (v.
                                277). Both Oidipus and Homer, be it noted, are Apollinic. The answer
                                to the riddle is &mdash; Damophilos (v. 281); but it is not
                                until the poet has claimed the good messenger's credit, according to
                                the word of Homer, that he brings forth the name. The poem closes
                                with a commendation of the banished nobleman, and with the evident
                                intimation that this song was made at his desire (v. 299).</p>
                            <p>The myth itself (vv. 70-256) is natural enough. It is natural enough
                                that in celebrating the victory of Arkesilas, Pindar should sing of
                                the founding of Kyrene; and the introduction of the Argonautic
                                expedition may be justified on general grounds; but this is not the
                                only time that Pindar has sung Kyrene. In P. 5 Battos and the
                                Aigeidai come to honor, in P. 9, the heroine Kyrene, but there is no
                                such overwhelming excess of the myth. In the length of the myth
                                nothing more is to be seen than the costliness of the offering. If
                                the poem was to be long, the myth must needs be long. <pb n="281"/></p>
                            <p>There are those who see in Pindar's Argonautic expedition a parable.
                                Damophilos is Iason. Then Arkesilas must be Pelias &mdash; which
                                is incredible. Damophilos is anybody else, anything else. Sooner the
                                soul of Phrixos (v. 159), sooner the mystic clod that Euphamos
                                received (v. 21). The tarrying of the soul of Phrixos, the drifting
                                of the clod, the long voyage of the Argonauts, may be symbolical of
                                the banishment of Damophilos. He could not rest save in Kyrene (v.
                                294). The true keynote, then, is the sweetness of return, the
                                sweetness of the fulfilment of prophecy and of the fruition of hope
                                long deferred. The ancient prophecy came to pass, and Battos founded
                                Kyrene (vv. 6, 260). The word of Medeia was brought to honor in the
                                seventeenth generation (v. 10). The ships should one day be
                                exchanged for chariots (v. 18). The clod, following the watery main,
                                was borne to Thera, not to Tainaros (v. 42), and yet the pledge
                                failed not. Iason came back to his native land (v. 78). Everybody
                                comes back, not Iason alone, else the moral were too pointed. Let
                                Damophilos come back. Let there be one Kyrenaian more.</p>
                            <p>The measures are dactylo-epitrite (Dorian), and the grave, oracular

                            <p>&ldquo;As this poem, among all the Pindaric odes, approaches the
                                epos most closely, so the rhythmical composition reminds one of the
                                simplicity of an hexametrical hymn. Four times in succession we have
                                precisely the same pentapody, <quote>

                                </quote> the close of which reminds us of the hexameter, which, like
                                it, prefers the trisyllabic bar towards the close. Another example
                                of this will be sought in vain throughout Pindar. These five
                                pentapodies are followed by nine tetrapodies, interrupted only by a
                                dipody in the middle of the strophe, where there is usually most
                                movement&rdquo; (J. H. H. Schmidt).</p>

                                    nobility and the branches the members. But nothing seems clearer
                                    than that the oak is one. Who is the oak? Iason. But as Iason
                                        <pb n="302"/> would be the type of Damophilos, Arkesilas
                                    would be Pelias, which is monstrous. Are all these accessories

                                    insurrection and the master's house the Persian
                                    Empire?&rdquo; Is this an Homeric comparison, or a Pindaric
                                    riddle? Why should not the &lsquo;wisdom of
                                    Oidipus&rsquo; refer to the case of Oidipus himself? Oidipus
                                    is uttering a parable for the benefit of those to whom he had
                                    come as an exile. The parallel between the exiled Oidipus and
                                    the exiled Damophilos is one that would not insult Arkesilas,
                                    and the coincidences in detail between the oak and Oidipus are

                            <p>The fifth Pythian celebrates the same victory as the fourth (Pyth.
                                31, Ol. 78, 3=466 B.C.), and was sung in the festal procession along
                                the street of Apollo at Kyrene. The charioteer, who plays a
                                conspicuous part in the ode, was Karrhotos (Alexibiades), brother of
                                the king's wife.</p>
                            <p>For the legendary portion of the story of the Battiadai, Pindar
                                himself, in these two odes, is our chief authority. Herodotos has
                                given much space in his fourth book (c. 150, foll.) to the early
                                history of the house.</p>
                            <p>The founder of Kyrene was Aristoteles, surnamed Battos, descendant of
                                Euphemos, the Minyan, of Tainaros. From Tainaros the family went to
                                Thera, and in the seventeenth generation fulfilled an ancient oracle
                                by the occupation of Kyrene, which had been settled five hundred
                                years before by the Trojan Antenoridai. Kyrene was founded Ol. 37
                                (632 B.C.), and the throne was filled by eight kings in succession,
                                an Arkesilas succeeding a Battos to the end. The rule of the
                                Battiadai seems to have been harsh; revolts were frequent; and the
                                Arkesilas of this poem was the last of the kings, and fell in a
                                popular tumult.</p>
                            <p>This ode seems to be the one ordered by the king; the preceding ode
                                was a propitiatory present from a banished nobleman, Damophilos.</p>
                            <p>In the fifth Pythian the theme is stated in the very beginning.
                                Wealth wedded to Honor and blessed by Fortune hath a wide sway (v.
                                1, foll.). The word <foreign lang="greek">o)/lbos</foreign> is
                                repeated with a marked persistency. So we read v. 14: <foreign
                                    lang="greek">polu\s o)/lbos a)mfine/metai</foreign>, v. 55:

                                (v. 94). But Honor is not less loved. We have <foreign lang="greek"
                                    >su\n eu)doci/a|</foreign> (v. 8), <foreign lang="greek"

                                    >mega/lan a)reta/n</foreign> (v. 98). There is a <foreign

                                <foreign lang="greek">o)/mma faenno/taton</foreign> (v. 56). But
                                above Wealth and Honor is the blessing of God. The power is given of
                                God (v. 13). The glory must be ascribed to God (v. 25). The men who
                                came to Thera came not without the gods (v. 76). God makes of
                                potency performance (v. 117). The higher powers aid at every turn
                                &mdash; Kastor of the golden chariot (v. 9); Apollo, god of the
                                festal lay (v. 23); Apollo, leader of the colony (v. 60); and, to
                                crown all, Zeus himself (v. 122). This iteration makes the dominant
                                thought plain enough, and there seems to be no propriety in classing
                                the poem &ldquo;among the most difficult of the Pindaric
                                odes.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>After an introduction, then, which has for its theme the power of
                                prosperity paired with honor under the blessing of Fortune, as
                                illustrated by Arkesilas' possession of ancestral dignity and his
                                attainment of the Pythian prize (vv. 1-22), the poet is about to
                                pass to the story of Battos, founder of Kyrene, in whose career are
                                prefigured the fortunes of his race. But Pindar pauses perforce to
                                pay a tribute to Karrhotos, the charioteer, before he tells the
                                legend of Battos, just as in O. 8 he pauses perforce after the
                                legend of Aiakos to praise Melesias, the trainer. Such details were
                                doubtless nominated in the bond. This time the honor is paid to one
                                who stands near the king, and it needs no apology. The trainer has
                                but one sixth of O. 8, the charioteer has one fourth of P. 5. The
                                transition is managed here with much greater art than in O. 8, which
                                shows the jar of the times. Karrhotos represents the new blessing of
                                the Pythian victory as Battos represents the old blessing of
                                Apollo's leadership.</p>
                            <p>The story of Battos is briefly told, as is the story of Aiakos in O.
                                8. True, he put lions to flight (v. 58), but it was Apollo's doing,
                                and Battos is as faint in the light of Apollo as Aiakos in the light
                                of his divine partners. He was fortunate while he lived, and honored
                                after his death (vv. 94, 95), but we are not allowed to forget the
                                thought of the opening, v. 25: <foreign lang="greek">panti\ me\n
                                    qeo\n ai)/tion u(pertiqe/men</foreign>, a thought which is
                                reinforced by the close also.</p>
                            <p>The rhythms are logaoedic in the main, but the strophe has a long

                                and was celebrated by Simonides also, acc. to the Schol. on I. 2.
                                The victor, Xenokrates, was an Agrigentine, brother of Theron.

                                ode was sung at a banquet held at Delphi in honor of Thrasybulos.</p>
                            <p>The theme is the glory of filial devotion. As the man that hath dared
                                and died for his father's life, so the man that hath wrought and
                                spent for his father's honor hath a treasure of hymns that nothing
                                shall destroy, laid up where neither rain nor wind doth corrupt.</p>
                            <p>The simplicity of the thought is not matched by the language, which
                                is a trifle overwrought.</p>
                            <p>The poet's ploughshare is turning up a field of Aphrodite or the
                                Charites as he draws nigh to the temple centre of the earth where
                                lies a treasure for the Emmenidai, for Akragas, for Xenokrates (vv.
                                1-9).</p>
                            <p>A treasure which neither the fierce armament of wintry rain nor storm
                                with its rout of rubble shall bear to the recesses of the sea
                                &mdash; a treasure whose face, shining in clear light, shall
                                announce a victory common to thy father, Thrasybulos, and to thy
                                race, and glorious in the repute of mortals (vv. 10-18).</p>
                            <p>At thy right hand, upheld by thee, rideth the Law, once given in the
                                mountains by the son of Philyra to Peleides when sundered from
                                father and mother, first of all to reverence the Thunderer, then of
                                such reverence never to deprive his parents in their allotted life
                                (vv. 19-27).</p>
                            <p>There was another, Antilochos, man of might, that aforetime showed
                                this spirit by dying for his father in his stand against Memnon.
                                Nestor's chariot was tangled by his horse, stricken <pb n="316"/> of
                                Paris' arrows, and Memnon plied his mighty spear. His soul awhirl
                                the old man of Messene called: My son! (vv. 28-36).</p>
                            <p>Not to the ground fell his word. Stedfast the god-like man awaited
                                the foe, bought with his life the rescue of his father, for his high
                                deed loftiest example of the olden time to younger men, pattern of
                                filial worth. These things are of the past. Of the time that now is
                                Thrasybulos hath come nearest to the mark in duty to a father (vv.
                                37-45).</p>
                            <p>His father's brother he approaches in all manner of splendor. With
                                wisdom he guides his wealth. The fruit of his youth is not injustice
                                nor violence, but the pursuit of poesy in the haunts of the
                                Pierides, and to thee, Poseidon, with thy passionate love of steeds,
                                he clings, for with thee hath he found favor. Sweet also is the
                                temper of his soul, and as a boon companion he outvies the
                                cell&egrave; labor of the bees (vv. 46-54).</p>
                            <p>The poem is the second in time of Pindar's odes. Eight years separate
                                it from P. 10, and Leop. Schmidt notices a decided advance, although
                                he sees in it many traces of youthfulness. The parallel between
                                Antilochos, son of Nestor, who died for his father, and Thrasybulos,
                                son of Xenokrates, who drove for his, has evoked much criticism,
                                and, while the danger of the chariot-race must not be overlooked,
                                the step from Antilochos to Thrasybulos is too great for sober art.</p>
                            <p>The poem consists of six strophes, with slight overlapping once,
                                where, however, the sense of the preceding strophe (v. 45) is
                                complete, and the participle comes in as an after-thought (compare
                                    <bibl n="Pind. P. 4">P. 4.262</bibl>). Of these six strophes
                                two describe the treasure, two tell the story of Antilochos, son of
                                Nestor, prototype of filial self-sacrifice, the last two do honor to
                                the victor's son.</p>
                            <p>The rhythm is logaoedic.</p>

                                Megakles, whose victory is here celebrated, was a member of the
                                aristocratic house of the Alkmaionidai, a grandson of that Megakles
                                who married the daughter of Kleisthenes, tyrant of Sikyon (<bibl
                                    n="Hdt. 6.127">Hdt. 6, 127 foll.</bibl>). Whether our Megakles
                                was the son of Kleisthenes, the lawgiver, or of Hippokrates, brother
                                of the lawgiver, does not appear. The latter is called simply
                                    <foreign lang="greek">suggenh/s</foreign> by the Scholiast. The
                                victory was gained Pyth. 25 (Ol. 72, 3), the year of the battle of
                                Marathon. Whether the Pythian games were celebrated and the ode
                                composed before the battle or not is a question that has led to
                                elaborate discussion, which cannot be presented here even in
                                summary. Pindar's patriotism, so dear to many, so doubtful to some,
                                is thought to be at stake; but we have to do with Pindar the poet,
                                rather than Pindar the patriot; and all that can be said in this
                                place is, that even if the ode was composed and performed after the
                                battle, there were reasons enough why the poet should not have
                                referred distinctly to a victory, the greatness of which was not
                                necessary to make Athens great enough for poetry; a victory which
                                would not have been a pleasant theme for the Alkmaionidai, on
                                account of the suspicions of treachery that attached to them (<bibl
                                    n="Hdt. 6.115">Hdt. 6, 115</bibl>).</p>
                            <p>Athens is the fairest preface of song, the fairest foundation of a
                                monument of praise to the Alkmaionidai for their victory in the
                                chariot-race. No fatherland, no house, whose name is greater praise
                                throughout Greece (vv. 1-6).</p>
                            <p>The story of the Erechtheidai haunts every city, for they made the
                                temple of Apollo in divine Pytho a marvel to behold. That were
                                enough, but I am led to further song by five Isthmian victories, one
                                o'ertopping victory at Olympia, and two from Pytho (vv. 7-12). <pb
                                    n="322"/></p>
                            <p>These have been won by you that now are and by your forefathers. My
                                heart is full of joy at this new good-fortune. What though noble
                                acts have for their requital envy? Abiding happiness brings with it
                                now this, now that (vv. 13-17).</p>
                            <p>Mezger sees in this ode a complete poem, not a fragment, as L.
                                Schmidt does. No part of an <foreign lang="xgreek"
                                >epinikion</foreign>, he says, is wanting. Praises of the victor,
                                the victory, the family, the city, the god of the games, form the
                                usual garland. In the heart of the poem stands the great act of
                                piety, the building of the Delphic temple. The victories of the
                                Alkmaionidai are a reward of their service to Apollo. The citizens
                                are not all so grateful as the god, but their envy is only an
                                assurance of abiding happiness.</p>
                            <p>So short a poem does not call for an elaborate analysis. Chiefly
                                noteworthy is the way in which each member of the triad balances
                                itself. The strophe has to do with Athens and the Alkmaionidai, the
                                antistrophe with splendid generosity and brilliant success, the
                                epode sums up new and old, and sets off abiding happiness against
                                the envy which it costs. Compare the structure of O. 12.</p>

                            <p>Aristomenes of Aigina, the son of Xenarkes, belonged to the clan of
                                the Midylidai, and had good examples to follow in his own family.
                                One of his uncles, Theognetos, was victorious at Olympia, another,
                                Kleitomachos, at the Isthmian games, both in wrestling, for which
                                Aristomenes was to be distinguished. His victories at Megara, at
                                Marathon, in Aigina, were crowned by success at the Pythian games.
                                It is tolerably evident that at the time of this ode he was passing
                                from the ranks of the boywrestlers (v. 78). No mention is made of
                                the trainer, a character who occupies so much space in O. 8.</p>
                            <p>P. was, in all likelihood, present at the games (v. 59). The poem
                                seems to have been composed for the celebration in Aigina
                                &mdash; compare <foreign lang="greek">to/qi</foreign> (v. 64),
                                which points to distant Delphi, and note that Hesychia, and not
                                Apollo, is invoked at the outset of the ode.</p>
                            <p>What is the date? According to the Schol., Pyth. 35 (Ol. 82, 3 = 450
                                B.C.), when Aigina had been six years under the yoke of Athens; but
                                the supposed reference to foreign wars (v. 3), and the concluding
                                verses, which imply the freedom of the island, led O.
                                M&uuml;ller and many others to give an earlier date to the
                                victory, 458 B.C. Allusions to the battle of Kekryphaleia (<bibl
                                    n="Thuc. 1.105">Thuk. 1, 105</bibl>) were also detected, but
                                Kekryphaleia was a bad day for the Aiginetans, because the Athenian
                                success was the forerunner of Aiginetan ruin (Diod. 11, 78), and a
                                reference to it would have been incomprehensible. In any case, P.
                                would hardly have represented the Athenians as the monstrous brood
                                of giants (v. 12 foll.). Mezger, who adheres to the traditional
                                date, sees in <foreign lang="greek">pole/mwn</foreign> (v. 3) an
                                allusion, not to foreign wars, but to domestic factions, such as
                                naturally ensued when the Athenians changed the Aiginetan
                                constitution to the detriment of the nobles (<foreign lang="greek"
                                    >oi( paxei=s</foreign>). Kr&uuml;ger gives the earlier date
                                of Ol. 77, 3 (470 B.C.). or Ol. 78, 3 (466 B.C.). Hermann goes back
                                as far as Ol. 75, 3 (478 B.C.), and sees in the ode allusions to the
                                Persian war, Porphyrion <pb n="325"/> and Typh&otilde;eus being
                                prefigurements of Xerxes &mdash; altogether unlikely. Fennell,
                                who advocates 462 B.C., suggests the great victory of Eurymedon four
                                years before &ldquo;as having revived the memory of Salamis,
                                while apprehensions of Athenian aggression were roused by the recent
                                reduction of Thasos.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>If we accept the late date, the poem becomes of special importance as
                                Pindar's last, just as P. 10 is of special importance as Pindar's
                                earliest ode. Leopold Schmidt has made the most of the tokens of
                                declining power. Mezger, on the other hand, emphasizes the
                                steadiness of the technical execution, and the similarity of the
                                tone. &ldquo;In <bibl n="Pind. P. 10">P. 10.20</bibl> we have

                                of commonplaces proves nothing. There is undoubtedly an accent of
                                experience added in P. 8; and, according to Mezger's own
                                interpretation, <bibl n="Pind. P. 8">P. 8.71</bibl> is deeper
                                than <bibl n="Pind. P. 10">P. 10.20</bibl>. Jean Paul says
                                somewhere, &ldquo;The youngest heart has the waves of the
                                oldest; it only lacks the plummet that measures their
                                depth.&rdquo; In P. 8 Pindar has the plummet.</p>
                            <p>Hesychia is to Aigina what the lyre is to Syracuse; and the eighth
                                Pythian, which begins with the invocation <foreign lang="greek"
                                    >*filo/fron *(hsuxi/a</foreign>, is not unrelated to the first
                                Pythian, which begins with the invocation <foreign lang="greek"
                                    >*xruse/a fo/rmigc</foreign>. In the one, the lyre is the symbol
                                of the harmony produced by the splendid sway of a central power,
                                Hieron; in the other, the goddess Hesychia diffuses her influence
                                through all the members of the commonwealth. In the one case, the
                                balance is maintained by a strong hand; in the other, it depends on
                                the nice adjustment of forces within the state. Typh&otilde;eus
                                figures here (v. 16) as he figures in the first Pythian; but there
                                the monster stretches from Cumae to Sicily, and represents the shock
                                of foreign warfare as well as the volcanic powers of revolt (note on
                                    <bibl n="Pind. P. 1">P. 1.72</bibl>); here there is barely a
                                hint, if a hint, of trouble from without. Here, too,
                                Typh&otilde;eus is quelled by Zeus, and Porphyrion, king of the
                                giants, by Apollo (vv. 1618); but we have no Aitna keeping down the
                                monster, and a certain significance attaches to <foreign
                                    lang="greek">e)n xro/nw|</foreign> of v. 15.</p>
                            <p>The opening, then, is a tribute to Hesychia, the goddess of domestic
                                tranquillity, who holds the keys of wars and councils, <pb n="326"/>
                                who knows the secret of true gentleness (vv. 1-7), who has strength
                                to sink the rebellious crew of malcontents, such as Porphyrion and
                                Typh&otilde;eus &mdash; the one quelled by the thunderbolt
                                of Zeus, the other by the bow of Apollo &mdash; Apollo, who
                                welcomed the son of Xenarkes home from Kirrha, crowned with
                                Parnassian verdure and Dorian revel-song (vv. 8-20).</p>
                            <p>Then begins the praise of Aigina for her exploits in the games, and
                                the praise of Aristomenes for keeping up the glory of his house and
                                for exalting the clan of the Midylidai and earning the word that
                                Amphiaraos spoke (vv. 21-40).</p>
                            <p>The short myth follows, the scene in which the soul of Amphiaraos,
                                beholding the valor of his son and his son's comrades among the
                                Epigonoi, uttered the words: <foreign lang="greek">*fua=| to\
                                    gennai=on e)pipre/pei</foreign> &verbar; <foreign
                                    lang="greek">e)k pate/rwn paisi\n lh=ma</foreign> (v. 44). The
                                young heroes have the spirit of their sires. &ldquo;Blood will
                                tell.&rdquo; Adrastos, leader of the first adventure, is
                                compassed by better omens now; true, he alone will lose his son, but
                                he will bring back his people safe by the blessing of the gods (vv.
                                41-55).</p>
                            <p>O. 8, another Aiginetan ode, is prayerful. Prayer and oracle are
                                signs of suspense; and the utterance of Amphiaraos carries with it
                                the lesson that Aigina's only hope lay in the preservation of the
                                spirit of her nobility. What the figure of Adrastos means is not so
                                evident. It may signify: Whatever else perishes, may the state abide
                                unharmed.</p>
                            <p>Such, then, were the words of Amphiaraos, whose praise of his son
                                Alkmaion is echoed by Pindar &mdash; for Alkmaion is not only
                                the prototype of Aristomenes, but he is also the neighbor of the
                                poet, guardian of his treasures, and spoke to him in oracles (vv.
                                56-60).</p>
                            <p>Similar sudden shifts are common in the quicker rhythms (Aiolian),
                                and the Aiginetan odes of P. presume an intimacy that we cannot
                                follow in detail.</p>
                            <p>P. now turns with thanksgiving and prayer to Apollo &mdash;
                                entreats his guidance, craves for the fortunes of the house of
                                Xenarkes the boon of a right reverence of the gods. Success is not
                                the test of merit. It is due to the will of Fortune, who makes men
                                her playthings. &ldquo;Therefore keep thee within
                                bounds.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>Then follows the recital of the victories, with a vivid picture of
                                the defeated contestants as they slink homeward (vv. 61-87).</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;The bliss of glory lends wings and lifts the soul above
                                riches. But delight waxeth in a little space. It falls to the
                                ground, when shaken by adversity. We are creatures of a day. What
                                are we? <pb n="327"/> what are we not? A dream of shadow is man. Yet
                                all is not shadow. When God-given splendor comes there is a clear
                                shining and a life of sweetness.&rdquo;</p>
                            <p>&ldquo;Aigina, mother dear, bring this city safely onward in her
                                course of freedom, with the blessing of Zeus, Lord Aiakos, Peleus,
                                and good Telamon and Achilles&rdquo; (vv. 88-100).</p>
                            <p>Compare again the close of O. 8. This invocation of all the saints in
                                the calendar is ominous.</p>
                            <p>To sum up: The first triad is occupied with the praise of Hesychia,
                                ending in praise of the victor. The second triad begins with the
                                praise of Aigina, and ends with the Midylidai, to whom the victor
                                belongs. The third triad gives the story of Alkmaion, as an
                                illustration of the persistency of noble blood. The fourth
                                acknowledges the goodness of Apollo, and entreats his further
                                guidance; for God is the sole source of these victories, which are
                                now recounted. The fifth presents a striking contrast between
                                vanquished and victor, and closes with an equally striking contrast
                                between the nothingness of man and the power of God, which can make
                                even the shadow of a dream to be full of light and glory. At the end
                                is heard a fervent prayer for Aigina's welfare.</p>
                            <p>So we have two for introduction, one for myth, two for conclusion. It
                                is evident that the circumstances are too absorbing for the free
                                development of the mythic portion. We have here a tremulous poem
                                with a melancholy note in the midst of joyousness.</p>
                            <p>The lesson, if there must be a lesson, is: In quietness and
                                confidence shall be your strength. The only hope of Aigina, as was
                                said above, is the persistence of the type of her nobility, but it
                                is clear that it is hoping against hope.</p>
                            <p>The rhythms are Aiolian (logaoedic). The restlessness, in spite of
                                Hesychia, forms a marked contrast to the majestic balance of P. 1.</p>

                            <p>The ninth Pythian was composed in honor of Telesikrates of Kyrene,
                                son of Karneiades, who was successful as an <foreign lang="greek"
                                    >o(plitoo\ro/mos</foreign>, Pyth. 28 (Ol. 75, 3 = 478 B.C.).
                                Telesikrates had previously distinguished himself at all the local
                                games of Kyrene, had been victorious in Aigina, at Megara, and,
                                after the race in armor, gained a foot-race at Delphi, Pyth. 30 (Ol.
                                77, 3 = 470 B.C.). P. tells of the former victory only, and the poem
                                must have been composed at the earlier date. B&ouml;ckh thinks
                                that Telesikrates had not returned to Kyrene when the poem was sung;
                                nor, on the other hand, is there any trace of a <foreign
                                    lang="greek">kw=mos</foreign> at Delphi. Hence the inference
                                that the performance was at Thebes. Unfortunately <foreign
                                    lang="greek">de/cetai</foreign> (v. 79) proves nothing more than
                                that the ode was not composed at Kyrene. Otfried M&uuml;ller
                                conjectures that Telesikrates belonged to the Aigeidai, and we have
                                good reason to believe that Pindar was an Aigeid (<bibl
                                    n="Pind. P. 5">P. 5.76</bibl>). The name Karneiades points to
                                the Karneia, a traditional festival among the Aigeidai.</p>
                            <p>The acknowledged difficulty of the poem will justify a detailed
                                abstract.</p>
                            <p>I sing Telesikrates, crowning glory of Kyrene, whom Apollo brought on
                                golden chariot from windy Pelion, and made the huntress-maiden queen
                                of a fruitful continent (vv. 1-9). Silverfoot Aphrodite received the
                                Delian guest and shed winsome shamefastness on the bridal couch of
                                Apollo and the daughter of Hypseus, king of the Lapithai, to whom a
                                Naiad bore her (vv. 10-18). Naught did this white-armed maiden reck
                                of loom or dance or home-keeping with her playmates. With dart and
                                falchion slew she the fierce beasts of prey and gave rest to her
                                father's kine, scant slumber granting to eyelids on which sleep
                                loves to press towards dawn (vv. 19-27).</p>
                            <p>He found her &mdash; he, God of the Wide Quiver &mdash; as
                                she was <pb n="336"/> struggling alone, unarmed, with a furious
                                lion. Out he called Cheiron from his cave to mark the woman's
                                spirit, and to tell her parentage (vv. 28-36). Whate'er her lineage,
                                the struggle shows boundless courage. &ldquo;Is it
                                right,&rdquo; asks the god, &ldquo;to lay hand on her and
                                pluck the sweet flower of love?&rdquo; The Centaur smiled and
                                answered: &ldquo;Secret are the keys of Suasion that unlock the
                                sanctuary of love's delights; gods and men alike shun open
                                union&rdquo; (vv. 37-45). Thou didst but dissemble, thou who
                                knowest everything, both end and way, the number of the leaves of
                                spring, the number of the sands in sea and rivers, that which is to
                                be and whence it is to come. But if I must measure myself with the
                                Wise One &mdash; (vv. 46-54).</p>
                            <p>I will speak. Thou didst come to be wedded lord to her, and to bear
                                her over sea to the garden of Zeus, where thou wilt make her queen
                                of a city when thou shalt have gathered the islandfolk about the
                                plain-compassed hill. Now Queen Libya shall receive her as a bride
                                in golden palaces, lady of a land not tributeless of fruits nor
                                ignorant of chase (vv. 55-62). There shall she bear a son, whom
                                Hermes shall bring to the Horai and to Gaia, and they shall gaze in
                                wonder at their lapling, and feed him with nectar and ambrosia, and
                                make him an immortal Zeus and a pure Apollo, God of Fields, God of
                                Pasture; to mortal men, Aristaios. So saying he made the god ready
                                for the fulfilment of wedlock (vv. 63-72). Swift the achievement,
                                short the paths of hastening gods. That day wrought all, and they
                                were made one in the golden chamber of Libya, where she guards a
                                fair, fair city, famed for contests. And now the son of Karneiades
                                crowned her with the flower of fortune at Pytho, where he proclaimed
                                Kyrene, who shall welcome him to his own country, land of fair
                                women, with glory at his side (vv. 73-81).</p>
                            <p>Great achievements are aye full of stories. To broider well a few
                                among so many &mdash; that is a hearing for the skilled. Of
                                these the central height is Opportunity &mdash; Opportunity,
                                which Iolaos did not slight, as seven-gated Thebes knew. Him, when
                                he had shorn away Eurystheus' head, they buried in the tomb of
                                Amphitryon, his father's father, who came to Thebes a guest (vv.
                                82-90). To this Amphitryon and to Zeus, Alkmena bare at one labor
                                two mighty sons. A dullard is the man who does not lend his mouth to
                                Alkmena's son, and does not alway remember the Dirkaian waters that
                                reared him and his brother Iphikles. To whom, in payment of a vow
                                for the requital of their grace to me <pb n="337"/> I will sing a
                                revel song of praise. May not the clear light of the Muses of
                                Victory forsake me, for I have already sung this city thrice in
                                Aigina, at Megara (vv. 91-99), and escaped by achievement the charge
                                of helpless dumbness. Hence be a man friend or be he foe, let him
                                not break the commandment of old Nereus and hide the merit of a
                                noble toil. He bade praise with heartiness and full justice him that
                                worketh fair deeds. (So let all jealousy be silent. Well hast thou
                                wrought.) At the games of Pallas mute the virgins desired thee as
                                lord, (loud the mothers) thee as son, Telesikrates, when they saw
                                the many victories thou didst win (vv. 100-108).</p>
                            <p>So at the Olympian games of Kyrene, so at the games of Gaia and at
                                all the contests of the land. But while I am quenching the thirst of
                                my songs, there is one that exacts a debt not paid, and I must awake
                                the glory of thine old forefathers, how for the sake of a Libyan
                                woman they went to Irasa &mdash; suitors for the daughter of
                                Antaios. Many wooed her, kinsmen and strangers &mdash; for she
                                was wondrous fair (vv. 109-117) &mdash; all eager to pluck the
                                flower of youthful beauty. The father, planning a more famous
                                wedding for his daughter, had heard how Danaos had found speedy
                                bridal for his eight-and-forty virgins ere midday should overtake
                                them, by ranging all that had come as suitors for his daughters, to
                                decide who should have them by contests of swiftness (vv. 118-126).
                                Like offer made the Libyan for wedding a bridegroom to his daughter.
                                He placed her by the mark as the highest prize, and bade him lead
                                her home who should first touch her robes. Then Alexidamos
                                outstripped the rest in the whirlwind race, took the noble maid by
                                the hand, and led her through the throng of the Nomad horsemen. Many
                                leaves they threw on them and wreaths; many wings of Victory had he
                                received before (vv. 127-135).</p>
                            <p>The ode, beautiful in details, has perplexed commentators both as to
                                its plan and as to its drift. The limpid myth of Kyrene has been
                                made to mirror lust and brutality. Telesikrates is supposed by one
                                to have violated a Theban maiden, by another to be warned against
                                deflouring his Theban betrothed until he is legally married to her.
                                It is hard to resist the impression of a prothalamion as well as of
                                an <foreign lang="xgreek">epinikion</foreign>, but all conditions
                                are satisfied by the stress laid on <foreign lang="greek"
                                >kairo/s</foreign>, which Leopold Schmidt has made the pivot. Mezger
                                happily calls the <pb n="338"/> ode &ldquo;Das Hohelied vom
                                    <foreign lang="greek">*kairo/s</foreign>,&rdquo;
                                &ldquo;the Song of Songs, which is Season's.&rdquo; The key
                                is v. 84: <foreign lang="greek">o( de\ kairo\s o(moi/ws</foreign>

                                korufa/n</foreign>. The poet, following his own canon &mdash;

                                to show that the laggard wins no prize. Witness how Apollo, no
                                laggard in love, seized Kyrene (<foreign lang="greek">w)kei=a d'
                                    e)peigome/nwn h)/dh qew=n</foreign> &verbar; <foreign
                                    lang="greek">pra=cis o(doi/ te braxei=ai</foreign>, v. 73); how
                                Iolaos, no dastard in war, shore off the head of Eurystheus (v. 87).
                                Witness Antaios (v. 114), who caught from Danaos the lesson of
                                speedy marriage for his daughter (<foreign lang="greek">w)ku/taton
                                    ga/mon</foreign>). Witness Alexidamos (v. 131), who won the
                                prize by his impetuous rush in the race (<foreign lang="greek">fu/ge
                                    laiyhro\n dro/mon</foreign>). Mezger, who emphasizes the
                                recurrence of <foreign lang="greek">au)ti/ka</foreign> (vv. 31, 62,
                                124), shows, in perhaps unnecessary detail, that the poem breathes
                                unwonted determination and energy, and thinks that it is intended to
                                urge the victor to make quick use of his victory for pressing his
                                suit to some eligible maiden. The poet is to be to Telesikrates what
                                Cheiron was to Apollo. This view seems to me rather German than
                                Greek, but it is not so unbearable as Dissen's rape and
                                B&ouml;ckh's caution against the anticipation of the lawful joys
                                of marriage.</p>
                            <p>The poem has certain marked points of resemblance and contrast with
                                P. 3. As in P. 3, the myth begins early; as in P. 3, the foremost
                                figure is a heroine beloved of Apollo. There the god espies his
                                faithless love &mdash; wanton Koronis &mdash; in the arms of
                                Ischys. Here he finds the high-hearted Kyrene struggling, unarmed,
                                with a lion. There Cheiron was charged with the rearing of the seed
                                of the god. Here Cheiron is summoned to leave his cave and witness
                                the courage of the heroine. The fruit of this love is not snatched
                                from the body of the mother fordone, and borne in haste to the
                                foster-father, but the child is taken by Hermes, in virtue of his
                                office, is fed with nectar and ambrosia by the Horai and Gaia, and
                                becomes, not an Asklepios, to perish in lightning flame, but an
                                Aristaios.</p>
                            <p>In P. 9, as in P. 4, the myth comes to the front, the myth of Kyrene
                                occupying three fifths of the ode. Iolaos dominates one fifth,
                                Alexidamos the last.</p>
                            <p>The rhythms are Dorian (dactylo-epitrite). They are lighter than the
                                norm (O. 3), and hence are supposed to be a mixture of Dorian and
                                Lydian. <pb n="339"/></p>

                            <p>A peculiar interest attaches to this poem as the earliest work of
                                Pindar that we have, for, according to the common count, the poet
                                was only twenty years old when he composed the tenth Pythian in
                                honor of the victory of Hippokleas, <foreign lang="greek">pai=s
                                    diaulodro/mos</foreign>, Pyth. 22 (Ol. 69, 3 = 502 B.C.). The
                                Scholiast says that Hippokleas gained another victory the same day
                                in the single-dash foot-race (<foreign lang="greek"
                                >stadi/w|</foreign>), but no direct mention of it is made in this
                                poem. The father of Hippokleas had overcome twice at Olympia as
                                    <foreign lang="greek">o(plitodro/mos</foreign>, once at Pytho in
                                an ordinary race. Pindar was employed for this performance not by
                                the family of Hippokleas, but by the Aleuadai of Larisa. Dissen
                                thinks that the ode was sung at Larisa, B&ouml;ckh at Pelinna,
                                the home of Hippokleas.</p>
                            <p>Always an aristocrat, at the time of P. 10 Pindar had not reached the
                                years of balance in which even he could see some good in the
                                    <foreign lang="greek">la/bros strato/s</foreign>. Here he simply
                                repeats the cant of his class. He is what we may suppose the Kyrnos
                                of Theognis to have been when he started life, and this poem is
                                redolent of the young aristocracy to which P. belonged. The Persian
                                war had not yet come with its revelation. &ldquo;The Gods and
                                the Good Men,&rdquo; that is his motto, but the good men must be
                                of his own choosing. He believed in God, he believed also in Blood.
                                The praise of Hippokleas, as aristocratic as his name, was a
                                congenial theme. &ldquo;Rich is Lakedaimon, blessed is Thessaly;
                                o'er both the seed of Herakles bears sway.&rdquo; This is the
                                high keynote of the poem &mdash; the name of Herakles, the pride
                                of race. &ldquo;Is this an untimely braggart song?&rdquo; he
                                asks. &ldquo;Nay, I am summoned by Pytho and the Aleuadai,
                                descendants of Herakles, to bring to Hippokleas a festal voice of
                                minstrels&rdquo; &mdash; Pytho and the Aleuadai, God and
                                Blood (vv. 1-6). &ldquo;For Hippokleas maketh trial of contests,
                                and the Parnassian gorge hath proclaimed him foremost of boys in the
                                double course. Apollo, achievement and <pb n="350"/> beginning wax
                                sweet alike when God giveth the impulse, and it was by thy counsels
                                that he accomplished this, but by inborn valor hath he trodden in
                                the footsteps of his father.&rdquo; Apollo gave the
                                accomplishment, the father the native vigor &mdash; God and
                                Blood again (vv. 7-13). &ldquo;That father was twice victorious
                                at Olympia, clad in the armor of Ares, and the field of contests
                                'neath the rock of Kirrha proclaimed him victor in the footrace. May
                                fortune attend them in after-days also with flowers of
                                wealth.&rdquo; May Blood have the blessing of God (vv. 13-18).</p>
                            <p>Now follows the moral, not other for the youthful poet than for the
                                gray-haired singer, and Pindar prays for Pelinna as he is afterwards
                                to pray for Aigina (P. 8, end). &ldquo;Having gained no small
                                share of the pleasant things of Hellas, may they suffer no envious
                                reverses from the gods. Granted that God's heart suffers no anguish,
                                'tis not so with men. A happy man is he in the eyes of the wise, and
                                a theme for song, who by prowess of hand or foot gains the greatest
                                prizes by daring and by strength (vv. 19-24), and in his lifetime
                                sees his son obtain the Pythian wreath. Higher fortune there is none
                                for him. The brazen heaven he cannot mount, he has sailed to the
                                furthest bound. By ships nor by land canst thou find the marvellous
                                road to the Hyperboreans&rdquo; (vv. 25-30).</p>
                            <p>Then follows the brief story of Perseus' visit to the Hyperboreans, a
                                land of feasts and sacrifices. The Muse dwells there, and everywhere
                                there is the swirl of dancing virgins, with the music of lyre and
                                flute. Their heads are wreathed with golden laurels, and they
                                banquet sumptuously. Disease nor old age infests this consecrated
                                race.</p>
                            <p>The land of the Hyperboreans is a glorified Thessaly, and P. was to
                                come back to it years after in O. 3. What Perseus saw, what Perseus
                                wrought, was marvellous; but was he not the son of Dana&euml;,
                                was he not under the guidance of Athena? (v. 45). And so we have an
                                echo of the duality with which the poem began; and as Pindar, in the
                                second triad (v. 21), bows before the power of God, so in the third
                                (v. 48) he says: <foreign lang="greek">e)moi\ de\

                                    <foreign lang="greek">e)/mmen a)/piston</foreign>.</p>
                            <p>And now, with the same sudden start that we find in his later poems,
                                Pindar returns to the victor and himself. And yet he is haunted by
                                the image of the Hyperboreans, and as he hopes &ldquo;that his
                                song sweetly sung by the Ephyraian chorus will make Hippokleas still
                                more a wonder for his victories mid elders as mid <pb n="351"/>
                                mates, and to young virgins a sweet care,&rdquo; the notes of
                                the lyres and the pipings of the flutes and the dances of the
                                Hyperborean maidens (vv. 38-40) come before him. Again a moralizing
                                strain is heard. The highest blessing is the blessing of the day.
                                &ldquo;What each one striveth for, if gained, he must hold as
                                his near and dear delight. That which is to be a year hence is
                                beyond all ken&rdquo; (vv. 61, 62). What is that but the

                                    >a(rpale/an fronti/da</foreign>), and a year was a longer time
                                for him in P. 22 than in Ol. 77. Then P. thanks the magnate who
                                yoked this four-horse chariot of the Pierides, the chariot which
                                would never be yoked on so momentous occasion for the poet (see
                                    <bibl n="Pind. O. 6">O. 6.22</bibl>), and the ode closes with
                                a commendation of the noble brethren who bear up the state of the
                                Thessalians. On them, the Good Men, depends the blessing of the
                                right governance of the cities ruled by their fathers (vv. 55-72).
                                The last word of the fourth triad is the praise of Blood, as the
                                great thought of the third is God.</p>
                            <p>Leopold Schmidt has detected the signs of youthfulness in every
                                element of the poem &mdash; in periodology, in plan, in
                                transitions, in the consciousness of newly acquired art, in the
                                treatment of the myth, in the tropology, in the metres, in the
                                political attitude. In an edition like this the examination of so
                                subtile a study cannot find a place. A few words on the general
                                subject will be found in the <ref target="i2s6" targOrder="U"
                                    >Introductory Essay, p. lvii.</ref></p>
                            <p>It is noteworthy that the triads do not overlap. Praise occupies the
                                first triad; prayer, fortified by an illustration of God's power,
                                the next two; hope takes up the fourth.</p>
                            <p>The measures are logaoedic. The mood is set down as a mixture of
                                Aiolian and Lydian.</p>

                                in Pylades and in Kastor the reflection of that unnamed friend. The
                                ode shows that Thrasydaios belonged to a wealthy and prominent
                                family. His father had been successful at Pytho (v. 43), and another
                                of the same house had gained a victory with a chariot at Olympia (v.
                                47). The song was sung in the procession to the temple of Ismenian
                                Apollo, to whom the prizer was to return thanks for the guerdon of a
                                victory.</p>
                            <p>Pindar calls on the daughters of Kadmos and Harmonia to chant Themis
                                and Pytho in honor of the victory of Thrasydaios, which he won in
                                the land of Pylades, the host of Orestes (vv. 116).</p>
                            <p>Upon this invocation &mdash; an unbroken sentence that extends
                                through a whole triad and bristles with proper names &mdash;
                                follows the familiar story of Orestes, which ends here with the
                                death of Klytaimnestra and her paramour, Aigisthos, a myth which
                                hardly seems to belong to a joyous <foreign lang="xgreek"
                                >epinikion</foreign> (vv. 17-37).</p>
                            <p>If Pindar had kept his usual proportion, the story would have
                                extended through the third triad, but, with a common poetical
                                device, he exclaims that he has been whirled out of his course,
                                summons the Muse to fulfil the promised task, and praises the
                                achievements of Pythonikos, the father, and Thrasydaios, the <pb
                                    n="358"/> son, recounting how the house had won in the
                                chariot-race at Olympia and put to shame their rivals at Pytho (vv.
                                38-50).</p>
                            <p>Then, putting himself in the victor's place, P. prays for a right
                                spirit, for the love of what is noble, for self-control in the midst
                                of effort. Hence the middle rank is best, not the lofty fate of
                                overlords. But if the height is scaled, then avoid insolence. Such a
                                noble soul is Thrasydaios, son of Pythonikos; such Iolaos, son of
                                Iphikles; such Kastor and Polydeukes, sons of the gods, who dwell
                                one day at Therapnai, one within Olympos (vv. 51-64).</p>
                            <p>The eleventh Pythian has given the commentators much trouble. In most
                                of the odes the meaning of the myth, its office as an incorporation
                                of the thought, can, at least, be divined. Here the uncertainty of
                                the date and the unusual character of the story combine to baffle
                                historical interpretation. Historical romances have been framed to
                                fit the supposed fortunes of the house of Thrasydaios. The figures
                                of Agamemnon, Klytaimnestra, Kassandra, Orestes, have been made to
                                represent, now political characters, now political combinations and
                                conflicts. What does the praise of the middle estate mean? What
                                light does that throw on the question of the date? Or are we simply
                                to say that the poem belongs to a period in Pindar's earlier career,
                                when he had not yet acquired the art of handling the myth, and is
                                the story of Orestes a mere ornament, without deeper significance?</p>
                            <p>The two main difficulties, then, are the selection of the myth of
                                Orestes and the praise of the middle estate. Apart from all
                                historical side-lights, which here seem to confuse rather than to
                                help, the meaning of the myth of Orestes is given by the poet in the
                                line <foreign lang="greek">i)/sxei te ga\r o)/lbos ou) mei/ona
                                    fqo/non</foreign> (v. 29). This is true of all the figures in
                                the piece &mdash; Agamemnon, Klytaimnestra, Aigisthos, Orestes.
                                Pindar does not carry out the story of Orestes, simply because he
                                feels that he might do what some of his commentators have done so
                                often, and push the parallel between the hero of the myth and the
                                hero of the games too far. So he drops the story, as he has done
                                elsewhere &mdash; drops it just as Bellerophon is dismissed (O.
                                13) when his further fortunes would be ominous. The return to the
                                praise of Thrasydaios and his house is, however, a reinforcement of
                                the moral Pindar has just been preaching &mdash; the moral that
                                lies in the myth &mdash; and when he reaches the point at which
                                the house of Thrasydaios put the <pb n="359"/> Greeks to shame by
                                their speed, he pauses and prays for moderation, the corrective of
                                too great prosperity. This is all too high for him, the glory is too
                                great. So, in the commonwealth, he chooses the middle station and
                                dreads the fortunes of tyrants. The feats he aims at are within the
                                common reach. And yet even the highest is not in danger of envy, if
                                there is no o'erweening pride nor insolence. Witness Iolaos, a
                                Theban, townsman of Thrasydaios; witness Kastor and Polydeukes,
                                brothers of Klytaimnestra. Doubtless this is not all that the poem
                                means &mdash; but shall we ever know more?</p>
                            <p>The first triad is occupied with the introduction. The myth begins
                                with the beginning of the second triad, but is stopped in the third
                                triad by the whirl (v. 38), which prepares the return to the victor
                                and his house.</p>

                            <p>Midas of Akragas, a famous <foreign lang="greek">au)lhth/s</foreign>,
                                master of the Athenian Lamprokles, who in his turn taught Sophokles
                                and Damon, was victorious in <foreign lang="greek"
                                >au)/lhsis</foreign> twice, Pyth. 24 and 25, and likewise, according
                                to the Scholia, at the Panathenaic games. We do not know positively
                                for which of the two victories at Pytho this poem was composed; but
                                if Pindar had been celebrating the second victory, he would,
                                according to his usual manner, have mentioned the first. If this is
                                the first victory, the poem belongs to the same year with P. 6 (494
                                B.C.), in which Pindar celebrated the success of another
                                Agrigentine, his friend Xenokrates, brother of Theron, and we have
                                in P. 12 one of Pindar's earliest odes.</p>
                            <p>The contest in <foreign lang="greek">au)lw|di/a</foreign> (song with
                                flute accompaniment) was abolished at the second Pythiad, and the
                                game at which Midas won was the <foreign lang="greek">yilh\
                                    au)/lhsis</foreign>. The antique <foreign lang="greek"
                                >au)lo/s</foreign>, like the old English flute, was a kind of
                                clarionet, with a metallic mouth-piece, and one or two tongues or
                                reeds. Midas had the ill-luck to break the mouth-piece of his flute,
                                but continued his playing, to the great delight of his audience, and
                                succeeded in winning the prize.</p>
                            <p>The poem is constructed on the usual Pindaric lines. It announces the
                                victory, tells of the origin of flute music, the invention of the
                                tune called <foreign lang="greek">kefala=n polla=n no/mos</foreign>
                                    (<foreign lang="greek">poluke/falos no/mos</foreign>), and
                                returns to the victor with some not unfamiliar reflections on moil
                                and toil linked with prosperity.</p>
                            <p>According to Mezger, <foreign lang="greek">e)feu=re</foreign>, v. 7,
                                and <foreign lang="greek">eu(=ren</foreign>, v. 22, which mark
                                beginning and end of the myth, show the tendency of the poem. The
                                value of the victory consists in its having been gained in an art
                                invented by Athena.</p>
                            <p>Mezger notices a resemblance to O. 3 in the handling of the myth. In
