<p>At the close of the <title>Oedipus Tyrannus</title> the situation is <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Situation at the end of the <title>Tyrannus.</title></note> briefly this.  By the fact of the guilt which has been brought home to him Oedipus is tacitly considered to have forfeited the throne.  His two sons being still young boys, their maternal uncle, Creon, succeeds to the direction of affairs.  The selfblinded Oedipus, in his first agony of horror and despair, beseeches Creon to send him away from Thebes.  Let him no longer pollute it by his presence: let him perish in the wilds of Cithaeron, as his parents would have had it.  Creon replies that he cannot assume the responsibility of acceding to the wish of Oedipus: the oracle at Delphi must be consulted.  If Apollo says that Oedipus is to be sent away from Thebes, then it shall be done.
</p>
<p>Sophocles supposes a long interval&mdash;some twenty years, <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Events of the interval between the plays.</note> perhaps&mdash;between the two dramas of which Oedipus is the hero. As the exile himself says, <cit><bibl n="Soph. OC 395">395</bibl><quote lang="en">"'Tis little to uplift old age, when youth was ruined."</quote></cit> We have to make out the events of this interval, as best we can, from stray hints in the <title>Coloneus</title><note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="1" resp="RCJ"><p>The Greek title of the play is <title lang="greek">*oi)di/pous e)pi\ *kolwnw=|</title>,&mdash;the prep. meaning <emph>at</emph>, as in such phrases as <foreign lang="greek">e)p' e)sxa/rh|</foreign> (<bibl n="Hom. Od. 7.160"><title>Od.</title> 7.160</bibl>), <foreign lang="greek">e)pi\ qu/rais</foreign>, etc. It is cited by the authors of the Arguments as <title lang="greek">o( e)pi\ *kolwnw=| *oi)di/pous</title> (pp. 3 ff.). The earlier play was doubtless called simply <title lang="greek">*oi)di/pous</title> by Sophocles,&mdash;<foreign lang="greek">*tu/rannos</foreign> having been a later addition (cp. <bibl n="Soph. OT"><title>O. T.</title></bibl> p. 4): but the second play required a distinguishing epithet, and the words <foreign lang="greek">e)pi\ *kolwnw=|</foreign> must be ascribed to the poet himself. The traditional Latin title, <title lang="la">Oedipus Coloneus,</title> is from <bibl n="Cic. Sen. 7.21">Cic. <title>De Sen.</title> 7.21</bibl>, where it occurs in the accus., <title>Oedipum Coloneum.</title> Did Cicero intend <title>Coloneum</title> to represent <foreign lang="greek">*kolw/neion</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">*kolwne/a</foreign>? In other words, ought we to pronounce <emph>Colon&emacr;&uuml;s</emph> or <emph>Colon&emacr;&umacr;s</emph>? 1. In favour of the former view, which seems much the more probable, we may observe two points. (i) In <bibl n="Cic. Fin. 5.1.3"><title>De Fin.</title> 5. 1 &sect; 3</bibl> Cicero writes: <cit><bibl n="Cic. Fin. 5.1.3"></bibl><quote lang="la">&ldquo;Nam me ipsum huc modo venientem convertebat ad sese <emph>Coloneus ille locus</emph>, cuius incola Sophocles ob oculos obversabatur; quem scis quam admirer, quamque eo delecter.&rdquo;</quote></cit> There, <foreign lang="la">locus Coloneus</foreign>, as a periphrasis for <foreign lang="la">Colonus</foreign>, represents <foreign lang="greek">to/pos *kolw/neios</foreign>, not <foreign lang="greek">to/pos *kolwneu/s</foreign>. (ii) <foreign lang="greek">*kolwneu/s</foreign> (properly, a demesman of Colonus, <title>Corp. Inscr.</title> 172. 42) would not have been appropriate in the title of this play, since it would have implied that Oedipus had been resident at Colonus. In the <title lang="greek">*glau=kos *potnieu/s</title> of Aeschylus (<bibl>Nauck, <title>Trag. Fragm.</title> 34-41</bibl>) Glaucus was supposed to have had a fixed abode at Potniae. On the other hand, <foreign lang="la">Coloneus</foreign>, as=<foreign lang="greek">*kolw/neios</foreign>, might well have been used by Cicero to express the same sense as <foreign lang="greek">e)pi\ *kolwnw=|</foreign> (which would have been more closely rendered by <foreign lang="la">ad Colonum</foreign>),&mdash;"at Colonus," <q lang="en" direct="unspecified">connected with it.</q> The Greek adjectives in <foreign lang="greek">eios</foreign> which Cicero transliterates usually answer to names of persons, not of places (as <cit><bibl n="Cic. Fin. 2.7.20"><title>De Fin.</title> 2. 7 &sect; 20</bibl> <quote lang="la">Aristippeo</quote></cit>; <cit><bibl n="Cic. Fin. 2.7.22"><foreign lang="la">ib.</foreign> &sect; 22</bibl> <quote lang="la">Epicurea</quote></cit>); but here he could hardly have used <foreign lang="la">Colonensis</foreign>, which would have suggested a native or inhabitant of the place.
</p>
<p>2. While decidedly preferring the view just stated, I must, however, also notice what can fairly be said in favour of the other view,&mdash;that by <foreign lang="la">Coloneum</foreign> Cicero meant <foreign lang="greek">*kolwne/a</foreign>. (i) In <bibl n="Cic. Tusc. 5.12.34"><title>Tusc. Disp.</title> 5. 12 &sect; 34</bibl> he has <foreign lang="la">Zeno Citieus</foreign>=<foreign lang="greek">*kitieu/s</foreign> (for which Gellius uses <foreign>Citiensis</foreign>): in <cit><bibl n="Cic. Div. 2.42.88"><title>De Div.</title> 2. 42 &sect; 88</bibl> <quote lang="la">Scylax Halicarnasseus</quote></cit>=<foreign lang="greek">*(alikarnasseu/s</foreign> (for which Livy uses <foreign lang="la">Halicarnassensis</foreign>, and Tacitus <foreign lang="la">Halicarnassius</foreign>);&mdash;as similarly, he sometimes retains Greek forms in <foreign lang="greek">i/ths</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">ia/ths</foreign> (<cit><bibl n="Cic. N.D. 1.23.63"><title>De Nat.</title> 1. 23 &sect; 63</bibl> <quote lang="la">Abderites Protagoras</quote></cit>:  <cit><bibl n="Cic. N.D. 1.23.29"><foreign lang="la">ib.</foreign> &sect; 29</bibl> <quote lang="la">Diogenes Apolloniates</quote></cit>). Hence, the nomin. <title lang="la">Oedipus Coloneus</title>, if it had occurred in Cicero, might well have stood for <foreign lang="greek">*oi)di/pous *kolwneu/s</foreign>. (ii) With regard to the accus. of Latin adjectives taken from Greek forms in <foreign lang="greek">eu/s</foreign>, cp. <cit><bibl n="Cic. Att. 7.3.10">Cic. <title>ad Att.</title> 3 &sect; 10,</bibl> <quote lang="la">Venio ad Piraeea; in quo magis reprehendendus sum, quod homo Romanus <emph>Piraeea</emph> scripserim, non <emph>Piraeeum</emph> (sic enim omnes nostri locuti sunt).</quote></cit> It may, indeed, be said that, if he wrote <foreign lang="la">Piraeea</foreign>, he might also have ventured on <foreign lang="la">Colonea:</foreign> but more weight seems due to the other fact,&mdash;that, if he had represented <foreign lang="greek">*kolwne/a</foreign> by <foreign lang="la">Coloneum</foreign> he would have been warranted by Roman usage. It is just possible, then, that by <foreign lang="la">Coloneum</foreign> Cicero meant <foreign lang="greek">*kolwne/a</foreign>, though it seems much more likely that he meant <foreign lang="greek">*kolw/neion</foreign>. [The form <foreign lang="greek">*kolw/neios</foreign> does not seem to be actually extant in Greek. In the scholia on vv. 60, 65 of the play the men of Colonus are called <foreign lang="greek">*kolwnia=tai</foreign>, probably a corruption of <foreign lang="greek">*kolwni=tai</foreign>. The latter term was applied by Hypereides to the artisans frequenting the Colonus Agoraeus (Pollux 7. 132), and is miswritten <foreign lang="greek">*kolwnai=tai</foreign> in Harpocration.]</p></note>.
</p>
<p>The promise with which Creon pacified Oedipus at the end of the <title>Tyrannus</title> does not appear to have been fulfilled. The oracle was not consulted as to whether Oedipus should remain at Thebes. He remained there; and, as the lapse of time softened his anguish, the blind and discrowned sufferer learned to love the seclusion of the house in which he had once reigned so brilliantly. Creon continued to act as regent. But at last a change took place in the disposition of the Thebans, or at least <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Expulsion of Oedipus.</note>in Creon's. A feeling grew up that Thebes was harbouring a defilement, and it was decided to expel Oedipus. There is no  mention of an oracle as the cause; indeed, the idea of a divine mandate is incompatible with the tenor of the story, since Oedipus could not then have charged the whole blame on Thebes. One circumstance of his expulsion was bitter to him above all the rest. His two sons, who had now reached manhood, said not a word in arrest of his doom.
</p>
<p>But his two daughters were nobly loyal. Antigone went forth from Thebes with her blind father,&mdash;his sole attendant,&mdash; and thenceforth shared the privations of his lot, which could now be only that of a wandering mendicant. Ismene stayed at Thebes, but it was in order to watch the course of events there in her father's interest. We hear of one occasion, at least, on which she risked a secret journey for the purpose of acquainting him with certain oracles which had just been received. The incident marks the uneasy feeling with which the Thebans still regarded the blind exile, and their unwillingness that he should share such light on his own destiny as they could obtain from Apollo.
</p>
<p>Oedipus had now grown old in his destitute wanderings, when a sacred mission sent from Thebes to Delphi brought back an oracle concerning him which excited a lively interest in the minds of his former subjects. It was to the effect that the <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">The new oracle.</note> welfare of Thebes depended on Oedipus, not merely while he lived, but also after his death. The Thebans now conceived the desire of establishing Oedipus somewhere just beyond their border. In this way they thought that they would have him under their control, while at the same time they would avoid the humiliation of confessing themselves wrong, and receiving him back to dwell among them. Their main object was that, on his death, they might secure the guardianship of his grave.
</p>
<p>The new oracle obviously made an opportunity for the sons of Oedipus at Thebes, if they were true to their banished father. They could urge that Apollo, by this latest utterance, had condoned any pollution that might still be supposed to attach to the person of Oedipus, and had virtually authorised his recall to his ancient realm. Thebes could not be defiled by the presence of a man whom the god had declared to be the arbiter of its fortunes.
</p>
<p>Unhappily, the sons&mdash;Polyneices and Eteocles&mdash;were no longer in a mood to hear the dictates of filial piety. When they had first reached manhood, they had been oppressed by a sense of the curse on their family, and the taint on their own birth. They had wished to spare Thebes the contamination of their rule; they had been desirous that the regent,&mdash;their uncle Creon,&mdash;should become king. But presently,&mdash;<cit><bibl n="Soph. OC 371">371</bibl><quote lang="en">"moved by some god, and by a sinful mind,"</quote></cit>&mdash;compelled by the inexorable Fury of their house,&mdash;they renounced these intentions of wise selfdenial. Not only were they fired with the passion for power, <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">The strife between the sons.</note>but they fell to striving with each other for the sole power. Eteocles, the younger<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="1" resp="RCJ">See <ref target="cl375" targOrder="U">note on v. 375</ref>.</note> brother, managed to win over the citizens. The elder brother, Polyneices, was driven out of Thebes. He went to Argos, where he married the daughter of king Adrastus. All the most renowned warriors of the Peloponnesus became his allies, and he made ready to lead a great host against Thebes. But, while the mightiest chieftains were marshalling their followers in his cause, the voices of prophecy warned him that the issue of his mortal feud depended on the blind and aged beggar whom, years before, he had coldly seen thrust out from house and home. That side would prevail which Oedipus should join.
</p></div2>
<div2 id="cis2" type="section" n="2">
<p><note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Analysis of the play.</note></p>
<p>This is the moment at which our play begins. The action falls into six principal divisions or chapters, marked off, as usual, by choral lyrics.
</p>
<p><note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">I. <bibl n="Soph. OC 1">Prologue: 1-116</bibl>.</note>The scene, which remains the same throughout the play, is at Colonus, about a mile and a quarter north-west of Athens. We are in front of a grove sacred to the Furies,&mdash;here worshipped under a propitiatory name, as the Eumenides or Kindly Powers. While the snow still lingers on distant hills (<bibl n="Soph. OC 1060">v. 1060</bibl>), the song of many nightingales is already heard from the thick covert of this grove in the Attic plain; we seem to breathe the air of a bright, calm day at the beginning of April<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="2" resp="RCJ">The dates of the nightingale's arrival in Attica, for the years indicated, are thus given by Dr Kr&uuml;per, the best authority on the birds of Greece (<bibl><title lang="de">Griechische Jahrzeiten</title> for 1875, Heft III., p. 243</bibl>):&mdash;<date value="1867-03-29">March 29 (1867)</date>, <date value="1873-04-13">April 13 (1873)</date>, <date value="1874-04-06">April 6 (1874)</date>. The dates for several other localities in the Hellenic countries (Acarnania&mdash; Parnassus&mdash;Thessalonica&mdash;Olympia&mdash;Smyrna), as recorded by the same observer for two years in each case, all range between March 27 and April 15. For this reference I am indebted to Professor Alfred Newton, F.R.S., of Cambridge. The male birds (who alone sing) arrive some days before the females, as is usually the case with migratory birds, and sing as soon as they come. Thus it is interesting to notice that the period of the year at which the nightingale's song would first be heard in Attica coincides closely with the celebration of the Great Dionysia, in the last days of March and the first days of April (<bibl>C. Hermann <title>Gr. Ant.</title> II. 59. 6</bibl>). If the play was produced at that festival, the allusions to the nightingale (vv. <bibl n="Soph. OC 18">18</bibl>, <bibl n="Soph. OC 671">671</bibl>) would have been felt as specially appropriate to the season.</note>.  The blind Oedipus, led by Antigone, enters on the left hand of the spectator. He is in the squalid garb of a beggar-man,&mdash; carrying a wallet, wherein to put alms (<bibl n="Soph. OC 1262">v. 1262</bibl>); the wind plays with his unkempt white hair; the wounds by which, in the prime of manhood, he had destroyed his sight, have left ghastly traces on the worn face; but there is a certain nobleness in his look and bearing which tempers the beholder's sense of pity or repulsion. The old man is tired with a long day's journey; they have heard from people whom they met on the way that they are near Athens, but they do not know the name of the spot at which they have halted. Antigone seats her father on a rock which is just within the limits of the sacred grove. As she is about to go in search of information, a man belonging to Colonus appears. Oedipus is beginning to accost him, when the stranger cuts his words short by a peremptory command to come off the sacred ground. "To whom is it sacred?" Oedipus asks. To the Eumenides, is the reply. On hearing that name, Oedipus invokes the grace of those goddesses, and declares that he will never leave the rest which he has found. He begs the stranger to summon Theseus, the king of Athens, <cit><bibl n="Soph. OC 72">72</bibl><quote lang="en">"that by a small service he may find a great gain."</quote></cit> The stranger, who is struck by the noble mien of the blind old man, says that he will go and consult the people of Colonus; and meanwhile he tells Oedipus to stay where he is.
</p>
<p>Left alone with Antigone, Oedipus utters a solemn and very beautiful prayer to the Eumenides, which discloses the motive of his refusal to leave the sacred ground. In his early manhood, when he inquired at Delphi concerning his parentage, Apollo predicted the calamities which awaited him; but also promised  him rest, so soon as he should reach <cit><bibl n="Soph. OC 89">89</bibl><quote lang="en">"<emph>a seat of the Awful Goddesses.</emph>"</quote></cit> There he should close his troubled life; and along with the release, he should have this reward,&mdash;power to benefit the folk who sheltered him, and to hurt the folk who had cast him out. And when his end was near, there should be a sign from the sky. Apollo and the Eumenides themselves have led him to this grove: he prays the goddesses to receive him, and to give him peace.
</p>
<p>Hardly has his prayer been spoken, when Antigone hears footsteps approaching, and retires with her father into the covert of the grove.</p>
<p><note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Parodos: <bibl n="Soph. OC 117">117-253</bibl>.</note>The elders of Colonus, who form the Chorus, now enter the orchestra. They have heard that a wanderer has entered the grove, and are in eager search for the perpetrator of so daring an impiety. Oedipus, led by Antigone, suddenly discovers himself. His appearance is greeted with a cry of horror from the Chorus; but horror gradually yields to pity for his blindness, his age, and his misery. They insist, however, on his coming out of the sacred grove. If he is to speak to them, it must be on lawful ground. Before he consents, he exacts a pledge that he shall not be removed from the ground outside of the grove. They promise this. Antigone then guides him to a seat beyond the sacred precinct. The Chorus now ask him who he is. He implores them to spare the question; but their curiosity has been aroused. They extort an answer. No sooner has the name OEDIPUS passed his lips, than his voice is drowned in a shout of execration. They call upon him to leave Attica instantly. He won their promise by a fraud, and it is void. They refuse to hear him. Antigone makes an imploring appeal.
</p>
<p><note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">II. First episode: <bibl n="Soph. OC 254">254-667</bibl>.</note>In answer to her appeal, the Chorus say that they pity both father and daughter, but fear the gods still more; the wanderers must go.
</p>
<p>Oedipus now speaks with powerful eloquence, tinged at first with bitter scorn. Is this the traditional compassion of Athens for the oppressed? They have lured him from his sanctuary, and now they are driving him out of their country,&mdash;for fear of what? Simply of his name. He is free from moral guilt. He  brings a blessing for Athens. What it is, he will reveal when their king arrives.&mdash;The Chorus agree to await the decision of Theseus. He will come speedily, they are sure, when he hears the name of Oedipus.
</p>
<p>At this moment, Antigone descries the approach of her sister Ismene, who has come from Thebes with tidings for her father. Ismene tells him of the fierce strife which has broken out between her brothers,&mdash;and how Polyneices has gone to Argos. Then she mentions the new oracle which the Thebans have just received,&mdash;that their welfare depends on him, in life and death. Creon will soon come, she adds, in the hope of enticing him back.
</p>
<p>Oedipus asks whether <emph>his sons</emph> knew of this oracle. "Yes," she reluctantly answers. At that answer, the measure of his bitterness is full: he breaks into a prayer that the gods may hear him, and make this new strife fatal to both brothers alike. And then, turning to the Chorus, he assures them that he is destined to be a deliverer of Attica: for his mind is now made up; he has no longer any doubt where his blessing, or his curse, is to descend. The Chorus, in reply, instruct him how a proper atonement may be made to the Eumenides for his trespass on their precinct; and Ismene goes to perform the prescribed rites in a more distant part of the grove.
</p>
<p>Here follows a lyric dialogue between the Chorus and <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">(Kommos:  <bibl n="Soph. OC 510">510-548</bibl>.)</note> Oedipus. They question him on his past deeds, and he pathetically asserts his moral innocence.
</p>
<p>Theseus now enters, on the spectator's right hand, as coming from Athens. Addressing Oedipus as "son of La&iuml;us," he assures him, with generous courtesy, of protection and sympathy; he has himself known what it is to be an exile. Oedipus explains his desire. He craves to be protected in Attica while he lives, and to be buried there when he is dead. He has certain benefits to bestow in return; but these will not be felt until after his decease. He fears that his sons will seek to remove him to Thebes. If Theseus promises to protect him, it must be at the risk of a struggle. Theseus gives the promise. He publicly adopts Oedipus as a citizen. He then leaves the scene.
</p>
<p>Oedipus having now been formally placed under the protection<note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">First stasimon:  <bibl n="Soph. OC 668">668-719</bibl>.</note> of Athens, the Chorus appropriately celebrate the land  which has become his home. Beginning with Colonus, they pass to themes of honour for Attica at large,&mdash;the olive, created by Athena and guarded by Zeus,&mdash;the horses and horsemanship of the land, gifts of Poseidon,&mdash;and his other gift, the empire of the sea. Of all the choral songs in extant Greek drama, this short ode is perhaps the most widely famous; a distinction partly due, no doubt, to the charm of the subject, and especially to the manifest glow of a personal sentiment in the verses which describe Colonus; but, apart from this, the intrinsic poetical beauty is of the highest and rarest order<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="1" resp="RCJ">Dr Heinrich Schmidt, in his <title>Compositionslehre</title>, has selected this First Stasimon as a typical masterpiece of ancient choral composition, and has shown by a thorough analysis (<bibl>pp. 428-432</bibl>) how perfect is the construction, alike from a metrical and from a properly lyric or musical point of view. <quote lang="de">Da ist keine einzige Note unn&uuml;tz,</quote> he concludes; <quote lang="de">jeder Vers, jeder Satz, jeder Takt in dem sch&ouml;nsten rhythmischen Connexe.</quote></note>.
</p>
<p><note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">III. Second episode:  <bibl n="Soph. OC 720">720-1043</bibl>.</note>As the choral praises cease, Antigone exclaims that the moment has come for proving that Athens deserves them. Creon enters, with an escort of guards.
</p>
<p>His speech, addressed at first to the Chorus, is short, and skilfully conceived. They will not suppose that an old man like himself has been sent to commit an act of violence against a powerful State. No; he comes on behalf of Thebes, to plead with his aged kinsman, whose present wandering life is truly painful for everybody concerned. The honour of the city and of the family is involved. Oedipus should express his gratitude to Athens, and then return to a decent privacy <cit><bibl n="Soph. OC 777">777</bibl><quote lang="en">"in the house of his fathers."</quote></cit>
</p>
<p>With a burst of scathing indignation, Oedipus replies. They want him now; but they thrust him out when he was longing to stay. <cit><bibl n="Soph. OC 777">777</bibl><quote lang="en">"In the house of his fathers!"</quote></cit> No, that is not their design. They intend to plant him somewhere just beyond their border, for their own purposes. <cit><bibl n="Soph. OC 787">787</bibl><quote lang="en">"That portion is not for thee,"</quote></cit> he tells Creon, <cit><bibl n="Soph. OC 788">788</bibl><quote lang="en">"but this,&mdash;my curse upon your land, ever abiding therein;&mdash;and for my sons, this heritage&mdash;room enough in my realm, wherein &mdash; to die."</quote> </cit>
</p>
<p>Failing to move him, Creon drops the semblance of persuasion. He bluntly announces that he already holds one hostage;  &mdash;Ismene, who had gone to perform the rites in the grove, has been captured by his guards;&mdash;and he will soon have a second. He lays his hand upon Antigone. Another moment, and his attendants drag her from the scene. He is himself on the point of seizing Oedipus, when Theseus enters,&mdash;having been startled by the outcry, while engaged in a sacrifice at the neighbouring altar of Poseidon.
</p>
<p>On hearing what has happened, Theseus first sends a message to Poseidon's altar, directing the Athenians who were present at the sacrifice to start in pursuit of Creon's guards and the captured maidens.&mdash;Then, turning to Creon, he upbraids him with his lawless act, and tells him that he shall not leave Attica until the maidens are restored. Creon, with ready effrontery, replies that, in attempting to remove a polluted wretch from Attic soil, he was only doing what the Areiopagus itself would have wished to do; if his manner was somewhat rough, the violence of Oedipus was a provocation. This speech draws from Oedipus an eloquent vindication of his life, which is more than a mere repetition of the defence which he had already made to the Chorus. Here he brings out with vivid force the helplessness of man against fate, and the hypocrisy of his accuser.&mdash;Theseus now calls on Creon to lead the way, and show him where the captured maidens are,&mdash;adding a hint, characteristically Greek, that no help from Attic accomplices shall avail him. Creon sulkily submits,&mdash;with a muttered menace of what he will do when he reaches home. <foreign lang="la">Exeunt</foreign> Theseus and his attendants, with Creon, on the spectator's left.
</p>
<p>The Chorus imagine themselves at the scene of the coming <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Second stasimon:  <bibl n="Soph. OC 1044">1044-1095</bibl>.</note> fray, and predict the speedy triumph of the rescuers,&mdash;invoking the gods of the land to help. A beautiful trait of this ode is the reference to the <cit><bibl n="Soph. OC 1049">1049</bibl><quote lang="en">"torch-lit strand"</quote></cit> of Eleusis, and to the mysteries which the initiated poet held in devout reverence.
</p>
<p>At the close of their chant, the Chorus give Oedipus the <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">IV. Third episode:  <bibl n="Soph. OC 1096">1096-1210</bibl>.</note> welcome news that they see his daughters approaching, escorted by Theseus and his followers. The first words of Antigone to her blind father express the wish that some wonder-working god could enable him to see their brave deliverer; and then, with much truth to nature, father and daughters are allowed to  forget for a while that anyone else is present. When at last Oedipus turns to thank Theseus, his words are eminently noble, and also touching. His impulse is to salute his benefactor by kissing his cheek, but it is quickly checked by the thought that this is not for him; no, nor can he permit it, if Theseus would. The line drawn by fate, the line which parts him and his from human fellowship, is rendered only more sacred by gratitude.
</p>
<p>At this point we may note, in passing, a detail of dramatic economy. The story of the rescue would have been material for a brilliant speech, either by Theseus, or, before his entrance, by a messenger. But the poet's sense of fitness would not allow him to adorn an accident of the plot at the cost of curtailing an essential part,&mdash;viz., the later scene with Polyneices, which must have been greatly abridged if a narrative had been admitted here. So, when Antigone is questioned by her father as to the circumstances of the rescue, she refers him to Theseus; and Theseus says that it is needless for <emph>him</emph> to vaunt his own deeds, since Oedipus can hear them at leisure from his daughters.
</p>
<p>There is a matter, Theseus adds, on which he should like to consult Oedipus. A stranger, it seems, has placed himself as a suppliant at the altar of Poseidon. This happened while they were all away at the rescue, and no one knows anything about the man. He is not from Thebes, but he declares that he is a kinsman of Oedipus, and prays for a few words with him. It is only guessed whence he comes; can Oedipus have any relations at Argos? Oedipus remembers what Ismene told him; he knows who it is; and he implores Theseus to spare him the torture of hearing <emph>that</emph> voice. But Antigone's entreaties prevail. Theseus leaves the scene, in order to let the suppliant know that the interview will be granted.
</p>
<p><note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Third stasimon:  <bibl n="Soph. OC 1211">1211-1248</bibl>.</note>The choral ode which fills the pause glances forward rather than backward, though it is suggested by the presage of some new vexation for Oedipus. It serves to turn our thoughts towards the approaching end.&mdash;Not to be born is best of all; the next best thing is to die as soon as possible. And the extreme of folly is the desire to outlive life's joys. Behold yon aged and afflicted stranger,&mdash;lashed by the waves of trouble from east and  west, from south and north! But there is one deliverer, who come to all at last.
</p>
<p>Polyneices now enters,&mdash;not attended, like Creon, by guards, <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">V. Fourth episode:  <bibl n="Soph. OC 1249">1249-1555</bibl>.</note> but alone. He is shedding tears; he begins by uttering the deepest pity for his father's plight, and the bitterest selfreproach.&mdash;Oedipus, with averted head, makes no reply.&mdash; Polyneices appeals to his sisters; will they plead for him? Antigone advises him to state in his own words the object of his visit.&mdash;Then Polyneices sets forth his petition. His Argive allies are already gathered before Thebes. He has come as a suppliant to Oedipus, for himself, and for his friends too. Oracles say that victory will be with the side for which Oedipus may declare. Eteocles, in his pride at Thebes, is mocking father and brother alike. <cit><bibl n="Soph. OC 1340">1340</bibl><quote lang="en">"If thou assist me, I will soon scatter his power, and will stablish thee in thine own house, and stablish myself, when I have cast him out by force."</quote></cit>
</p>
<p>Oedipus now breaks silence; but it is in order to let the <emph>Chorus</emph> know why he does so. His son, he reminds them, has been sent to them by their king.&mdash;Then, suddenly turning on Polyneices, he delivers an appalling curse, dooming both his sons to die at Thebes by each other's hands. In concentrated force of tragic passion this passage has few rivals. The great scene is closed by a short dialogue between Polyneices and his elder sister,&mdash;one of the delicate links between this play and the poet's earlier <title>Antigone</title>.  She implores him to abandon his fatal enterprise. But he is not to be dissuaded; he only asks that, if he falls, she and Ismene will give him burial rites; he disengages himself from their embrace, and goes forth, under the shadow of the curse.
</p>
<p>A lyric passage now follows, which affords a moment of <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">(Kommos:  <bibl n="Soph. OC 1447">1447-1499</bibl>.)</note> relief to the strained feelings of the spectators, and also serves (like a similar passage before, vv. 510&mdash;548) to separate the two principal situations comprised in this chapter of the drama.&mdash; The Chorus are commenting on the dread doom which they have just heard pronounced, when they are startled by the sound of thunder. As peal follows peal, and lightnings glare from the darkened sky, the terror-stricken elders of Colonus utter broken prayers to averting gods. But for Oedipus the  storm has another meaning; it has filled him with a strange eagerness. He prays Antigone to summon Theseus.
</p>
<p>As Theseus had left the scene in order to communicate with the suppliant at Poseidon's altar, no breach of probability is involved in his timely re-appearance. Oedipus announces that, by sure signs, he knows his hour to have come. Unaided by human hand, he will now show the way to the spot where his life must be closed. When he arrives there, to Theseus alone will be revealed the place appointed for his grave. At the approach of death, Theseus shall impart the secret to his heir alone; and, so, from age to age, that sacred knowledge shall descend in the line of the Attic kings. While the secret is religiously guarded, the grave of Oedipus shall protect Attica against invading foemen; Thebes shall be powerless to harm her.&mdash;<cit><bibl n="Soph. OC 1540">1540</bibl><quote lang="en">"And now let us set forth, for the divine summons urges me."</quote></cit> As Oedipus utters these words, Theseus and his daughters become aware of a change; the blind eyes are still dark, but the moral conditions of blindness have been annulled; no sense of dependence remains, no trace of hesitation or timidity; like one inspired, the blind man eagerly beckons them on; and so, followed by them, he finally passes from the view of the spectators.
</p>
<p>This final exit of Oedipus is magnificently conceived. As the idea of a spiritual illumination is one which pervades the play, so it is fitting that, in the last moment of his presence with us, the inward vision should be manifested in its highest clearness and power. It is needless to point out what a splendid opportunity this scene would give to an actor,&mdash;in the modern theatre not less than in the ancient. It shows the genius of a great poet combined with that instinct for dramatic climax which is seldom unerring unless guided by a practical knowledge of the stage.
</p>
<p><note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Fourth stasimon:  <bibl n="Soph. OC 1556">1556-1578</bibl>.</note>The elders of Colonus are now alone; they have looked their last on Oedipus; and they know that the time of his end has come. The strain of their chant is in harmony with this moment of suspense and stillness. It is a choral litany for the soul which is passing from earth. May the Powers of the unseen world be gracious; may no dread apparition vex the path to the fields below.
</p>
<p>A Messenger, one of the attendants of Theseus, relates what <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">VI. Exodos:  <bibl n="Soph. OC 1579">1579-1779</bibl>.</note> befell after Oedipus, followed by his daughters and the king, arrived at the spot where he was destined to depart. Theseus was then left alone with him, and to Theseus alone of mortals the manner of his passing is known.
</p>
<p>The daughters enter. After the first utterances of grief, one <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">(Kommos:  <bibl n="Soph. OC 1670">1670-1750</bibl>.)</note> feeling is seen to be foremost in Antigone's mind,&mdash;the longing to see her father's grave. She cannot bear the thought that it should lack a tribute from her hands. Ismene vainly represents that their father's own command makes such a wish unlawful,&mdash; impossible. Theseus arrives, and to him Antigone urges her desire. In gentle and solemn words he reminds her of the pledge which he had given to Oedipus. She acquiesces; and now prays that she and Ismene may be sent to Thebes: perhaps they may yet be in time to avert death from their brothers. Theseus consents; and the elders of Colonus say farewell to the Theban maidens in words which speak of submission to the gods:  <cit><bibl n="Soph.

<div2 id="cis3" type="section" n="3">
<p>In the <title>Oedipus Tyrannus</title> a man is crushed by the discovery<note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Relation of the <title>Coloneus</title> to the <title>Tyrannus.</title></note> that, without knowing it, he has committed two crimes, parricide and incest. At the moment of discovery he can feel nothing but the double stain: he cries out that <cit><bibl n="Soph. OT 1345">OT 1345</bibl><quote lang="en">"he has become most hateful to the gods."</quote></cit> He has, indeed, broken divine laws, and the divine Power has punished him by bringing his deeds to light. This Power does not, in the first instance, regard the intention, but the fact. It does not matter that his unconscious sins were due to the agency of an inherited curse, and that he is morally innocent. He has sinned, and he must suffer.
</p>
<p>In the <title>Oedipus Coloneus</title> we meet with this man again, after the lapse of several years. In a religious aspect he still rests under the stain, and he knows this. But, in the course of time, he has mentally risen to a point of view from which he can survey his own past more clearly. Consciousness of the stain is now subordinate to another feeling, which in his first despair had not availed to console him. He has gained a firm grasp, not to be lost, on the fact of his moral innocence. He remembers the  word of Apollo long ago, which coupled the prediction of his woes with a promise of final rest and reward; and he believes that his moral innocence is recognised by the Power which punished him. Thinking, then, on the two great facts of his life, his defilement and his innocence, he has come to look upon himself as neither pure nor yet guilty, but as a person set apart by the gods to illustrate their will,&mdash;as sacred. Hence that apparently strange contrast which belongs to the heart of the <title>Oedipus Coloneus.</title> He declines to pollute his benefactor, Theseus, by his touch,&mdash;describing himself as one with whom <cit><quote lang="en">"all stain of sin hath made its dwelling"</quote><bibl n="Soph. OC 1133"> (1133)</bibl></cit>. Yet, with equal truth and sincerity, he can assure the Athenians that he has come to them <cit><bibl n="Soph. OC 287">287</bibl><quote lang="en">"as one sacred and pious,"</quote></cit>&mdash;the suppliant of the Eumenides, the disciple of Apollo (<bibl n="Soph. OC 287">287</bibl>).</p>
<p>In the <title>Oedipus Tyrannus</title>, when the king pronounces a ban on the unknown murderer of La&iuml;us, he charges his subjects that no one shall make that man <cit><quote lang="en">"partner of his prayer or sacrifice, or serve him with the lustral rite"</quote><bibl n="Soph. OC 239">(239 f.)</bibl></cit>. Ceremonial purity thus becomes a prominent idea at an early point in the <title>Tyrannus</title>;  and rightly so; for that play turns on acts as such. In the <title>Oedipus Coloneus</title> we have a description of the ritual to be observed in the grove of the Eumenides; but, as if to mark the difference of spirit between the two plays, it is followed by the striking words of Oedipus, when he suggests that a daughter shall officiate in his stead:&mdash;<cit><quote lang="en">"I think that one soul suffices to pay this debt for ten thousand, if it come with good-will to the shrine"</quote><bibl n="Soph. OC 497">(497)</bibl></cit>. When eternal laws are broken by men, the gods punish the breach, whether wilful or involuntary; but their ultimate judgment depends on the intent. That thought is dominant in the <title>Oedipus Coloneus.</title> The contrast between physical blindness and inward vision is an under-note, in harmony with the higher distinction between the form of conduct and its spirit.
</p></div2>
<div2 id="cis4" type="section" n="4">
<p><note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">The Oedipus of this play.</note></p>
<p>The Oedipus whom we find at Colonus utters not a word of self-reproach, except on one point; he regrets the excess of the former self-reproach which stung him into blinding himself. He has done nothing else that calls for repentance; he has been the passive instrument of destiny. It would be a mistake to  aim at bringing the play more into harmony with modern sentiment by suffusing it in a mild and almost Christian radiance, as though Oedipus had been softened, chastened, morally purified by suffering. Suffering has, indeed, taught him endurance (<foreign lang="greek">ste/rgein</foreign>), and some degree of caution; he is also exalted in mind by a new sense of power; but he has not been softened. Anger, <cit><bibl n="Soph. OC 855">(855)</bibl><quote lang="en">"which was ever his bane"</quote></cit>, blazes up in him as fiercely as ever; Creon rebukes him for it; his friends are only too painfully conscious of it. The unrestrained anger of an old man may easily be a very pitiful and deplorable spectacle; in order to be that, it need only be lost to justice and to generosity, to reason and to taste; but it requires the touch of a powerful dramatist to deal successfully with a subject so dangerously near to comedy, and to make a choleric old man tragic; Shakspeare has done it, with pathos of incomparable grasp and range; Sophocles, in a more limited way, has done it too. Throughout the scene with Polyneices there is a malign sublimity in the anger of the aged Oedipus; it is profoundly in the spirit of the antique, and we imply a different standard if we condemn it as vindictive. The Erinys has no mercy for sins against kindred; the man cannot pardon, because the Erinys acts through him. Oedipus at Colonus is a sacred person, but this character depends on his relation to the gods, and not on any inward holiness developed in him by a discipline of pain. Probably the chief danger which the <title>Oedipus Coloneus</title> runs with modern readers is from the sense of repulsion apt to be excited by this inexorable resentment of Oedipus towards his sons. It is not so when Lear cries&mdash;

<quote lang="en"><lg type="blankverse"><l part="F">No, you unnatural hags,</l>
<l>I will have such revenges on you both,</l>
<l>That all the world shall&mdash;I will do such things,&mdash;</l>
<l>What they are yet, I know not; but they shall be</l>
<l>The terrors of the earth. You think I'll weep;</l>
<l part="I">No, I'll not weep.</l></lg></quote>
</p>
<p>Sophocles has left it possible for <emph>us</emph> to abhor the implacable father more than the heartless children. The ancient Greek spectator, however, would have been less likely to experience such a revulsion of sympathy. Nearer to the conditions imagined,  he would more quickly feel all that was implied in the attitude of the sons at the moment when Oedipus was expelled from Thebes; his religious sense would demand a nemesis, while his ethical code would not require forgiveness of wrongs; and, lastly, he would feel that the implacability of Oedipus was itself a manifestation of the Fury which pursued the house.

The gods, who have vexed Oedipus from youth to age, make this amend to him,&mdash;that just before his death he is recognised by men as a mysteriously sacred person, who has the power to bequeath a blessing and a malison. They further provide that his departure out of his wretched life shall be painless, and such as to distinguish him from other men. But their attitude towards him is not that of a Providence which chastises men in love, for their good. They are the inscrutable powers who have had their will of a mortal. If such honour as they concede to him at the last is indeed the completion of a kindly purpose, it is announced only as the end of an arbitrary doom. If it is the crown of a salutary, though bitter, education, it appears only as the final justice (<bibl n="Soph. OC 1567">1567</bibl>) prescribed by a divine sense of measure. In the foreground of the <title>Oedipus Coloneus</title> a weary wanderer is arriving at his goal; but the drama is only half appreciated if we neglect the action which occupies the background. While the old man finds rest, the hereditary curse on his family continues its work. At the very moment when he passes away, the Fury is busy with his sons. The total impression made by the play as a work of art depends essentially on the manner in which the scene of sacred peace at Colonus is brought into relief against the dark fortunes of Polyneices and Eteocles.

<p><note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">The curse on the sons.</note></p>
<p>Here it becomes important to notice an innovation made by Sophocles. In the epic version of the story, as also in the versions adopted by Aeschylus and Euripides, Oedipus cursed his sons at Thebes, before the strife had broken out between them.<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="1" resp="RCJ">See Introduction to the <title>Oedipus Tyrannus</title>, pp. xvi and xix.</note> He doomed them to divide their heritage with the sword.  Their subsequent quarrel was the direct consequence of their father's curse. But, according to Sophocles, the curse had nothing to do with the quarrel. The strife which broke out between the sons was inspired by the evil genius of their race, and by their own sinful thoughts<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="2" resp="RCJ">See vv. <bibl n="Soph.

First, the two sons no longer appear as helpless victims of fate; they have incurred moral blame, and are just objects of the paternal anger. Secondly, when Polyneices&mdash;on the eve of combat with his brother&mdash;appeals to Oedipus, the outraged father still holds the weapon with which to smite him. The curse descends at the supreme crisis, and with more terrible effect because it has been delayed.

<div2 id="cis7" type="section" n="7">
<p>The secondary persons, like the hero, are best interpreted <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">The other characters.</note> by the play itself; but one or two traits may be briefly noticed. The two scenes in which the removal of Oedipus is attempted are contrasted not merely in outward circumstance&mdash;Creon relying on armed force, while Polyneices is a solitary suppliant&mdash;but also in regard to the characters of the two visitors. It is idle to look for the Creon of the <title>Tyrannus</title> in the Creon of the <title>Coloneus:</title> they are different men, and Sophocles has not cared to preserve even a semblance of identity. The Creon of the <title>Tyrannus</title> is marked by strong self-respect, and is essentially kind-hearted, though undemonstrative; the Creon of this play is a heartless and hypocritical villain. A well-meaning but wrongheaded martinet, such as the Creon of the <title>Antigone</title>, is a conceivable development of the <title>Tyrannus</title> Creon, but at least stands on a much higher level than the Creon of the <title>Coloneus.</title> Polyneices is cold-hearted, selfish, and of somewhat coarse fibre, but he is sincere and straightforward; in the conversation with  Antigone he evinces real dignity and fortitude. In the part of Theseus, which might so easily have been commonplace, Sophocles has shown a fine touch; this typical Athenian is more than a walking king; he is a soldier bred in the school of adversity, loyal to gods and men, perfect in courtesy, but stern at need. Comparing the representation of the two sisters in the <title>Antigone</title> with that given in this play, we may remark the tact with which the poet has abstained here from tingeing the character of Ismene with anything like selfish timidity. At the end of the play, where the more passionate nature of the heroic Antigone manifests itself, Ismene is the sister whose calm common-sense is not overpowered by grief; but she grieves sincerely and remains, as she has been throughout, entirely loyal.
</p>
<p><note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Attitude of the Chorus.</note>A word should be added on the conduct of the Chorus in regard to Oedipus. Before they know who he is, they regard him with horror as the man who has profaned the grove; but their feeling quickly changes to compassion on perceiving that he is blind, aged, and miserable. Then they learn his name, and wish to expel him because they conceive his presence to be a defilement. They next relent, not simply because he says that he brings benefits for Athens,&mdash;though they take account of that fact, which is itself a proof that he is at peace with the gods,&mdash;but primarily because he is able to assure them that he is <cit><quote lang="en">"sacred and pious"</quote><bibl n="Soph. OC 287">(287)</bibl></cit>. They then leave the matter to Theseus. Thus these elders of Colonus represent the conflict of two feelings which the situation might be supposed to arouse in the minds of ordinary Athenians,&mdash;fear of the gods, and compassion for human suffering,&mdash;the two qualities which Oedipus recognises as distinctly Athenian (<ref target="cl260" targOrder="U">260 n.</ref>).

<div2 id="cis8" type="section" n="8">
<p><note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">The Oedipus-myth at Colonus.</note></p>
<p>The connection of Oedipus with Colonus was no invention of Sophocles. He found the local legend existing, and only gave it such a form as should harmonise it with his own treatment of the first chapter in the Oedipus-myth. It is unnecessary to suppose that, when he composed the <title>Oedipus Tyrannus</title>, he contemplated an <title>Oedipus at Colonus.</title> As a drama, the former is complete in itself; it is only as an expression of the myth that it is supplemented by the latter.
</p>
<p>But why, it may be asked, should the King of Thebes have been connected by an ancient legend with this particular place in Attica? The primary link was a cult of the Eumenides at Colonus, which must have been still older than the association of Oedipus with that spot. This cult was itself connected, as the play indicates, with the existence at or near Colonus of a rift or cavernous opening in the ground, supposed to communicate with the under-world. The worship of the Eumenides at Colonus was identical in spirit with their worship at the Areiopagus, where a similar "descent to Hades" was the physical origin. The ancient rigour which required that bloodshed, whether deliberate or not, should be expiated by blood, was expressed by the older idea of the Erinyes, the implacable pursuers. The metamorphosis of the Erinyes into the Eumenides corresponds with a later and milder sense that bloodshed is compatible with varying degrees of guilt, ranging from premeditated murder to homicide in self-defence or by accident. Athenian legend claimed that this transformation of the Avengers took place in Attica, and that the institution of the court on the Areiopagus marked the moment. The claim was a mythical expression of qualities which history attests in the Athenian character, and of which the Athenians themselves were conscious as distinguishing them from other Greeks. It was Athenian to temper the letter of the law with considerations of equity (<foreign lang="greek">tou)pieike/s</foreign>); to use clemency; to feel compassion (<foreign lang="greek">ai)dw/s</foreign>) for unmerited misfortune; to shelter the oppressed; to restrict the sphere of violence; and to sacrifice,&mdash;where no other Greeks did,&mdash;at the altar of Persuasion<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="1" resp="RCJ"><bibl n="Isoc. 15.249">Isocr. or. 15 &sect; 249</bibl>.</note>. This character is signally impressed on the <title>Oedipus Coloneus</title>, and is personified in Theseus. The first session of the tribunal on the Hill of Ares was, in Attic story, the first occasion on which this humane character asserted itself against a hitherto inflexible precedent. Orestes slew his mother to avenge his father, whom she had slain; and the Erinyes demanded his blood. He is tried, and acquitted,&mdash;but not by the Erinyes; by Athene and her Athenian court. The Erinyes are the accusers, and Apollo is counsel for the prisoner. Then it is,&mdash; <emph>after</emph> the acquittal of Orestes,&mdash;that Athene's gentle pleading  effects a change in the defeated Avengers<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="1" resp="RCJ">In the recent performance of the <title>Eumenides</title> by members of the University of Cambridge a beautiful feature was the expression of this gradual change. Dr Stanford's music for the successive choral songs from <bibl n="Aesch. Eum. 778">v. 778</bibl> onwards interpreted each step of the transition from fierce rage to gentleness; and the acting of the Chorus was in unison with it throughout. We saw, and heard, the Erinyes becoming the Eumenides.</note>. They cease to be the Erinyes: they become the <soCalled>Benign</soCalled> or <soCalled>Majestic</soCalled> goddesses (<soCalled>Eumenides,</soCalled> <soCalled lang="en">Semnae</soCalled>), and are installed, as guardian deities of Attica, in a shrine beneath the Areiopagus. Henceforth they are symbols of the spirit which presided over the Attic criminal law of homicide (<foreign lang="greek">fo/nos</foreign>),&mdash;so remarkable for its combination of the unbending religious view, in which bloodshed was always a pollution, with a finely graduated scale of moral guilt, and with ample provision for the exercise of clemency.
</p>
<p>Oedipus was a passive Orestes,&mdash;like him, the instrument of an inherited destiny, but, unlike him, a sufferer, not a doer; for his involuntary acts, as he could justly say, were in reality sufferings rather than deeds. The Eumenides of Colonus could not refuse to admit his plea, commended to them, as it was, by Apollo. His was a typical case for the display of their gentler attributes. And, as Greek religion was prone to associate the cult of deities with that of mortals in whom their power had been shown, it was natural that the Eumenides and Oedipus should be honoured at the same place. A chapel which Pausanias saw at Colonus was dedicated jointly to Oedipus and Adrastus, &mdash;a further illustration of this point. For Adrastus was another example of inevitable destiny tempered by divine equity; he shared in the Argive disasters at Thebes; but he was personally innocent; and, alone of the chiefs, he survived.

<p><note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">The grave of Oedipus.</note></p>
<p>The grave of Oedipus in Attic ground is to form a perpetual safeguard for Attica against invaders. It is interesting to observe ancient traces of an exactly opposite feeling with regard to his resting-place. According to a Boeotian legend<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="2" resp="RCJ">Schol. on <bibl n="Soph. OC 91"><title>O. C.</title> 91</bibl>, quoting Lysimachus of Alexandria, in the 13th book of his <title lang="greek">*qhbai+ka/</title>. This Lysimachus, best known as the author of a prose <title lang="greek">*no/stoi</title>, lived probably <date value="-25">about 25 B.C.</date> See <bibl>M&uuml;ller, <title>Fragm. Hist.</title> III. 334</bibl>.</note>, Oedipus died at Thebes, and his friends wished to bury him  there; but the Thebans refused permission. His friends then carried the body to <q lang="en" direct="unspecified">"a place in Boeotia called Ceos,"</q> and there interred it. But <q lang="en" direct="unspecified">"certain misfortunes"</q> presently befell the people of Ceos, and they requested the friends of Oedipus to remove him. The friends next carried him to Eteonus, a place near the frontier between Boeotia and Attica, and buried him by night, without knowing that the ground which they chose for that purpose was sacred to Demeter. The matter having become known, the people of Eteonus sent to Delphi, and asked what they were to do. Apollo replied that they must not <q lang="en" direct="unspecified">"disturb the suppliant of the goddess"</q> (Demeter). Oedipus was therefore allowed to rest in peace, and the place of his burial was thenceforth called the <title>Oedipodeum.</title> We see how this Boeotian dread of his grave, as a bane to the place afflicted with it, answers to the older conception of the Erinyes; just as the Attic view, that his grave is a blessing, is in unison with the character of the Eumenides. It is only when the buried Oedipus has become associated with a <emph>benevolent</emph> Chthonian power,&mdash;namely, with Demeter,&mdash;that he ceases to be terrible.

<p>In the Attic view, <q lang="en" direct="unspecified">"the suppliant of the Benign Goddesses"</q> <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Oedipus and Attica.</note> at Colonus had not only become, like them, a beneficent agency, but had also been adopted into an Attic citizenship outlasting death. Sophocles expresses this feeling by the passage in which Theseus proclaims his formal acceptance of the new Athenian <bibl n="Soph. OC 631">(631)</bibl>.

So, too, the grave of the Argive Eurystheus in Attica was to be a blessing for the land (<bibl n="Eur. Her. 1032">Eur. <title>Her.</title> 1032</bibl>). Nor did this belief relate merely to the great heroes of mythology; a similar power was sometimes ascribed to the graves of historical men. Thus, as we learn from Aristeides, the tomb of Solon in Salamis was popularly regarded as securing the possession of that island to Athens.

The epithet Hippius belonged to the god Poseidon, as horse-creating and horse-taming (see <ref target="cl715" targOrder="U">on 715</ref>); it was given to this place because Poseidon Hippius was worshipped there, and served to distinguish this extramural Colonus from the Colonus Agoraeus, or "Market Hill," within the walls of Athens<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="3" resp="RCJ">In the district of Melit&egrave; (see map): cp. below, p. 5.</note>. In the absence of a distinguishing epithet, "Colonus" would usually mean Colonus Hippius; Thucydides calls it simply Colonus, and describes it as "a sanctuary (<foreign lang="greek">i(ero/n</foreign>) of Poseidon." His mention of it occurs in connection with the oligarchical conspiracy of <date value="-411">411 B.C.</date>, when Peisander and his associates chose Colonus, instead of the Pnyx, as the place of meeting for the Assembly which established the government of the Four Hundred. It is a fair, though not a necessary, inference from the historian's words that the assembly was held <emph>within</emph> the sacred precinct of Poseidon, with the double advantage  for the oligarchs of limiting the numbers and of precluding forcible interruption<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="1" resp="RCJ"><cit><bibl n="Thuc. 8.67">Thuc. 8. 67</bibl> <quote lang="greek">cune/klh|san th\n e)kklhsi/an e)s to\n *kolwno/n &lpar;e)/sti de\ i(ero\n *poseidw=nos e)/cw th=s po/lews, a)pe/xon stadi/ous ma/lista de/ka&rpar;</quote></cit>.&mdash;<bibl>Grote (VIII. 47)</bibl> renders <foreign lang="greek">i(ero/n</foreign> "temple," but it seems rather to denote the whole precinct sacred to Poseidon.  <bibl>Prof. Curtius (III. 438, Eng. tr.)</bibl> supposes the ecclesia to be held on the knoll of Colonus, near (and not within) the sanctuary,&mdash;understanding <foreign lang="greek">cune/klh|san</foreign> to denote an enclosure made for the occasion, partly to limit the numbers, partly "on account of the proximity of the enemy's army" (at Deceleia). Grote refers <foreign lang="greek">cune/klh|san</foreign> to some stratagem used by the oligarchs. I should rather refer it simply to the limit imposed by the <foreign lang="greek">i(ero/n</foreign> itself. Thucydides, as his words show, here identifies Colonus with the <foreign lang="greek">i(ero/n</foreign>. The temenos of Poseidon having been chosen as the place for the ecclesia, the <foreign lang="greek">peri/stia</foreign> would be carried round its boundary; after which no person outside of that lustral line would be considered as participating in the assembly. A choice of place which necessarily restricted the numbers might properly be described by <foreign lang="greek">cune/klh|san</foreign>.&mdash;Cp. <ref target="cl1491" targOrder="U">n. on 1491</ref>.</note>. The altar of Poseidon in this precinct is not visible to the spectators of our play, but is supposed to be near. When Pausanias visited Colonus (<date value="180">c. 180 A.D.</date>), he saw an altar of Poseidon Hippius and Athene Hippia. A grove and a temple of Poseidon had formerly existed there, but had perished long before the date of his visit. He found, too, that divine honours were paid at Colonus to Peirithous and Theseus, to Oedipus and Adrastus: there were perhaps two shrines or chapels (<foreign lang="greek">h(rw=|a</foreign>), one for each pair of heroes<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="2" resp="RCJ">His use of the singular is ambiguous, owing to its place in the sentence: <cit><quote lang="greek">h(rw=|on de\ *peiri/qou kai\ *qhse/ws *oi)di/podo/s te kai\ *)adra/stou</quote> <bibl n="Paus. 1.30.4">(I. 30. 4)</bibl></cit>.</note>. He does not mention the grove of the Eumenides, which, like that of Poseidon, had doubtless been destroyed at an earlier period.

<p>About a quarter of a mile N.E.N. of the Colonus Hippius <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Demeter Euchlo&uuml;s.</note> rises a second mound, identified by E.

When Oedipus stood at the spot where he finally disappeared, this hill was "in full view" (<foreign lang="greek">proso/yios</foreign>). Traces of an ancient building exist at its southern edge. Similar traces exist at the N.W. edge of the Colonus Hippius. If, as is likely, these ancient buildings were connected with religious purposes, it is possible that the specially sacred region of the ancient Colonus lay between the two mounds<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="3" resp="RCJ"><p>The present aspect of Colonus is thus described by an accomplished scholar, <bibl>Mr George Wotherspoon (Longmans' Magazine, Feb. 1884)</bibl>:

<p>The "stone-capt mound" is the Colonus Hippius, on which are the monuments of Otfried M&uuml;ller and Lenormant. If Colonus itself has thus lost its ancient charms, at least the views from it in every direction are very fine; especially so is the view of the Acropolis.</p>

<p>The grove of the Eumenides may have been on the N. <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Probable site of the grove.</note> or N.E. side of the Colonus Hippius. But the only condition  fixed by the play fails to be precise, viz. that a road, passing by Colonus to Athens, skirted the grove,&mdash;the inner or most sacred part of the grove being on the side furthest from the road. The <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">A suggestion.</note>roads marked on our map are the ancient roads<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="1" resp="RCJ">On these, see the letter-press by Prof. Curtius to the <bibl><title lang="de">Atlas von Athen,</title> pp. 14 f</bibl>.</note>.

There is no reason why the wandering Oedipus should not be conceived as entering Attica from the N.W.; <foreign lang="la">i.e.</foreign>, as having passed into the Attic plain round the N. end of Aegaleos. And, in that case, the road in question might well represent the route by which Sophocles, familiar with the local details of Colonus in his own day, imagined Oedipus as arriving. Then Oedipus, moving towards Athens, would have the grove of the Eumenides on his right hand<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="2" resp="RCJ">It is scarcely necessary to say that no objection, or topographical inference of any kind, can be drawn from the conventional arrangement of the Greek stage by which Oedipus (as coming from the country) would enter on the spectator's left, and therefore have the scenic grove on his left.</note>, if, as we were supposing, this grove was on the N. side of the Colonus Hippius. The part of the grove furthest from him (<cit><quote lang="greek">tou)kei=qen a)/lsous</quote> <bibl n="Soph.

If the scholiast is right as to the situation of the temple, Eupolis used <foreign lang="greek">po/lews</foreign> in the sense of "acropolis," as Athenians still used it in the time of <bibl n="Thuc. 2.15">Thucydides (2. 15)</bibl>.</note>. Are we to suppose, then, that Sophocles alludes to the chasm at the Areiopagus, and that "the hill of Demeter Euchlo&uuml;s" means this shrine of Demeter Chlo&euml; on the slope of the Acropolis? This view<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="2" resp="RCJ">It is beautifully and persuasively stated in <bibl>Wordsworth's <title>Athens and Attica</title>, ch. XXX. (p. 203, 4th ed.)</bibl>. The author holds that the poet, embarrassed by the rival claims of the Areiopagus and Colonus, intended to suggest the former without definitely excluding the latter.</note>&mdash;which the coincidence might reasonably suggest&mdash;seems to present insuperable difficulties. At <bibl n="Soph. OC 643">v. 643</bibl> Theseus asks Oedipus whether he will come to Athens or stay at Colonus. He replies that he will stay at Colonus, because it is the scene appointed for his victory over his foes (<bibl n="Soph. OC 646">646</bibl>). But the victory was to take place at his grave (<bibl n="Soph. OC 411">411</bibl>); which the poet therefore supposed to be at or near Colonus,&mdash;not at Athens. If, then, in the time of Sophocles an Areiopagus-legend already claimed the grave of Oedipus,  the poet disregarded it. And, when the grave was to be associated with Colonus, it would be strange to send Oedipus so far for the purpose of vanishing at the Areiopagus. The brevity of the choral ode which separates the final exit of Oedipus (<bibl n="Soph. OC 1555">1555</bibl>) from the entrance of the Messenger (<bibl n="Soph. OC 1579">1579</bibl>) implies, as does the whole context, that Oedipus passed away somewhere near the grove&mdash;not at a distance of more than a mile and a half, as the other theory requires. Then the phrase <cit><quote lang="greek">*eu)xlo/ou *dh/mhtros pa/gos</quote> <bibl n="Soph.

It did not occur to him that the Colonus-myth as to the grave could be harmonised with the Areiopagus-myth. Sophocles adopts the Colonus-myth unreservedly; nor can I believe that he intended, by any deliberate vagueness, to leave his hearers free to think of the Areiopagus. The chasm called the <foreign lang="greek">katarra/kths o)do/s</foreign> must be imagined, then, as not very distant from the grove. No such chasm is visible at the present day in the neighbourhood of Colonus. But this fact is insufficient to prove that no appearance of the kind can have existed there in antiquity<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="2" resp="RCJ">Prof. T. McK. Hughes, Woodwardian Professor of Geology in the University of Cambridge, kindly permits me to quote his answer to a question of mine on this point. His remarks refer to the general conditions of such phenomena in Greece at large, and must be taken as subject to the possibility that special conditions in the neighbourhood of Colonus may be adverse to the processes described; though I am not aware of any reason for thinking that such is the case. <quote lang="en">"It is quite possible that a chasm, such as is common in the limestone rocks of Greece, might become first choked, so as no longer to allow the passage of the winter's flood, and then overgrown and levelled, so that there might be no trace of it visible on the surface. The water from the high ground during winter rains rushes down the slopes until it reaches the jointed limestone rock. It filters slowly at first into the fissures. But the water, especially when it contains (as most surface water does) a little acid, dissolves the sides of the fissure, and soon admits sand and pebbles, the mechanical action of which hurries on the work of opening out a great chasm, which swallows up the winter's torrent, and becomes a katavothron.  But during the summer no water runs in, and, even without an earthquake shock, such a chasm may get choked. The waters which cannot find their way through then stand in holes, and deposit their mud. There would be for some time a pond above, but that would at last get filled, and all trace of the chasm be lost."</quote></note>.

The poet's conception appears to have been of this kind. At the moment when Oedipus passed away, in the mystic vision which left Theseus dazzled, it was revealed to the king of Athens where the mortal remains of Oedipus would be found. The soul of Oedipus went down to Hades, whether ushered by a conducting god, or miraculously drawn to the embrace of the spirits below (<bibl n="Soph.

As in the <title>Iliad</title> the corpse of Sarpedon is borne from Troy to Lycia by <quote lang="en">"the twin-brothers, Sleep and Death,"</quote> so divine hands were to minister here.

This supposition is, however, extremely improbable, and derives no support from any stage arrangements  which the opening scene implies.  Rather the "Brazen Threshold" of <bibl n="Soph. OC 57">v. 57</bibl> was a name derived from the particular spot which is called the "sheer threshold," and applied in a larger sense to the immediately adjacent region, including the ground on which the grove stood. The epithet "brazen" properly belonged to the actual chasm or "threshold," &mdash; the notion being that a flight of brazen steps connected the upper world with the Homeric "brazen threshold" of Hades. In its larger application to the neighbouring ground, "brazen" was a poetical equivalent for "rocky," and this ground was called the "stay" or "support" (<foreign lang="greek">e)/reisma</foreign>) of Athens, partly in the physical sense of "firm basis," partly also with the notion that the land had a safeguard in the benevolence of those powers to whose nether realm the "threshold" led.

<p><note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Evidence from Istros.</note>This view is more than a conjecture; it can be supported by ancient authority. Istros, a native of Cyrene, was first the slave, then the disciple and friend, of the Alexandrian poet Callimachus; he lived, then, <date value="-240">about 240 B.C.</date>, or less than 170 years after <date value="-406">the death of Sophocles</date><note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="1" resp="RCJ"><bibl>M&uuml;ller, <title>Fragm. Hist.</title> I., lxxxv., 418</bibl>.</note>. He is reckoned among the authors of <title>Atthides</title>, having written, among other things, a work entitled <title lang="greek">*)attika/</title>, in at least sixteen books. In the later Alexandrian age he was one of the chief authorities on Attic topography; and he is quoted six times in the ancient scholia on the <title>Oedipus Coloneus.</title> One of these quotations has not (so far as I know) been noticed in its bearing on the point now under discussion; it does not occur in the scholium on <bibl n="Soph. OC 57">v. 57</bibl>, but on <bibl n="Soph. OC 1059">1059</bibl>, in connection with another subject ("the snowy rock"). It would appear that in the first book of his <title lang="greek">*)attika/</title> Istros sketched an itinerary of Attica, marking off certain stages or distances. Along with some other words, the scholiast quotes these:&mdash;<quote lang="greek">a)po\ de\ tou/tou e(/ws *kolwnou= para\ to\n *xalkou=n prosagoreuo/menon: o(/qen pro\s to\n *khfiso\n e(/ws th=s mustikh=s ei)so/dou ei)s *)eleusi=na</quote>.  We do not know to what <foreign lang="greek">a)po\ tou/tou</foreign> referred: but the context is clear. Two distances are here indicated: (1) one is from the point meant by <foreign lang="greek">tou=to</foreign>, "<emph>along the Brazen Threshold, as it is called</emph>," to Colonus: (2) the second is from Colonus "in the direction of the Cephisus, as far as the road by which the Initiated approach Eleusis," &mdash; <foreign lang="la">i.e.</foreign>, as far  as the point at which the Sacred Way crosses the Cephisus (see map). A third stage is then introduced by the words, <foreign lang="greek">a)po\ tau/ths de\</foreign> (<foreign lang="la">sc.</foreign> <foreign lang="greek">th=s ei)so/dou</foreign>) <foreign lang="greek">badizo/ntwn ei)s *)eleusi=na</foreign>, etc. Thus the course of the second stage is from N.E. to S.W.; and the third stage continues the progress westward. Hence it would be natural to infer that the unknown point meant by <foreign lang="greek">tou=to</foreign>, from which one set out "along the Brazen Threshold," was somewhere to the E. or N.E. of Colonus. At any rate, wherever that point was, the question with which we are chiefly concerned is settled by this passage. The "Brazen Threshold" was not merely the name of a definite spot. It was the name given to a whole strip of ground, or region, "along which" the wayfarer proceeded to Colonus. And this perfectly agrees with the manner in which Sophocles refers to it (<bibl n="Soph. OC 57">v. 57</bibl>).

<p>In order to understand the opening part of the play (as <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Stage arrangements in the opening scene.</note> far as <bibl n="Soph. OC 201">v. 201</bibl>), it is necessary to form some distinct notion of the stage arrangements.  It is of comparatively little moment that we cannot pretend to say exactly how far the aids of scenery and carpentry were actually employed when the play was first produced at Athens.  Without knowing this, we can still make out all that is needful for a clear comprehension of the text.  First, it is evident that the back-scene (the palace-front of so many plays) must here have been supposed to represent a landscape of some sort,&mdash;whether the acropolis of Athens was shown in the distance, or not. Secondly, the sacred grove on the stage must have been so contrived that Oedipus could retire into its covert, and then show himself <bibl n="Soph. OC 138">(138)</bibl> as if in an opening or glade, along which Antigone gradually leads him until he is beyond the precinct.  If one of the doors in the back-scene had been used for the exit of Oedipus into the grove, then it would at least have been necessary to show, within the door, a tolerably deep vista.  It seems more likely that the doors of the back-scene were not used at all in this play.  I give a diagram to show how the action as far as <bibl n="Soph. OC 201">v. 201</bibl> might be managed<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="1" resp="RCJ">I was glad to find that the view expressed by this diagram approved itself to a critic who is peculiarly well qualified to judge, &mdash; Mr J.

<!-- There is a diagram here. --></p>
<p>Antigone leads in her blind father on the spectators' left. She places him on a seat of natural rock (the "1st seat" in the diagram). This rock is just within the bounds of the grove; which evidently was not surrounded by a fence of any kind, ingress and egress being free. When the Chorus approach, Antigone and her father hide in the grove, following the left of the two dotted lines <bibl n="Soph. OC 113">(113)</bibl>.  When Oedipus discloses himself to the Chorus <bibl n="Soph. OC 138">(138)</bibl>, he is well within the grove. Assured of safety, he is gradually led forward by Antigone <bibl n="Soph. OC 173">(173-191)</bibl>, along the right-hand dotted line. At the limit of the grove, in this part, there is a low ledge of natural rock, forming a sort of threshold. When he has set foot on this ledge of rock,&mdash;being now just outside the grove,&mdash;he is told to halt <bibl n="Soph. OC 192">(192)</bibl>. A low seat of natural rock,&mdash;the outer edge (<foreign lang="greek">a)/krou</foreign>) of the rocky threshold,&mdash; is now close to him. He has only to take a step sideways (<foreign lang="greek">le/xrios</foreign>) to reach it. Guided by Antigone, he moves to it, and she places him on it (the "2nd seat" in the diagram:  <bibl n="Soph. OC 201">v. 201</bibl>).

<div2 id="cis17" type="section" n="17">
<p><note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">The Attic plays of Euripides.</note></p>
<p>Not only the local colour but the Athenian sentiment of the <title>Coloneus</title> naturally suggests a comparison, or a contrast, with some plays of Euripides. It may be said that the especially Attic plays of the latter fall under two classes. First, there are the pieces in which he indirectly links his fable with the origin of Attic institutions, religious or civil, though the action does not pass in Attica; thus the <title>Ion</title>,&mdash;of which the scene is at Delphi,&mdash; bears on the origin of the Attic tribes; the <title>Iphigenia in Tauris</title> refers to the cult of Artemis as practised in Attica at Halae and  Brauron. Then there are the more directly Athenian plays,&mdash; the <title>Supplices</title>, where Theseus takes the part of the Argive king Adrastus, and compels the Thebans to allow the burial of the Argives slain at Thebes; the <title>Heracleidae</title>, where the son of Theseus protects the children of Heracles,&mdash;as Theseus himself, in the <title>Hercules Furens</title> (of which the scene is at Thebes), had induced their father to seek an asylum at Athens. If the Attic elements in the <title>Oedipus Coloneus</title> are compared with those of the plays just mentioned, the difference is easily felt. In the first of the two Euripidean groups, the tone of the Attic traits is antiquarian; in the second, it tends to be political,&mdash;<foreign lang="la">i.e.</foreign>, we meet with allusions, more or less palpable, to the relations of Athens with Argos or with Thebes at certain moments of the Peloponnesian war. The <title>Oedipus Coloneus</title> has many references to local usages,&mdash;in particular, the minute description of the rites observed in the grove of the Eumenides; it is a reflex of contemporary Attic life, in so far as it is a faithful expression of qualities which actually distinguished the Athens of Sophocles in public action, at home and abroad. But the poet is an artist working in a purely ideal spirit; and the proof of his complete success is the unobtrusive harmony of the local touches with all the rest. In <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">The <title>Eumenides.</title></note> this respect the <title>Oedipus Coloneus</title> might properly be compared with the <title>Eumenides</title>,&mdash;with which it has the further affinity of subject already noticed above. Yet there is a difference. Contemporary events affecting the Areiopagus were vividly present to the mind of Aeschylus. He had a political sympathy, if not a political purpose, which might easily have marred the ideal beauty of a lesser poet's creation. Prudently bold, he deprived it of all power to do this by the direct simplicity with which he expressed it (<bibl n="Aesch. Eum. 693"><title>Eum.</title> 693-701</bibl>). The <title>Oedipus Coloneus</title> contains perhaps one verse in which we might surmise that the poet was thinking of his own days <bibl n="Soph. OC 1537">(1537)</bibl>; but it does not contain a word which could be interpreted as directly alluding to them.

The ancient belief is expressed by the well-known story for which Cicero is our earliest authority:&mdash;

<quote lang="en"><p>"Sophocles wrote tragedies to extreme old age; and as, owing to this pursuit, he was thought to neglect his property, he was brought by his sons before a court of law, in order that the judges might declare him incapable of managing his affairs,&mdash;as Roman law withdraws the control of an estate from the incompetent head of a family. Then, they say, the old man recited to the judges the play on which he was engaged, and which he had last written,&mdash;the <title>Oedipus Coloneus;</title> and asked whether that poem was suggestive of imbecility.

As to the recitation, a jury of some hundreds of citizens in an Athenian law-court formed a body to which such a <foreign lang="fr">coup de th&eacute;&acirc;tre</foreign> could  be addressed with great effect.  The general spirit of Greek forensic oratory makes it quite intelligible that a celebrated dramatist should have vindicated his sanity in the manner supposed. The true ground for doubt is of another kind. It <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Its probable origin.</note> appears that an arraignment of the aged Sophocles, by his son Iophon, before a court of his clansmen (phratores), had furnished a scene to a contemporary comedy<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="1" resp="RCJ">The passage which shows this is in the anonymous <foreign lang="greek">*bi/os</foreign>; &mdash; <quote lang="greek">fe/retai de\ kai\ para\ polloi=s h( pro\s to\n ui(o\n *)iofw=nta genome/nh au)tw=| di/kh pote/. e)/xwn ga\r e)k me\n *nikostra/ths *)iofw=nta, e)k de\ *qew/ridos *sikuwni/as *)ari/stwna, to\n e)k tou/tou geno/menon pai=da *sofokle/a ple/on e)/stergen. kai/ pote e)n dra/mati ei)sh/gage to\n *)iofw=nta au)tw=| fqonou=nta kai\ pro\s tou\s fra/toras e)gkalou=nta tw=| patri\ w(s u(po\ gh/rws parafronou=nti: oi( de\ tw=| *)iofw=nti e)peti/mhsan. *sa/turos de/ fhsin au)to\n ei)pei=n: ei) me/n ei)mi *sofoklh=s, ou) parafronw=: ei) de\ parafronw=, ou)k ei)mi\ *sofoklh=s: kai\ to/te to\n *oi)di/poda a)nagnw=nai</quote>. In the sentence, <foreign lang="greek">kai/ pote...ei)sh/gage</foreign>, the name of a comic poet, who was the subject to <foreign lang="greek">ei)sh/gage</foreign>, has evidently been lost. Some would supply <foreign lang="greek">*leu/kwn</foreign>, one of whose plays was entitled <title lang="greek">*fra/tores</title>. Hermann conjectured, <foreign lang="greek">kai/ pote *)aristofa/nhs e)n *dra/masin</foreign>,&mdash;Aristophanes having written a play called <title lang="greek">*dra/mata</title>, or rather two, unless the <title lang="greek">*dra/mata h)\ *ke/ntauros</title> and <title lang="greek">*dra/mata h)\ *ni/obos</title> were only different editions of the same.  Whoever the comic poet was, his purpose towards Sophocles was benevolent, as the phratores censured Iophon. This tone, at least, is quite consistent with the conjecture that the poet was Aristophanes (cp. <bibl n="Aristoph. Frogs 79"><title>Ran.</title> 79</bibl>).  Just after the death of Sophocles, Phrynichus wrote of him as one whose happiness had been unclouded to the very end&mdash;<foreign lang="greek">kalw=s d' e)teleu/ths), ou)de\n u(pomei/nas kako/n</foreign>. There is some force in Schneidewin's remark that this would be strange if the poet's last days had been troubled by such a scandal as the supposed trial.</note>; and it is highly probable that the comic poet's invention&mdash;founded possibly on gossip about differences between Sophocles and his sons &mdash;was the origin of the story. This inference is slightly confirmed by the words which, according to one account, Sophocles used in the law-court: <quote lang="greek">ei) me/n ei)mi *sofoklh=s, ou) parafronw=: ei) de\ parafronw=, ou)k ei)mi\ *sofoklh=s</quote>. That has the ring of the Old Comedy<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="2" resp="RCJ">I need scarcely point out how easily the words could be made into a pair of comic trimeters, <foreign lang="la">e.g.</foreign>

This would fit into a burlesque forensic speech, in the style of the new rhetoric, which the comedy may have put into the mouth of Sophocles. As though, in a modern comedy, the pedagogue should say,&mdash;<q lang="en" direct="unspecified">"If I am Doctor X., I am not fallible; if I am fallible, I am not Doctor X."</q></note>. The words are quoted in the anonymous Life of Sophocles as being recorded by Satyrus, a Peripatetic who lived <date value="-200">about 200 B.C.</date>, and left a collection of biographies.  His work appears to have been of a superficial character, and uncritical<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="1" resp="RCJ">The literary vestiges of this Satyrus will be found in <bibl>M&uuml;ller, <title>Fragm. Hist.</title> III. 159 ff</bibl>.</note>. The incident of the trial, as he found it in a comedy of the time of Sophocles, would doubtless have found easy acceptance at his hands.

<p><note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Internal evidence &mdash;supposed political bearings.</note></p>
<p>It must now be asked how far the internal evidence of the play supports the belief that it belongs to the poet's latest years. Lachmann, maintaining the singular view that the <title>Oedipus Coloneus</title> was <quote lang="en">"political through and through"</quote> (<quote lang="de">"durch und durch politisch"</quote>), held that it was composed just before the beginning of the Peloponnesian war, with the purpose of kindling Athenian patriotism. Another conjecture is that the play was prepared for the Great Dionysia of <date value="-411">411 B.C.</date>, just after the Government of Four Hundred had been established by the assembly held at Colonus; that Colonus Hippius may have been "in some special sense the Knights' Quarter"; that hence the play would commend itself to a class of men among whom the new oligarchy had found most of its adherents; and that, after the fall of the Four Hundred, political considerations prevented a reproduction of the play, until, after the poet's death, it was revived in <date value="-402">402 B.C.</date><note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="2" resp="RCJ"><bibl>Prof. L. Campbell, <title>Sophocles</title>, vol. I. 276 ff</bibl>.</note> This is an ingenious view, but not (to my apprehension) a probable one.  That the play would have been especially popular with the Athenian Knights need not be doubted; but it is another thing to suppose that the composition of the play had regard to their political sympathies in <date value="-411">411 B.C.</date>  In a time of public excitement any drama bearing on the past of one's country is pretty sure to furnish some words that will seem fraught with a present meaning. We may grant that such a meaning would sometimes, perhaps, have been found by an Athenian spectator of this play, and also that the poet's mind, when he wrote it, was not insensible to the influence of contemporary events. But it seems not the less true to affirm that, from the first verse to the last, in great things and in small, the play is purely a work of ideal art.

<p><note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Character of the composition.</note></p>
<p>Another species of internal evidence has been sought in the character of the dramatic composition. It has been held  that the <title>Oedipus Coloneus</title> shares certain traits with the <title>Philoctetes</title>, the other play which tradition assigns to the latest years of Sophocles. One such trait is the larger scope given to scenic effects which appeal to the eye and the ear,&mdash;such as the pitiable garb of Oedipus, the personal violence of Creon, the scenery of Colonus, the thunder-storm. Another is the change from a severer type of tragedy, which concentrates the interest on a single issue&mdash;as in the <title>Tyrannus</title>&mdash;to a type which admits the relief of secondary interests,&mdash;such as the cult at Colonus, the rescue of the maidens, the glory of Athens, the fortunes of Thebes. A third trait of similar significance has been recognised in the contemplative tendency of the play, which leaves the spectator at leisure to meditate on questions other than those which are solved by a stroke of dramatic action,&mdash;such as the religious and the moral aspects of the hero's acts, or the probable effect of his pleas on the Athenian mind<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="1" resp="RCJ">See <bibl>Campbell, I. 259 ff.</bibl></note>. Akin to this tendency is the choice of subjects like those of the <title>Coloneus</title> and the <title>Philoctetes</title>, which end with a reconciliation, not with a disaster. And here there is an analogy with some of the latest of Shakspeare's plays,&mdash;the <title>Winter's Tale</title>, <title>Tempest</title>, and <title>Cymbeline</title>, &mdash;which end, as Prof. Dowden says, with <quote lang="en">"a resolution of the dissonance, a reconciliation."</quote><note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="2" resp="RCJ"><bibl><title>Shakspere&mdash;His Mind and Art</title>, p. 406.</bibl></note>
</p>
<p>It may at once be conceded that the traits above mentioned are present in the <title>Coloneus</title>, and that they are among those which distinguish it from the <title>Tyrannus.</title> The <title>Coloneus</title> is indeed more picturesque, more tolerant of a distributed interest, more meditative; and its end is peace. But it is less easy to decide how far these traits are due to the subject itself, and how far they can safely be regarded as distinctive of the poet's latest period. Let us suppose for a moment that external evidence had assigned the <title>Coloneus</title> to the earlier years of Sophocles. It would not then, perhaps, seem less reasonable to suggest that these same traits are characteristic of youth. Here, it might be said, we find the openness of a youthful imagination to impressions of the senses; its preference of variety to intensity, in the absence of that matured and virile sternness of dramatic purpose which can  concentrate the thoughts on a single issue; its affinity to such themes as temper the darker view of human destiny with some gladness and some hope. In saying this, I do not mean to suggest that the latter view of the traits in question is actually more correct than the former, but merely to illustrate the facility with which considerations of this nature can be turned to the support of opposite hypotheses.
</p>
<p><note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Rhetoric.</note>Another feature of the play which has been supposed to indicate the <dateRange from="-415" to="-400">close of the fifth century B.C.</dateRange> is the prominence of the rhetorical element in certain places, especially in the scenes with Creon and Polyneices. We should recollect, however, that the <title>Ajax</title> is generally allowed to be one of the earlier plays, and that the scenes there between Teucer and the Atreidae show the taste for rhetorical discussion quite as strongly as any part of the <title>Coloneus.</title> Rhetoric should be distinguished from rhetorical dialectic. Subtleties of the kind which appear in some plays of Euripides are really marks of date, as showing new tendencies of thought. But the natural rhetoric of debate, such as we find it in the <title>Ajax</title> and the <title>Coloneus</title>, was as congenial to Greeks in the days of Homer as in the days of Protagoras.

<p><note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Conclusion.</note></p>
<p>Our conclusion may be as follows. There is no reason to question the external evidence which refers the <title>Oedipus Coloneus</title> to <dateRange from="-410" to="-406">the latest years of Sophocles</dateRange>. But no corroboration of it can be derived from the internal evidence, except in one general aspect and one detail,&mdash;viz. the choice of an Attic subject, and the employment of a fourth actor. The Attic plays of Euripides, mentioned above, belong to the latter part of the Peloponnesian war, which naturally tended to a concentration of home sympathies. An Attic theme was the most interesting that a dramatist could choose; and he was doing a good work, if, by recalling the past glories of Athens, he could inspire new courage in her sons. If Attica was to furnish a subject, the author of the <title>Oedipus Tyrannus</title> had no need to look beyond his native Colonus; and it is conceivable that this general influence of the time should have decided the choice. In three scenes of the play, four actors are on the stage together. This innovation may be allowed as indicating the latest period of Sophocles<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="1" resp="RCJ">A discussion of this point will be found below, in the note on the Dramatis Personae, p. 7.</note>.

<p>Prologue. Oedipus has sat down to rest, when a man of the place warns him that he is on holy ground. It is the grove of the Eumenides. At that word, Oedipus knows that he has found his destined goal; and, when the stranger has gone to summon the men of Colonus, invokes the goddesses.&mdash;Steps approach; Oedipus and his daughter hide themselves in the grove.

Our pointing is better than <foreign lang="greek">w(s pro\s ti/; l. h)\ k. molei=n</foreign>; The query turns more on the motive of the appeal than on a sharp contrast between its possible forms. <foreign lang="greek">le/cwn</foreign> should not be joined with <foreign lang="greek">molei=n</foreign> (<quote lang="en">"<emph>bid</emph> him come,"</quote> Blaydes).
</p>
<p>The reading and explanation of the verse hinge on the question whether <foreign lang="greek">w(s</foreign> (1) belongs to <foreign lang="greek">pro\s ti/</foreign>, = "with what view?" or (2) is final, = "in order that."  Now (1) is strongly supported by two other places of Soph., in each of which this formula stands, as here, at the beginning of a question: <cit><bibl n="Soph. OT 1174"><title>O. T.</title> 1174</bibl> <quote lang="greek">*o*i. <emph>w(s pro\s ti/</emph> xrei/as;</quote></cit>  <cit><bibl n="Soph.

The oracle about final rest had been given to Oed. in his youth (see on <ref target="cl87" targOrder="U">87</ref>); the oracle about his grave has only just been received at Thebes <bibl n="Soph.

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">e)/rws</lemma>, desire <bibl n="Soph. OC 436">(436)</bibl>, is a necessary and a certain correction.

<p>Oedipus took <cit><quote lang="greek">e)n soi/</quote> <bibl n="Soph. OC 392">(392)</bibl></cit> to mean that the welfare of Thebes depended on his presence there.

Oedipus does not see the force of this answer: he still infers (from <foreign lang="greek">qano/nta</foreign> in <bibl n="Soph.

"<emph>So</emph>" &mdash; pursues the daughter <bibl n="Soph. OC 404">(404)</bibl> &mdash; "they mean to keep you within their grasp."  A new suspicion flashes on him. "They will <emph>bury</emph> me at Thebes?" "It cannot be." That is enough. He will never give himself into their hands. &mdash; Remark that he was supposing Apollo's former decree <bibl n="Soph.

The Chorus have known all along that Oed. had married Iocasta, and also that he was the father of the girls (cp. 170, 322); but they are supposed to learn now for the first time that Iocasta was their mother. In the earlier versions of the Oedipus-myth (as in the <title>Odyssey</title>) Iocasta bears no issue to Oed.; his children are borne by a second wife, Euryganeia. The Attic poets seem first to have changed this (see Introd. to <bibl n="Soph. OT"><title>O. T.</title></bibl> p. xv). The Chorus would say: <quote lang="en">"Thine, then, they are by a double tie, at once as children and...as <emph>sisters?</emph>"</quote> but Oed. takes out of their mouths the second name which they shrink from uttering, and utters it himself with terrible emphasis.

<p> Kayser's <foreign lang="greek">a)/nac, xrh/|zousi</foreign> (for <foreign lang="greek">a)nagka/zousi</foreign>) is exactly what the sense requires, and is fairly near to the MS. reading, while the latter is (I think) certainly corrupt. The verse must not be considered alone, but in close connection with 590, and with the whole context. It has been rendered:&mdash;(1) <quote lang="en">"They are for compelling (<emph>my protectors</emph>) to convey me to Thebes."</quote> But the ellipse of <quote lang="greek">tina/</quote> before <quote lang="greek">komi/zein</quote> is intolerable. And the protectors could not be required to do more than surrender him. Therefore it is no cure to propose <foreign lang="greek">ei)/ s)</foreign> (for <quote lang="greek">kei=s)</quote>) <quote lang="greek">a)nagka/sousi/ me</quote>. To read <quote lang="greek">se</quote> for <quote lang="greek">me</quote> merely shifts the first difficulty, and leaves the second. (2) <quote lang="en">"They are for putting constraint on me, so as to carry (me) to Thebes."</quote> Such an epexegesis by the <emph>act.</emph> infin. is impossible here. Who could write <quote lang="greek">a)nagka/zei se a)/gein e)kei=se</quote>, meaning, <quote lang="en">"he is forcing thee, so as to take (thee) thither"</quote>? (3) <quote lang="greek">komi/zein</quote> has been taken as=<quote lang="en">"to return,"</quote>=<quote lang="greek">komi/zesqai</quote>. This needs no comment. We want either: (1) instead of <foreign lang="greek">komi/zein</foreign>, a word=<quote lang="en">"<emph>to return</emph>"</quote>; but <quote lang="greek">katelqei=n</quote> is very unlikely, and no other substitute is obvious: or (2) instead of <foreign lang="greek">a)nagka/zousi</foreign>, a word = <quote lang="en">"they <emph>wish</emph>, <emph>seek.</emph>"</quote> That the fault lies in <quote lang="greek">a)nagka/zousi</quote> is very strongly suggested by 590, where L has <foreign lang="greek">a)ll' ei) qe/lont' a)/n g)</foreign>, evidently corrupted, by dittographia of <quote lang="greek">g)</quote>, from <quote lang="greek">a)ll' ei) qe/lonta/ g)</quote>, which L2 has. This gives a clear and fitting sense, if in 589 we read <foreign lang="greek">a)/nac, xrh/|zousi/ me</foreign>. All the trouble, for the MSS. and for the edd., has arisen from <quote lang="greek">a)nagka/zousi</quote>. Hence (1) Goebel, <foreign lang="greek">a)ll' ou) qelo/ntwn</foreign>, <quote lang="en">"but if they do not wish thee"</quote> (<quote lang="greek">feu/gein</quote>): (2) Reisig, <foreign lang="greek">a)ll' ei) qe/lonta/s g)</foreign>, <quote lang="en">"but what if it be not seemly for thee to shun them when willing (to receive thee)?"</quote> Both these are forced. Campbell supplies <quote lang="greek">ei) bou/lointo komi/zein</quote> to explain <quote lang="greek">qe/lonta</quote>, keeping L's <quote lang="greek">qe/lont' a)/n</quote>: but <quote lang="greek">a)/n</quote> can stand with a partic. only when the latter is equiv. to an apodosis, as it is in 761. So far as the tense of <quote lang="greek">a)nagka/zousi</quote> is concerned, a change to the <emph>fut.</emph> is no gain: it is the pres. of tendency or intention. But the whole mention of <emph>compulsion or violence</emph> is premature in 589. Oed. leads very gently up to the disclosure of his sons' unnatural conduct (599).

<p>The first strophe and antistrophe (668&mdash;680=681 &mdash;693) praise Colonus: the second (694 &mdash;706=707&mdash;719) praise Attica.

The equestrian fame of Colonus suggests the Attic breed of horses, and this, in turn, suggests Poseidon's other gift to Athens,&mdash;the empire of the sea (second antistrophe).

<p>If <foreign lang="greek">oi)=da</foreign> is right (as it seems to be), <foreign lang="greek">mh/</foreign> can hardly be explained otherwise than by emphasis, <foreign lang="la">i.e.</foreign> by the <emph>strong assurance</emph> which the speaker expresses. But what form should the partic. have? (1) With the MS. <foreign lang="greek">pei/qwn</foreign>, the sense is: <quote lang="en">"However, I am assured that I am not persuading you of this,&mdash;go!"</quote> In <cit><bibl n="Soph.

In 1121 there is another: <quote lang="greek">e)pi/stamai ga\r th/nde... te/ryin par' a)/llou <emph>mhdeno\s</emph> pefasme/nhn</quote>. Here, however, <quote lang="greek">oi(=da <emph>mh\</emph> pei/qwn</quote> is so far stranger, that the emphasis appears less appropriate in stating the speaker's consciousness <emph>of what he himself is doing.</emph> (2) The <foreign lang="la">v.l.</foreign> <foreign lang="greek">pei/qont)</foreign>, extant in at least one MS. (F), removes this objection. <quote lang="en">"However, I am assured <emph>that you are not persuading</emph> (either the Athenians or me, cp. 803)&mdash;go!"</quote> (3) <foreign lang="greek">pei/swn</foreign> would be liable to the same remark as <quote lang="greek">pei/qwn</quote>. (4) <foreign lang="greek">pei/sont)</foreign> would complete the parallelism with 656, but is not <emph>required</emph> by the <quote lang="en">"strong assurance"</quote> view, which applies to past (1121) or present as well as to future.&mdash;Another view is that <foreign lang="greek">mh/</foreign> gives a <emph>quasi-imperative</emph> force: <quote lang="en">"I know that you <emph>shan't</emph> persuade."</quote> This might apply to 656. Here it is much more difficult, esp. if we do <emph>not</emph> adopt <quote lang="greek">pei/sont)</quote>: in 1121 it fails.

<p>With <quote lang="greek">i)/sqi &hellip; me</quote> for <quote lang="greek">oi)=da...de</quote> the imper. would explain <foreign lang="greek">mh/</foreign> (cp. on <ref target="cl78" targOrder="U">78</ref>): and we may note that in <bibl n="Soph.

But the context confirms <foreign lang="greek">oi)=da</foreign>.</p>
<p>In later Greek <quote lang="greek">mh/</quote> with partic., in regard to <emph>fact</emph>, was common, as Luc. <title>Dial.

The two roads meant are probably:&mdash;(1) A road leading from Colonus, north of the Sacred Way, to the pass now called Daphn&egrave;, a depression in the range of Mount Aegaleos through which the Sacred Way issued from the plain of Athens, after which it skirted the shores of the bay of Eleusis. The beginning of this road is shown by the map in the Introduction. (2) A road diverging from the former in a N.W. direction, and going round the N. end of the same range of Aegaleos, at a point some miles N. of the Daphn&egrave; pass, into the Thriasian plain. By either route the captors could gain the pass of Dryoscephalae, over Mount Cithaeron, leading from Attica into Boeotia. The hope of Theseus is that the pursuers may reach the point of bifurcation before the captors, since it is conceivable that the latter should wait to be joined by their master, Creon. see on <ref target="cl1054" targOrder="U">1054</ref> ff.

The allusion is not, of course, to Creon's guards, but to some Attic accomplices, whose secret aid had emboldened him to make the attempt (1031).

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">au)ta/rkei boa=|</lemma> is dat. of circumstance.

<p>The poet has left the details of the rescue indistinct. Creon's guards first carried off the girls (844), and Theseus sent mounted Athenians in pursuit (897). Afterwards, Theseus commands Creon to lead him to where the girls are; if they are <quote lang="en">"in these regions"</quote> (1020 <quote lang="greek">e)n to/poisi toi=sd)</quote>), Theseus himself will recover them: if, however, the guards are already flying with them, then <title>Theseus</title> has nothing to do; the mounted Athenians, who have already started, will pursue (1020 ff.). But from the words of Theseus in 1148 it is plain that they have been rescued by his personal prowess, of which he forbears to boast (<quote lang="greek">kompei=n</quote>, 1149): and the same inference must be drawn from Antigone's words (1117). How are these facts to be reconciled? We can only suppose that the mounted Athenians, who started first, halted to watch the <quote lang="greek">di/stomoi o(doi/</quote> (900), while Creon's guards also halted somewhere in concealment, to await their master. Theseus, with Creon, was thus enabled to overtake his Athenians before the struggle. The fact is that Sophocles did not care to think out these points, about which an Athenian audience in the theatre would not trouble themselves. Cp. on <bibl n="Soph. OT 758"><title>O.

</p>
<p>The place meant is not certain. See note and map in Appendix. But the scholium here deserves at least thus much weight: it is our one ancient warrant for a definite view. Like the other old scholia in L, it probably dates (in substance) from the later Alexandrian age, which possessed many Attic writings,  now lost, on the topography of Attica. The scholiast takes the <foreign lang="greek">nifa\s pe/tra</foreign> to be a rock or crag of Mount Aegaleos;&mdash; the same which was called <quote lang="greek">lei/a pe/tra</quote>, <quote lang="en">"the smooth rock,"</quote> by Istros, a writer on Attica, c. 240 B.C., whom he quotes. The schol. then explains <foreign lang="greek">*oi)a/tidos</foreign> by the fact that Aegaleos <quote lang="greek">e)p' e)sxa/twn e)sti\ tou= dh/mou tou/tou</quote>, <quote lang="en">"skirts that deme,"</quote> &mdash;namely, of <quote lang="greek">*oi)/h</quote>. It cannot reasonably be doubted that this statement about <quote lang="greek">*oi)/h</quote>, if it did not rest on the scholiast's own knowledge, was derived from Istros, or from some other old writer on Attic topography.
</p>
<p>The meaning will then be:&mdash;<quote lang="en">"Or perhaps the captors did not take the road through the pass of Daphn&egrave;, which goes by the sea-coast to Eleusis. Perhaps they went round the N. end of Aegaleos, and will soon be emerging on the Thriasian plain, to the west of Aegaleos, near the deme of Oea."</quote> This is also Leake's view (<title>Demi of Attica</title> p. 154). The route supposed would be in the general line of that taken by Archidamus and the Peloponnesians in 431 B.C., when they moved from Oenoe E.S.E. to Acharnae, <quote lang="greek">e)n decia=| e)/xontes to\ *ai)ga/lewn o)/ros</quote>,&mdash; <foreign lang="la">i.e.</foreign> keeping it to the S.,&mdash;<quote lang="greek">dia\ *krwpia=s</quote>, a deme in the valley between the N. end of Aegaleos and the S.W. end of Parnes.

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">xrhsthri/wn</lemma>. The oracle brought to Oed. by Ismene (389) had been received at Thebes (apparently) before the expulsion of Polyneices, since Oed. complains that the two brothers did not avail themselves of it in order to recall him (418). It was to the effect that the welfare of Thebes depended on Oedipus. If Polyneices means the same oracle here, <foreign lang="greek">oi(=s a)\n</foreign> will be Thebes, on the one hand, and any foreign foe of Thebes on the other. But the reference here is rather to a special oracle concerning the war between the brothers, which Polyneices has heard from the <quote lang="greek">ma/nteis</quote> at Argos (cp. 1300).

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ne/a ta/de &hellip; kigxa/nei</lemma>. Two views are admissible: I prefer that which is here placed first.

The Chorus alludes to the doom pronounced on Polyneices and his brother. <quote lang="en">"Here are new ills which I have seen come from the blind stranger,&mdash;unless perchance, Fate is finding fulfilment."</quote> Oedipus has often spoken of the fate which pursues his race (964 etc.), and the Chorus correct their first phrase by surmising that haply this fate, not Oedipus, is the real agent of the doom on the brothers. The schol. took <foreign lang="greek">h)=lqe/ moi</foreign> as a foreboding of the Chorus that they might be <emph>involved</emph> in these alien ills: but <foreign lang="greek">moi</foreign> seems merely to express sympathy.
</p>
<p>(2) Others suppose that a low rumbling of thunder was heard immediately after the exit of Polyneices, and that <foreign lang="greek">e)/ktupen ai)qh/r</foreign> in 1456 merely marks the first <emph>loud</emph> sound. <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ne/a ta/de &hellip; kaka\</lemma> are then the evils which the Chorus forebode from the <emph>incipient</emph> thunder: <foreign lang="greek">h)=lqe/ moi</foreign>=<quote lang="en">"have come <emph>upon</emph> me."</quote></p>

Each step in the <emph>crescendo</emph> of the thunder is marked by words of the Chorus: a second, and louder, peal comes at 1462, a third at 1476. The whole effect of the passage depends on the moralising of the Chorus (1451 ff.) being interrupted by the sudden crash at 1456. (<emph>b</emph>) After the exit of Polyneices, we naturally expect from the Chorus some comment on the father's curse and the son's doom. (<emph>c</emph>) If <foreign lang="greek">ne/a kaka\</foreign> meant <quote lang="en">"new ills"</quote> brought <emph>on the Chorus</emph> by Oed., the language would rather imply that they had suffered something else from him before,&mdash;which is not the case.

The mighty are humbled (as the Labdacidae have been); the lowly, again, are exalted. The last words contain an unconscious hint that the sufferings of Oedipus are well-nigh finished, and that honour is coming to him. At that instant, the thunder is heard.</p>
<p>The MS. words <quote lang="greek">e)pei\ me\n e(/tera &hellip; a)/nw</quote> are thus paraphrased by the schol.: <quote lang="greek">polla\ me\n au)/cwn par' h)=mar, polla\ de\ ei)s to\ e)/mpalin tre/pwn</quote>. This makes it certain that, instead of <foreign lang="greek">e)pei/</foreign>, the schol. had some <emph>participle</emph>, as the form of the sentence plainly requires.

This was a poetical use of <quote lang="greek">stre/fw</quote>, which the schol.'s words <quote lang="greek">ei)s to\ e)/mpalin tre/pwn</quote> were meant to explain. <quote lang="greek">tre/pw</quote> itself was not used alone as=<quote lang="greek">a)natre/pw</quote>, though often in phrases with that sense: cp. the frag. of a satyric drama (Aesch. fr. 304)&mdash;of a domesticated pig&mdash;<quote lang="greek"><lg type="trimeter"><l>h(\ polla/ g' e)n do/moisin ei)/rgastai kaka/,</l>

Wecklein's <foreign lang="greek">e)pe/xwn</foreign> (<quote lang="en">"checking,"</quote> <quote lang="en">"arresting"</quote>) would agree more closely with the metre of the antistrophe as given by the MSS. (see on <ref target="cl1469" targOrder="U">1469</ref>). But <foreign lang="greek">stre/fwn</foreign> requires only the slightest change there, and is metrically preferable on other grounds (see Metrical Analysis): it is also a better contrast to <foreign lang="greek">au)/cwn</foreign>. &mdash; The MS. <foreign lang="greek">e)pei\ me/n</foreign> is untranslatable. It has been explained as (1) <quote lang="en">"sometimes"</quote>=<quote lang="greek">o(te\ me/n</quote>: (2) by an ellipse of a verb, as <quote lang="greek">e)/dwken</quote> (Hermann).

<p>&mdash;<emph>1555</emph> A more splendid dramatic effect than Sophocles has created here could hardly be conceived. Hitherto, throughout the play, Oedipus has been strongly characterised by that timidity in movement, and that sense of physical dependence, which are normal accompaniments of blindness. (Cp. 21, 173 ff., 495 ff., 1206, etc.) Now, suddenly inspired by the Unseen Power which calls him, he becomes the guide of his guides. Now it is they who shrink. Eager and unfaltering, the blind man beckons them on. And so he finally passes from the eyes of the spectators.

<p> The MS. words <foreign lang="greek">to\n a)ei\</foreign> (or <foreign lang="greek">ai)ei\</foreign>) certainly conceal a fault, which is perhaps very old.

The schol. gives nothing better than a fatuous interpretation of <quote lang="greek">to\n a)ei\ bi/oton</quote> as <quote lang="greek">to\ makro\n gh=ras</quote>. The first question is whether the fault is confined to <foreign lang="greek">a)ei/</foreign>. (1) If so, <foreign lang="greek">to/n</foreign> being sound, <foreign lang="greek">a)ei/</foreign> (<emph>a</emph>) may conceal another adv., or an adj.: as <quote lang="greek">a)/rti, a)/bion, ai)no/n, a)lao/n, a)tuxh=</quote>.

Harpocr. <quote lang="greek">*periqoi=dai: dh=mo/s e)sti th=s *oi)nhi+/dos</quote>. <cit><bibl n="Aeschin. 1.156">Aeschin. or. 1 &sect; 156</bibl> <quote lang="greek">*periklei/dhn to\n *periqoi/dhn</quote></cit>: and so <bibl n="Dem. 50.41">[Dem.] or. 50 &sect; 41</bibl>. Eustathius (101. 3) notices both forms, and Dindorf ascribes <quote lang="greek">*peri/qoun</quote> to the Paris MSS. of Georgius Syncellus (the Byzantine chronographer, 800 A.D.), p. 299. 11: vases and inscriptions also give it.

It was reckoned among the twelve towns of the old Attic dodecapolis, and, to judge by the ruins, was a considerable place down to late times (Leake, <title>Demi</title> II. 17&mdash;22). If <quote lang="greek">*qoriki/ou</quote> is unsound, the familiarity of <quote lang="greek">*qori/kioi</quote> as a deme-name may have suggested it.

<p> The MSS. give <foreign lang="greek">to\ fe/ron e)k qeou= kalw=s fe/rein xrh/</foreign>. There has certainly been an interpolation, equivalent to <foreign lang="meter">uu-</foreign>.  (1) Some reject the words <foreign lang="greek">fe/rein xrh/</foreign>. Then <foreign lang="greek">to\ fe/ron e)k qeou= kalw=s</foreign> must be taken with <foreign lang="greek">fle/gesqon</foreign>: <quote lang="en">"As to the fortune sent by heaven for your good, <emph>be not too passionate</emph> in grief"</quote> (pass.): or, if with Herm. the verb is made midd., <quote lang="en">"do not <emph>inflame</emph> the trouble sent for your good"</quote> (cp. the act. in <cit><bibl n="Soph.

So, if the MS. <foreign lang="greek">mhd' a)/gan</foreign> is kept, <foreign lang="greek">mhd'</foreign> =<quote lang="en">"do <emph>not on your part</emph>"</quote> (Herm., <quote lang="la">"<emph>etiam non</emph> debet vos tam vehementer urere"</quote>). But <foreign lang="greek">mhde\n a)/gan</foreign> or <foreign lang="greek">mhd' e)/t' a)/gan</foreign> (see cr. n.) gives in this case a clearer sense. (2) Wecklein, with whom I agree, rejects <foreign lang="greek">kalw=s</foreign> and <foreign lang="greek">xrh/</foreign>, keeping <foreign lang="greek">fe/rein</foreign>. Then <foreign lang="greek">to\ fe/ron e)k qeou= fe/rein</foreign>=<quote lang="en">"<emph>bear</emph> the fate from heaven,"</quote> the inf. standing for imperat., a use fitting in such a precept (<bibl n="Soph. OT 1529"><title>O. T.</title> 1529</bibl>). The origin of the interpolated words is thus clear:  <foreign lang="greek">xrh/</foreign> explained the use of the inf., while <foreign lang="greek">kalw=s</foreign> was meant to fix the sense of <foreign lang="greek">fe/rein</foreign>, lest <foreign lang="greek">to\ fe/ron</foreign> should obscure it.

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">to\ fe/ron</lemma> in this sense admits of two explanations. (1) <quote lang="en">"<title>That which brings</title>"</quote> good or evil.

<head>1737 - 1750</head>
<p>In these verses the utterances usually assigned to Antigone all turn on her anxiety as to a refuge, and her desire to return to Thebes. Such feelings, at this moment, are more in harmony with the character of Ismene (cp. 1735). Antigone is at present absorbed in the yearning to visit her father's tomb, or at least the spot where she last saw him alive (1724). When Theseus appears, it is this wish which she instantly presses on him. Only when it has been put aside does she think of a return to Thebes (1769).</p>
<p>Ought we, then, to read <quote lang="greek">*i*s.</quote> for <quote lang="greek">*a*n.</quote> throughout vv. 1737&mdash;1750? This has been suggested by Bergk. I may observe that the Laur. MS. leaves the question open. At 1730 it has <quote lang="greek">*a*n.</quote> before <quote lang="greek">ti/ to/d' e)pe/plhcas</quote>. After that, there is no indication of any person, but only short lines (-), until at 1741 <quote lang="greek">*a*n.</quote> again stands before <quote lang="greek">fronw=</quote>. The next words, <quote lang="greek">ti/ dh=q'</quote> etc., have <quote lang="greek">*x*o.</quote> before them: but after that no person is indicated till 1751, where <quote lang="greek">*x*o.</quote> (instead of <quote lang="greek">*q*h.</quote>) is erroneously placed before <quote lang="greek">pau/ete</quote>.</p>
<p>I am disposed to think that Sophocles wrote the words for Ismene, but that the fourth-actor difficulty had led to a fluctuation of stage-practice, which helps to account for the ambiguity of the MS. tradition. See the note on the Dramatis Personae. If the part of Ismene, <emph>after</emph> v. 509, was ever taken by a <quote lang="greek">kwfo\n pro/swpon</quote>, there may then have been a wish to keep her part in this scene as small as possible. Similarly at 1689 ff. there is a doubt as to which sister ought to have the words <quote lang="greek">ou) ka/toida...biwto/s</quote>.

This, however, is improbable, and also injurious to the point of v. 1740.

It may be added that, with <foreign lang="greek">a)pefu/geton</foreign>, v. 1740  is somewhat pointless, since the mere allusion in <foreign lang="greek">ta\ sfw=|n</foreign> to Creon's attempt is too vague to answer Antigone's <foreign lang="greek">ti/</foreign>; ("<emph>what</emph> did we escape?").

<p>Antigone suggests that she and Ismene may yet be in time to plead with their two brothers, and so to avert the doom of mutual destruction pronounced on them by their father <bibl n="Soph. OC 1373">(1373)</bibl>. Thus the close of this drama is linked by the poet with the beginning of his earlier <title>Antigone</title>, which opens at a moment just after the deaths of the brothers. The sisters are then living at Thebes, where Creon has succeeded to the throne. An additional pathos is lent to Antigone's part there by the suggestion here of a previous intercession. In Aesch. <title>Theb.</title> it is the Chorus (of Theban maidens) that endeavours to dissuade Eteocles from going to meet his brother <bibl n="Aesch. Seven 677">(677 ff.)</bibl>: in Eur. <title>Phoen.</title> it is their mother Iocasta who seeks to reconcile them <bibl n="Eur. Phoen. 452">(452 ff.)</bibl>.

<p>After <foreign lang="greek">ou)</foreign> in <bibl n="Soph. OC 1776">1776</bibl> the MS. <foreign lang="greek">ga/r</foreign> must be struck out, as Hermann saw, so that the anapaests spoken by Theseus may end with a paroemiac. When anapaests spoken by the Chorus close a tragedy, these always form a system separate from the anapaests (if any) which precede them. This was plainly necessary, in order to avoid an unduly abrupt ending. But if we point thus:&mdash; <foreign lang="greek">pro\s xa/rin: ou) dei= m' a)poka/mnein</foreign>, the asyndeton has a crude effect. Hence, placing only a comma after <foreign lang="greek">pro\s xa/rin</foreign>, we should render:&mdash; "Not only will I do these things, but <emph>in all things</emph> which I am likely to do for your advantage (etc.) I must not <emph>wax weary.</emph>" The sentence begins as if the constr. was to be <foreign lang="greek">dra/sw kai\ ta/de kai\ pa/nta</foreign>.
