<p>The <title>Oedipus Tyrannus</title> is concerned with the fall of the Theban king; the <title>Coloneus</title>, with the close of his life; and the <title>Antigone</title>, with a later episode in the fortunes of his children. But the order of composition was, <title>Antigone</title>, <title>Tyrannus</title>, <title>Coloneus;</title> and the first was separated from the last by perhaps more than thirty years of the poet's life. The priority of the <title>Antigone</title> admits of a probable explanation, which is not without interest. There is some ground for thinking that the subject&mdash;though not the treatment&mdash;was suggested by Aeschylus.</p>
<p>The sisters Antigone and Ismene are not mentioned by<note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Earliest trace of the story.</note> Homer, Hesiod, or Pindar<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="1" resp="RCJ">Salustius, in his Argument to this play (p. 5), notices that the fortunes of the sisters were differently related by other writers. Mimnermus (<date value="-620">c. 620 B.C.</date>) spoke of Ismene having been slain at Thebes by Tydeus, one of the Argive chiefs.  Ion of Chios (<date value="-450">c. 450 B.C.</date>) said that both sisters were burned in the Theban temple of Hera by Laodamas, son of Eteocles, when Thebes was taken in the later war of the Epigoni. Here, then, we have an Ionian contemporary of Sophocles who did not know the legend of Antigone's deed,&mdash;another indication that the legend was of Attic growth.</note>. Antigone's heroism presupposes a legend that burial had been refused to Polyneices. Pindar knows nothing of such a refusal. He speaks of the seven funeral pyres provided at Thebes for the seven divisions of the Argive army<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="2" resp="RCJ"><bibl n="Pind. O. 6">Pind. <title>Ol.</title> 6.15</bibl>; <bibl n="Pind. N. 9"><title>Nem.</title> 9. 24</bibl>.</note>. Similarly Pausanias records a Theban legend that the corpse of Polyneices was burned on the same pyre with that of Eteocles, and that the very flames refused to mingle<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="3" resp="RCJ"><bibl n="Paus. 9.18.3">Paus. 9.18.3</bibl>.</note>. The refusal of burial was evidently an Attic addition to the story.  It served to contrast Theban vindictiveness with Athenian humanity; for it was Theseus who ultimately buried the Argives at Eleusis. If Creon's edict, then, was an Attic invention, it may be conjectured that Antigone's resolve to defy the edict was also the conception of an Attic poet. Aeschylus is the carliest author who refers to the edict against burial, and he is also the first who tells of Antigone's resolve. His Theban trilogy consisted of the <title>La&iuml;us</title>, the <title>Oedipus</title>, and the <title>Seven against Thebes</title><note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="1" resp="RCJ">With regard to this trilogy, see Introd. to the <title>Oedipus Tyrannus</title>, p. xvi.</note>. At the end of the last play a herald proclaims an edict just published by the Council of Thebes; sepulture shall be given to Eteocles, but denied to Polyneices. Antigone at once declares her resolve; she will bury Polyneices. The Theban maidens who form the Chorus are divided. One half of their number goes to attend the funeral of Eteocles; the other half accompanies Antigone to her task. There the play ends.
</p></div2>
<div2 id="ci1s2" type="section" n="2">
<p>The situation, <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">The Aeschylean situation&mdash;contrast with the Sophoclean.</note> as it is thus left by the <title>Seven against Thebes</title>, is essentially different from that in the play of Sophocles. The Antigone of Aeschylus is not isolated in her action, but is escorted by a band of maidens who publicly avow their sympathy. Though the herald enters a formal protest, and hints that the rulers are likely to be &lsquo;severe,&rsquo; yet he does not say that death is to be the price of disobedience, nor, indeed, does he specify any penalty. The Chorus represents average civic opinion; and one half of the Chorus openly defies the decree. A plot which began thus could scarcely end in the Council taking the heroine's life. It rather foreshadows a final solution which shall be favourable to her; and we might surmise that, in loosing the knot, Aeschylus would have resorted to a divine mandate or intervention. But the Antigone of Sophocles stands alone; the penalty of a dreadful death is definitely set before her; and, whatever the Thebans may think of Creon's edict, no one dares to utter a word of disapproval. Taking the two primary facts&mdash;the veto, and Antigone's resolve&mdash; Sophocles has worked in a manner which is characteristically his own.
</p></div2>
<div2 id="ci1s3" type="section" n="3">
<p>Let us first trace the outline of the action.<note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Analysis of the play. I. Prologue: 1-99.</note>  The scene is laid before the palace of Creon,&mdash;once that of Oedipus,&mdash;at Thebes. The city has just been delivered from a great peril. It had been besieged by an Argive army, the allies of the exile Polyneices, whom his brother Eteocles had driven out of Thebes, that he himself might be sole king. But on the day before that with which the play begins, the two brothers had slain each other in single fight. Besides Polyneices, six other leaders of the besiegers had been killed by as many Theban chiefs. Thus deprived of its commanders, the besieging host had fled, panic-stricken, in the night.</p>
<p>It is the moment of dawn. Antigone has asked her sister Ismene to come forth with her from the house, in order that they may converse alone. Creon, their uncle, is now king. He has put forth an edict,&mdash;that Eteocles, the champion of Thebes, shall be honourably buried; but the body of Polyneices, the country's foe, shall be left on the plain outside the walls of Thebes, for dogs and birds to mangle at their will. If any citizen dares to disobey, he shall be stoned to death. Antigone tells her sister that she is resolved to defy this edict, and to bury their brother Polyneices. Ismene vainly seeks to dissuade her; and Antigone goes forth, alone, to do the deed.</p>
<p>The Chorus of fifteen Theban elders now enters. Creon has<note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Parodos: 100-161.</note> summoned them to meet him,&mdash;they do not yet know wherefore. They greet the rising sun, and, in a splendid ode, describe the danger from which Thebes has been saved. The dramatic effect of the ode is to make us feel how grievous, from a Theban point of view, has been the act of Polyneices.</p>
<p>Creon comes forth. Declaring his resolve that patriotism and<note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">II. First episode: 162-331.</note> treason shall never miss their due rewards, he acquaints the Chorus with the purport of his edict,&mdash;that Eteocles shall be honoured, and Polyneices dishonoured. The elders receive the decision with unquestioning respect; though their words are more suggestive of acquiescence than of approval.</p>
<p>A guard arrives, with the startling news that unknown hands have already paid burial rites to Polyneices, by the symbolical act of sprinkling dust on the corpse. Creon dismisses the man with threats of a terrible death, which the other guards shall share, if they fail to discover the men who have thus broken the edict.</p>
<p>The choral ode which follows <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">First stasimon: 332-375. Anapaests, 376-383.</note> is a beautiful treatment of a theme which this mysterious deed suggests,&mdash;human inventiveness,&mdash;its audacity and its almost infinite resource, save for the limits set by fate. As these strains cease, anapaests spoken by the leader of the Chorus express sudden amazement and pain.&mdash;Antigone, the royal maiden, the niece of the king, is led in, a prisoner, in the hands of the guard.</p>
<p>Questioned by Creon, <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">III. Second episode: 384-581.</note>Antigone replies that she knew the edict, but nevertheless paid funeral rites to her brother because she held that no human law could supersede the higher law of the gods. She is ready to die.</p>
<p>Creon, still more incensed by her demeanour, vows that she shall indeed perish by a shameful death. He suspects Ismene also; and she is presently brought in. Agonised by grief for her sister's impending doom, Ismene entreats that she may be considered as sharing the responsibility of the deed; she wishes to die with her sister. Antigone firmly and even sternly, though not bitterly, rejects this claim, which &lsquo;justice will not allow&rsquo;; the deed has been hers only. Ismene vainly seeks to move Creon; he is not touched by her despair, or by the thought&mdash;to which Ismene also appeals&mdash;that his son Haemon is betrothed to Antigone. He orders that both sisters shall be taken into the house, and closely guarded; for his present purpose is that both shall die.</p>
<p><note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Second stasimon: 582-625. Anapaests, 626-630.</note>Moved by the sentence which has just been passed, the Chorus speaks of the destiny which has pursued the royal line of Thebes: &lsquo;When a house hath once been shaken from heaven, there the curse fails nevermore.&rsquo; The sisters were the last hope of the race; and now they too must perish. The ode closes with a strain of general reflection on the power of Zeus and the impotence of human self-will. There is no conscious reference to Creon; but, for the spectators, the words are suggestive and ominous.</p>
<p><note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">IV. Third episode: 631-780.</note>Haemon enters. He has come to plead with his father for the life of his betrothed Antigone. This scene is one of the finest in the play. A lesser dramatist would have been apt to depict Haemon as passionately agitated. The Haemon of Sophocles maintains an entire calm and self-control so long as a ray of hope remains; his pleading is faultless in tone and in tact; he knows Creon, and he does not intercede with him as a lover for his betrothed; he speaks as a son solicitous for his father's reputation, and as a subject concerned for the authority of his king; he keeps his temper under stinging taunts; it is only when Creon is found to be inexorable that the pent-up fire at last flashes out. Then, when Haemon rushes forth,&mdash;resolved, as his latest words hint, not to survive his beloved,&mdash;he leaves with the spectators a profound sense of the supreme effort which he has made in a cause dearer to him than life, and has made without success.</p>
<p>Haemon having quitted the scene, Creon announces, in reply to a question of the Chorus, the mode of death which he designs for Antigone. As for Ismene, he will spare her; her entire innocence has been proved, to his calmer thoughts, by the words which passed between the sisters in his presence. Antigone is to be immured in a sepulchral chamber,&mdash;one of the rock-tombs in the low hills that fringe the plain of Thebes,&mdash;and there she is to be left, with only the formal dole of food which religion prescribes, in order to avert the pollution which the State would otherwise incur through the infliction of death by starvation.</p>
<p>A choral song celebrates the power of Love,&mdash;as seen in <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Third stasimon: 781-800. Anapaests 801-805.</note> Haemon, who has not feared to confront a father's anger in pleading for one who has broken the law. While implying that Haemon has acted amiss, the ode also palliates his action by suggesting that the deity who swayed him is irresistible. At the same time this reference to Haemon's passion serves to deepen the pathos of Antigone's fate.</p>
<p>She is now brought out of the house by Creon's servants,<note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">V. Fourth episode: 806-943.</note> who are to conduct her to her living tomb. At that sight, the Theban elders cry that pity constrains them, even as love constrained Haemon, to deplore the sentence. Antigone speaks to them of her fate, and they answer not unkindly; yet they say plainly that the blame for her doom rests with herself alone; the king could not grant impunity to a breach of his edict. Creon enters, and reproves the guards for their delay. In her latest words, Antigone expresses her confidence in the love which awaits her beyond the grave; and also the trouble which overclouds her trust in the gods, who knew her deed, and yet have permitted her to suffer this doom. Then she is led forth, and is seen no more.</p>
<p><note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Fourth stasimon: 944-987.</note>The rocky tomb to which she is passing suggests the theme of a choral ode, commemorating three other sufferers of a cruel imprisonment,&mdash;Dana&euml;, Lycurgus, and Cleopatra.</p>
<p><note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">VI. Fifth episode: 988-1114.</note>As the choral strains cease, the blind and aged prophet Teiresias is led in by a boy. He comes with an urgent warning for the king. The gods are wroth with Thebes; they will no longer give their prophet any sign by the voice of birds, or through the omens of sacrifice. The king is himself the cause, by his edict. Carrion-creatures have defiled the altars of Thebes with the taint of the unburied dead. Let burial rites be at once paid to Polyneices. He speaks for Creon's own good.</p>
<p>Here we pause for a moment to answer a question which naturally occurs to the modern reader. Why is Polyneices said to be still unburied? Has not Antigone already rendered burial rites to him; is it not precisely for that action that she is dying? Antigone had, indeed, given symbolical sepulture to Polyneices by sprinkling dust upon the corpse, and pouring libations. The performance of that act discharged her personal duty towards the dead and the gods below; it also saved her dead brother from the dishonour (which would else have been a reproach to him in the other world) of having been neglected by his nearest kinsfolk on earth. But Antigone's act did not clear Creon. Creon's duty to the dead and to the gods below was still unperformed. So far as Creon was concerned, Polyneices was still unburied. And Creon's obligation could not be discharged, as Antigone's had been, merely by the symbolical act, which religion accepted only when a person was unavoidably hindered from performing regular rites. There was nothing to hinder Creon from performing such rites. These were still claimed from him. After Antigone's tribute had been rendered, birds and dogs had been busy with the corpse. Creon's duty to the dead and to the gods below was now also a duty towards the polluted State, from which his impiety had alienated the gods above.</p>
<p>In reply to the friendly and earnest warning of Teiresias, Creon angrily accuses the seer of mercenary complicity in a disloyal plot; malcontent Thebans wish to gain a triumph over their king by frightening him into a surrender. Never will be grant burial rites to Polyneices.</p>
<p>Teiresias, angered in his turn, then declares the penalty which the gods reserve for such obduracy. With the life of his own son shall Creon atone for his twofold sin,&mdash;the detention of the dead among the living, and the imprisonment of the living in the abode of the dead. The seer then departs.</p>
<p>Creon is deeply moved. In the course of long and eventful years he has learned a lesson which is present also to the minds of the Theban elders. The word of Teiresias has never failed to come true.</p>
<p>After a hurried consultation with the Chorus, Creon's resolve is taken. He will yield. He immediately starts, with his servants, for the upper part of the Theban plain, where the body of Polyneices is still lying,&mdash;not very far, it would seem, from the place of Antigone's prison.</p>
<p>At this point an objection might suggest itself to the spectator. Is there not something a little improbable in the celerity with which Creon,&mdash;hitherto inflexible,&mdash;is converted by the threats of a seer whom he has just been denouncing as a venal impostor? Granting that experience had attested the seer's infallibility when speaking in the name of the gods, has not Creon professed to believe that, in this instance, Teiresias is merely the mouthpiece of disloyal Thebans? The answer will be found by attentively observing the state of mind which, up to this point, has been portrayed in Creon. He has, indeed, been inflexible; he has even been vehement in asserting his inflexibility. But, under this vehemence, we have been permitted to see occasional glimpses of an uneasy conscience. One such glimpse is at <bibl n="Soph. Ant. 889">vv. 889 f.</bibl>, where he protests that <emph>his</emph> hands are clean in regard to Antigone;&mdash;he had given her full warning, and he has not shed her blood,&mdash;&lsquo;but at any rate&rsquo; (<quote lang="greek">d' ou)=n</quote>,&mdash;i.e., wherever the guilt rests)&mdash;&lsquo;she shall die.&rsquo; Another such trait occurs at <bibl n="Soph. Ant. 1040">v. 1040</bibl>, where he says that he will not bury Polyneices, though the throne of Zeus in heaven should be defiled,&mdash;quickly adding, &lsquo;for I know that no mortal can pollute the gods.&rsquo;<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="1" resp="RCJ">See note <ref target="cl1044" targOrder="U">on v. 1044</ref>.</note> It may further be remarked that a latent self-mistrust is suggested by the very violence of his rejoinder to the Chorus, when they venture, with timid respect, to hint the possibility that some divine agency may have been at work in the mysterious tribute paid to Polyneices (278 f.). A like remark applies to the fury which breaks out at moments in his interviews with Haemon and with Teiresias. The delicacy of the dramatic tact which forbids these touches to be obtrusive is such as Sophocles, alone of the Attic masters, knew how to use. But they suffice to indicate the secret trembling of the balance behind those protestations of an unconquerable resolve; the terrible prophecy of Teiresias only turns the scale.</p>
<p><note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Hyporcheme (taking the place of the fifth stasimon): 1115-1154.</note>The Chorus is now gladdened by the hope that Creon's repentance, late though it is, may avail to avert the doom threatened by Teiresias. This feeling is expressed in a short and joyous ode, which invokes the bright presence of Dionysus. May the joyous god come with healing virtue to his favourite Thebes! The substitution of this lively dance-song (&lsquo;hyporcheme&rsquo;) for a choral ode of a graver cast here serves the same purpose of contrast as in the <title>Oedipus Tyrannus</title>, the <title>Ajax</title>, and the <title>Trachiniae.</title> The catastrophe is approaching<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="2" resp="RCJ">See note <ref target="cl1115" targOrder="U">on v. 1115</ref>.</note>.</p>
<p><note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">VII. Exodos: 1155-1352.</note>A Messenger now enters,&mdash;one of the servants who had accompanied Creon to the plain. The words in which he briefly intimates the nature of his tidings (<bibl n="Soph.

On recovering consciousness, she comes forth, and hears the full account from the Messenger. He says that, when they reached the plain, Creon's first care was for the funeral rites due to Polyneices. After prayer to Pluto and Hecat&egrave;, the remains&mdash;lacerated by birds and dogs&mdash; were washed, and solemnly burned; a high funeral-mound was then raised on the spot. Creon and his followers then repaired to the tomb of Antigone. They found her already dead; she had used her veil to hang herself. Haemon, in a frenzied state, was embracing her corpse. He drew his sword upon his father, who fled. Then, in a swift agony of remorse, the son slew himself.</p>
<p>Having heard this news, Eurydic&egrave; silently retires into the house.</p>
<p>She has hardly withdrawn, when Creon enters, with attendants, carrying Haemon's shrouded corpse<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="1" resp="RCJ">i.e., an effigy. The deuteragonist, who had acted Haemon, had been on the stage, as Messenger, up to v. 1256, and had still to come on as Second Messenger at <bibl n="Soph. Ant. 1278">v. 1278</bibl>.</note> upon a bier. He bewails his own folly as the cause of his son's death. Amid his laments, a Messenger from the house announces that Eurydic&egrave; has stabbed herself at the household altar, with imprecations on the husband. Wholly desolate and wretched, Creon prays for death; nor has the Chorus any gentler comfort for him than the stern precept of resignation,&mdash;&lsquo;Pray thou no more; mortals have no escape from destined woe.&rsquo; As he is conducted into the house, the closing words of the drama are spoken by the leader of the Chorus: &lsquo;Wisdom is the supreme part of happiness, and reverence towards the gods must be inviolate. Great words of prideful men are ever punished with great blows, and in old age teach the chastened to be wise.&rsquo;

<p>This sketch may serve to illustrate the powerful unity<note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Unity of motive.</note> of the play. The issue defined in the opening scene,&mdash;the conflict of divine with human law,&mdash;remains the central interest throughout. The action, so simple in plan, is varied by masterly character-drawing, both in the two principal figures, and in those lesser persons who contribute gradations of light and shade to the picture. There is no halting in the march of the drama; at each successive step we become more and more keenly interested to see how this great conflict is to end; and when the tragic climax is reached, it is worthy of such a progress. It would not,<note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">The mode of the catastrophe.</note> however, be warrantable to describe the construction of the play as faultless. No one who seeks fully to comprehend and enjoy this great work of art can be content to ignore certain questions which are suggested by one part of it,&mdash;the part from <bibl n="Soph. Ant. 998">v. 998</bibl> to <bibl n="Soph. Ant. 1243">1243</bibl>, which introduces and developes the catastrophe.</p>
<p>Teiresias, as we saw, came with the benevolent purpose of warning Creon that he must bury Polyneices. Creon was stubborn, and Teiresias then said that the gods would punish him. Haemon would die, because his father had been guilty of two sins,&mdash;burying Antigone alive<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="1" resp="RCJ">In his first, or friendly, speech to Creon (<bibl n="Soph. Ant. 998">998-1032</bibl>) Teiresias says not a word concerning Antigone. Possibly he may be conceived as thinking that the burial of Polyneices would imply, as a consequence, the release of Antigone; though it is obvious that, from Creon's point of view, such an inference would be illogical: Antigone was punished because she had broken the edict; not because the burying of Polyneices was intrinsically wrong.</note>, and dishonouring the corpse of Polyneices. This prophecy assumed that Creon would remain obdurate. But, in the event, he immediately yielded; he buried Polyneices, and attempted, though too late, to release Antigone. Now suppose that he had been in time to save Antigone. He would then have cancelled both his offences. And then, we must infer, the divine punishment predicted by Teiresias would have been averted; since the prediction does not rest on any statement that a specific term of grace had expired. Otherwise we should have to suppose that the seer did not know the true mind of the gods when he represented that Creon might still be saved by repentance (<bibl n="Soph. Ant. 1025">1025 ff.</bibl>). But the dramatic function of Teiresias obviously requires us to assume that he was infallible whenever he spoke from &lsquo;the signs of his art&rsquo;; indeed, the play tells us that he was so (<bibl n="Soph. Ant. 1094">1094</bibl>).</p>
<p>Everything depended, then, on Creon being in time to save Antigone. Only a very short interval can be imagined between the moment at which she is led away to her tomb and that at which Creon resolves to release her; in the play it is measured by 186 verses (<bibl n="Soph. Ant. 928">928-1114</bibl>). The Chorus puts Creon's duties in the natural order; &lsquo;free the maiden from her rocky chamber, and make a tomb for the unburied dead&rsquo; (<bibl n="Soph. Ant. 1100">1100</bibl>); and Creon seems to feel that the release, as the more urgent task, ought to have precedence. Nevertheless, when he and his men arrive on the ground, his first care is given to Polyneices. After the rites have been performed, a high mound is raised. Only then does he proceed to Antigone's prison,&mdash;and then it is too late. We are not given any reason for the burial being taken in hand before the release. The dramatic fault here has nothing to do with any estimate of the chances that Creon might actually have saved Antigone's life, if he had gone to her first. The poet might have chosen to imagine her as destroying herself immediately after she had been left alone in her cell. In any case, the margin for Creon must have been a narrow one. The<note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">The dramatic blemish.</note> dramatic fault is that, while we, the spectators, are anxious that Antigone should be saved, and while every moment is precious, we are left to conjecture why Creon should be spending so many of these moments in burial rites which could have been rendered equally well after Antigone had been rescued: nay, when the rites have been finished, he remains to build a mound. The source of pathos contained in the words &lsquo;too late&rsquo; is available for Tragedy, but evidently there is one condition which must be observed. A fatal delay must not seem to be the result merely of negligence or of caprice. As Bellermann has justly said, modern drama has obeyed this rule with a heedfulness not always shown by the ancients. Shakespeare took care that there should be a good reason for the delay of Lorenzo to resuscitate Juliet; nor has Schiller, in the <title>Death of Wallenstein,</title> left it obscure why Octavio arrived only after Buttler's deed had been done. Euripides, on the other hand, is content that the prolixity of a Messenger's speech should detain Iocasta until the sons whom she longed to reconcile had killed each other.
</p></div2>
<div2 id="ci1s5" type="section" n="5">
<p>With regard to Creon's delay in the <title>Antigone</title>, I venture <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">A suggested explanation.</note> to suggest that the true explanation is a simple one. If it seems inadequate when tried by the gauge of modern drama, it will not do so (I think) to those who remember two characteristics of old Greek drama,&mdash;first, the great importance of the rhetorical element, more particularly as represented by the speeches of messengers; secondly, the occasional neglect of clearness, and even of consistency, in regard to matters which either precede the action of the drama (<quote lang="greek">ta\ e)/cw th=s tragw|di/as</quote>), or, though belonging to the drama itself, occur off the stage. The speech of the first Messenger in the <title>Antigone</title> (<bibl n="Soph. Ant. 1192">1192-1243</bibl>) relates the catastrophe with which the tragedy culminates. Its effect was therefore of the highest importance. Now, if this speech had first related the terrible scene in Antigone's tomb, and had then passed on to the quiet obsequies of Polyneices, its rhetorical impressiveness would have been destroyed. It was indispensable that the latter part of the recital should correspond with the climax of tragic interest. This, I believe, was the motive present to the poet's mind when, after indicating in the dialogue that the release was to precede the burial, he reversed that order in composing the Messenger's speech. He knew that his Athenian audience would be keenly susceptible to the oratorical quality of that speech, while they would be either inattentive, or very indulgent, to the defect in point of dramatic consistency. The result is a real blemish, though not a serious one; indeed, it may be said to compensate the modern reader for its existence by exemplifying some tendencies of the art which admitted it.
</p></div2>
<div2 id="ci1s6" type="section" n="6">
<p>The simplicity of the plot <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">The question raised by the play.</note>is due,&mdash;as the foregoing sketch has shown,&mdash;to the clearness with which two principles are opposed to each other. Creon represents the duty of obeying the State's laws; Antigone, the duty of listening to the private conscience. The definiteness and the power with which the play puts the case on each side are conclusive proofs that the question had assumed a distinct shape before the poet's mind. It is the only instance in which a Greek play has for its central theme a practical problem of conduct, involving issues, moral and political, which might be discussed on similar grounds in any age and in any country of the world. Greek Tragedy, owing partly to the limitations which it placed on detail, was better suited than modern drama to raise such a question in a general form. The <title>Antigone</title>, indeed, raises the question in a form as nearly abstract as is compatible with the nature of drama. (The case of Antigone is a thoroughly typical one for the private conscience, because the particular thing which she believes that she ought to do was, in itself, a thing which every Greek of that age recognised as a most sacred duty,&mdash; viz., to render burial rites to kinsfolk.) This advantage was not devised by Sophocles; it came to him as part of the story which he was to dramatise; but it forms an additional reason for thinking that, when he dramatised that story in the precise manner which he has choscn, he had a consciously dialectical purpose<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="1" resp="RCJ">This point might be illustrated by contrast with an able romance, of which the title is borrowed from this play of Sophocles. &lsquo;The New Antigone&rsquo; declined the sanction of marriage, because she had been educated by a father who had taught her to regard that institution as wrongful. Such a case was not well suited to do dramatically what the <title>Antigone</title> of Sophocles does,&mdash;to raise the question of human law against private conscience in a general form,&mdash;because the institution concerned claims to be more than a human ordinance, and because, on the other hand, the New Antigone's opinion was essentially an accident of perverted conscience. The author of the work was fully alive to this, and has said (<bibl><title>Spectator</title>, Nov. 5, 1887</bibl>) that his choice of a title conveyed &lsquo;a certain degree of irony.&rsquo;</note> Such a purpose was wholly consistent, in this instance, with the artist's first aim,&mdash;to produce a work of art. It is because Creon and Antigone are so human that the controversy which they represent becomes so vivid.
</p></div2>
<div2 id="ci1s7" type="section" n="7">
<p>But how did Sophocles intend us to view the result?<note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">What is the moral intended?</note> What is the drift of the words at the end, which say that &lsquo;wisdom is the supreme part of happiness&rsquo;? If this wisdom, or prudence (<quote lang="greek">to\ fronei=n</quote>), means, generally, the observance of due limit, may not the suggested moral be that both the parties to the conflict were censurable? As Creon overstepped the due limit when, by his edict, he infringed the divine law, so Antigone also overstepped it when she defied the edict. The drama would thus be a conflict between two persons, each of whom defends an intrinsically sound principle, but defends it in a mistaken way; and both persons are therefore punished. This view, of which Boeckh is the chief representative, has found several supporters. Among them is Hegel:&mdash;&lsquo;In the view of the Eternal Justice, both were wrong, because they were onesided; but at the same time both were right<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="2" resp="RCJ"><title>Religionsphilosophie</title>, II. 114.</note>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Or does the poet rather intend us to feel that Antigone is wholly in the right,&mdash;i.e., that nothing of which the human lawgiver could complain in her was of a moment's account beside the supreme duty which she was fulfilling;&mdash;and that Creon was wholly in the wrong,&mdash;i.e., that the intrinsically sound maxims of government on which he relies lose all validity when opposed to the higher law which he was breaking? If that was the poet's meaning, then the &lsquo;wisdom&rsquo; taught by the issue of the drama means the sense which duly subordinates human to divine law,&mdash;teaching that, if the two come into conflict, human law must yield.</p>
<p>This question is one which cannot be put aside by merely suggesting that Sophocles had no didactic purpose at all, but left us to take whichever view we please. For, obviously, according as we adopt one or other of the views, our estimate of the play as a work of art must be vitally affected. The punishments meted out to Creon and Antigone respectively require us to consider the grounds on which they rest. A difference will be made, too, in our conception of Antigone's character, and therefore in our judgment as to the measure of skill with which the poet has portrayed her.</p>
<p>A careful study of the play itself will suffice (I think) to show that the second of the two views above mentioned is the true one. Sophocles has allowed Creon to put his case ably, and (in a measure from which an inferior artist might have shrunk) he has been content to make Antigone merely a nobly heroic woman, not a being exempt from human passion and human weakness; but none the less does he mean us to feel that, in this controversy, the right is wholly with her, and the wrong wholly with her judge.
</p></div2>
<div2 id="ci1s8" type="section" n="8">
<p>In the first place it is necessary to appreciate the nature of Creon's edict <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">The character of Creon's edict.</note> against burying Polyneices. Some modern estimates of the play have seemed to assume that such refusal of sepulture, though a harsh measure, was yet one which the Greek usage of the poet's age recognised as fairly applicable to public enemies, and that, therefore, Creon's fault lay merely in the degree of his severity. It is true that the legends of the heroic age afford some instances in which a dead enemy is left unburied, as a special mark of abhorrence. This dishonour brands the exceptionally base crime of Aegisthus<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="1" resp="RCJ"> <bibl n="Soph. El. 1487"><title>El.</title> 1487</bibl> ff.</note> Yet these same legends also show that, from a very early period, Hellenic feeling was shocked at the thought of carrying enmity beyond the grave, and withholding those rites on which the welfare of the departed spirit was believed to depend. The antiquity of the maxim that, after a battle, the conquerors were bound to allow the vanquished to bury their dead, is proved by the fact that it was ascribed either to Theseus<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="1" resp="RCJ"><bibl n="Plut. Thes. 29">Plut. <title>Thes.</title> 29.</bibl></note> or to Heracles<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="2" resp="RCJ">Aelian <title>Var. Hist.</title> 12. 27.</note>. Achilles maltreated the dead Hector. Yet, even there, the <title>Iliad</title> expresses the Greek feeling by the beautiful and touching fable that the gods themselves miraculously preserved the corpse from all defacement and from all corruption, until at last the due obsequies were rendered to it in Troy<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="3" resp="RCJ"><bibl n="Hom. Il. 24.411"><title>Il.</title> 24.411</bibl> ff.</note>. The Atreidae refused burial to Ajax; but Odysseus successfully pleaded against the sentence, and Ajax was ultimately buried with all honour<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="4" resp="RCJ"> <bibl n="Soph. Aj. 1332"><title>Ai.</title> 1332</bibl> ff.</note>. In giving that issue to his play, Sophocles was doing what the general feeling of his own age would strongly demand. Greeks of the fifth century B.C. observed the duty towards the dead even when warfare was bitterest, and when the foe was barbarian. The Athenians buried the Persians slain at Marathon, as the Persians buried the Lacedaemonians slain at Thermopylae. A notable exception may, indeed, be cited; but it is one of those exceptions which forcibly illustrate the rule. The Spartan Lysander omitted to bury the Athenians who fell at Aegospotami; and that omission was remembered, centuries later, as an indelible stigma upon his name<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="5" resp="RCJ"><bibl n="Paus. 9.32.6">Paus. 9.32.6</bibl>.</note>.</p>
<p>Thus the audience for which Sophocles composed the <title>Antigone</title> would regard Creon's edict as something very different from a measure of exceptional, but still legitimate, severity. They would regard it as a shocking breach of that common piety which even the most exasperated belligerents regularly respected.
</p></div2>
<div2 id="ci1s9" type="section" n="9">
<p>The next point to be considered is, In what sense,<note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">The edict in its political aspect.</note> and how far, does Creon, in this edict, represent the State? He is the lawful king of Thebes. His royal power is conceived as having no definite limit. The words of the Chorus testify that he is acting within the letter of his right; &lsquo;thou hast power, I ween, to take what order thou wilt, both for the dead, and for all us who live&rsquo; (<bibl n="Soph. Ant. 211">211 f.</bibl>). On the other hand, he is acting against the unanimous, though silent, sense of Thebes, which, as his son Haemon tells him, held that Antigone had done a glorious deed (<bibl n="Soph. Ant. 695">695</bibl>). Creon replies: &lsquo;Shall Thebes prescribe to me how I shall rule?&rsquo; His son rejoins: &lsquo;That is no city (<quote lang="greek">po/lis</quote>), which belongs to one man&rsquo; (<bibl n="Soph. Ant. 737">737</bibl>). Where the unanimous opinion of the community was ignored, the Athenians of the poet's day would feel that, as Haemon says, there was no &lsquo;city&rsquo; at all. Indeed, when Creon summoned &lsquo;the conference of elders,&rsquo; that summons was itself an admission that he was morally bound to take account of other judgments besides his own. We may often notice in the Attic drama that the constitutional monarchy of the legendary heroic age is made to act in the spirit, and speak in the tone, of the unconstitutional <foreign lang="la">tyrannus</foreign>, as the historical age knew it. This was most natural; it gave an opening for points sure to tell with a &lsquo;tyrant-hating&rsquo; Athenian audience, and it was perfectly safe from objection on the ground of anachronism,&mdash;an objection which was about the last that Athenian spectators were likely to raise, if we may judge by the practice of the dramatists. Now, the Creon of the <title>Antigone</title>, though nominally a monarch of the heroic age, has been created by the Attic poet in the essential image of the historical <foreign lang="la">tyrannus.</foreign> The Attic audience would mentally compare him, not to an Agamemnon or an Alcinous, but to a Hippias or a Periander. He resembles the ruler whose absolutism, imposed on the citizens by force, is devoid of any properly political sanction. [Antigone can certainly be described, with technical correctness, as acting &lsquo;in despite of the State,&rsquo; since Creon is the State, so far as a State exists.] But the Greeks for whom Sophocles wrote would not regard Creon's edict as having a constitutional character, in the sense in which that character belonged to laws sanctioned (for instance) by the Athenian Ecclesia. They would liken it rather to some of the arbitrary and violent acts done by Hippias in the later period of his &lsquo;tyranny.&rsquo; To take a modern illustration, they would view it in a quite different light from that in which we should regard the disobedience of a Russian subject to a ukase of the Czar.</p>
<p>If, then, we endeavour to interpret Creon's action by the standards which the poet's contemporaries would apply, we find, first, that he is doing a monstrous act; secondly, that, in doing it, he cannot, indeed, be said to exceed his prerogative, since this is indefinite; but he is exceeding his moral right in such a manner that he becomes the counterpart of the <foreign lang="la">tyrannus</foreign> who makes a cruel use of an unconstitutional power.
</p></div2>
<div2 id="ci1s10" type="section" n="10">
<p>Antigone, on the other hand, is fulfilling one of the most<note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Antigone's position.</note> sacred and the most imperative duties known to Greek religion; and it is a duty which could not be delegated. She and her sister are the nearest kinsfolk of the dead. It is not to be expected that any stranger should brave the edict for the dead man's sake. As the Chorus says, &lsquo;no man is so foolish that he is enamoured of death&rsquo; (<bibl n="Soph. Ant. 220">220</bibl>). Creon is furious when the Chorus suggests that the rites so mysteriously paid to the corpse may have been due to the agency of the gods (<bibl n="Soph. Ant. 278">278 f.</bibl>). That very suggestion of the Chorus shows how impossible it seemed to the Theban mind that Polyneices could receive the ministration of any human hand. A modern critic, taking the view that Antigone was wrong, has observed (not ironically) that she ought to have left the gods to provide the burial. It would have been ill for the world if all who have done heroic deeds had preferred to await miracles. As to another suggestion,&mdash;that Antigone ought to have tried persuasion with Creon,&mdash;the poet has supplied the answer in his portraiture of Creon's character,&mdash;a character known to Antigone from long experience. The situation in which Antigone was placed by Creon's edict was analogous to that of a Christian martyr under the Roman Empire. It was as impossible for Antigone to withhold those rites, which no other human being could now render, as it was impossible for the Christian maiden to avoid the torments of the arena by laying a grain of incense on the altar of Diana<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="1" resp="RCJ">Mr Long's beautiful picture, &lsquo;Diana or Christ,&rsquo; will be remembered by many,&mdash; and the more fitly, since it presents a counterpart, not only for Antigone, but also for Creon and for Haemon.</note>. From both alike those laws which each believed to be &lsquo;the unfailing statutes of Heaven&rsquo; claimed an allegiance which no human law could cancel, and it was by the human ruler, not by his victim, that the conflict of loyalties had been made inevitable.
</p></div2>
<div2 id="ci1s11" type="section" n="11">
<p>One of the main arguments <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">The attitude of the Chorus.</note> used to show that Sophocles conceived Antigone as partly censurable has been drawn from the utterances of the Chorus. It is therefore important to determine, if we can, what the attitude of these Theban Elders really is. Their first ode (the Parodos) shows how strongly they condemn Polyneices, as having led a hostile army against his country. We might have expected, then, that, when Creon acquainted them with his edict, they would have greeted it with some mark of approval. On the contrary, their words are confined to a brief utterance of submission: &lsquo;Such is thy pleasure, Creon, son of Menoeceus, touching this city's foe, and its friend; and thou hast power, I ween, to take what order thou wilt, both for the dead, and for all us who live&rsquo; (<bibl n="Soph. Ant. 211">211 ff.</bibl>). We can see that they are startled by such a doom, even for a man whom they hold deeply guilty. Their words suggest a misgiving. Just afterwards, they significantly excuse themselves from taking any part in the enforcement of the edict (<bibl n="Soph. Ant. 216">216</bibl>). But it is otherwise when the edict, having been published, is broken. Then they range themselves on Creon's side. They refer to the disobedience as a daring offence (<bibl n="Soph. Ant. 371">371</bibl>). When Antigone is brought in, they speak of her folly (<bibl n="Soph. Ant. 383">383</bibl>). Nevertheless, Antigone is convinced that, in their hearts, they sympathise with her (<bibl n="Soph. Ant. 504">504</bibl>). And, indeed, it is plain that they do so, to this extent,&mdash;that they consider the edict to have been a mistake; though they also hold that it was wrong to break the edict. Hence they speak of Antigone's act as one prompted by &lsquo;frenzy at the heart&rsquo; (<bibl n="Soph. Ant. 603">603</bibl>). The clearest summary of their whole view&mdash;up to this point of the drama&mdash;is given in verses <bibl n="Soph. Ant. 872">872-875</bibl>, and amounts to this:&mdash;Antigone's act was, in itself, a pious one; but Creon, as a ruler, was bound to vindicate his edict. Her &lsquo;self-willed temper&rsquo; has brought her to death.</p>
<p>So far, then, the view taken by the Chorus is very much Boeckh's:&mdash;the merits are divided; Creon is both right and wrong; so, too, is Antigone. But then Teiresias comes (<bibl n="Soph. Ant. 988">v. 988</bibl>), and convinces the Chorus that Creon has been wholly wrong; wrong in refusing burial to Polyneices; wrong in punishing Antigone. It is at the urgent advice of the Chorus that Creon yields. And when, a little later, Creon blames himself as the cause of all the woe, the Chorus replies that now at last he sees the truth (<bibl n="Soph. Ant. 1270">v. 1270</bibl>). Thus the Theban Elders entertain two different opinions in succession. Their first opinion is overthrown by Teiresias. Their second opinion&mdash;which they hold from verse 1091 onwards&mdash;is that which the poet intends to be recognised as the true one.
</p></div2>
<div2 id="ci1s12" type="section" n="12">
<p>After thus tracing the mind of the Chorus, we can see<note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Why the Chorus is so constituted.</note> more clearly why it is composed of Theban elders. When the chief person of a Greek tragedy is a woman, the Chorus usually consists of women, whose attitude towards the heroine is more or less sympathetic. Such is the case in the <title>Electra</title> and the <title>Trachiniae</title>, and in seven plays of Euripides,&mdash;the <title>Andromache</title>, <title>Electra</title>, <title>Hecuba</title>, <title>Helena</title>, both <title>Iphigeneias</title>, and <title>Medea.</title> The Chorus of the <title>Alcestis</title>, indeed, consists of Pheraean elders: but then Alcestis is withdrawn from the scene at an early moment, and restored to it only at the end: during the rest of the play, the interest is centred in Admetus. In the <title>Antigone</title>, Sophocles had a double reason for constituting the Chorus as he did. First, the isolation of the heroine would have been less striking if she had been supported by a group of sympathetic women. Secondly, the natural predisposition of the Theban nobles to support their king heightens the dramatic effect of their ultimate conversion.
</p></div2>
<div2 id="ci1s13" type="section" n="13">
<p>The character of Antigone is a separate question from<note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Character of Antigone.</note> the merit of the cause in which she is engaged. She might be doing right, and yet the poet might have represented her as doing it in such a manner as to render her heroism unattractive. We may now turn to this question, and consider what manner of woman she is.</p>
<p>Two qualities are at the basis of her character. One is an enthusiasm, at once steadfast and passionate, for the right, as she sees it,&mdash;for the performance of her duty. The other is intense tenderness, purity, and depth of domestic affection; manifested here in the love of sister for brother, a love which death has not weakened, but only consecrated; as in the <title>Oedipus Coloneus</title>&mdash;where the portraiture of her is entirely in unison with that given here&mdash;it is manifested in the tender anxiety to reconcile her living brothers, and in the fearless, completely selfless devotion&mdash;through painful wanderings, through all misery and all reproach&mdash;to the old age of her blind and homeless father. In the opening scene of the play, we find her possessed by a burning indignation at the outrage done to her dead brother; the deep love which she feels for him is braced by a clear sense of the religious duty which this edict lays upon her, and by an unfaltering resolve to do it; it never occurs to her for an instant that, as a true sister, she could act otherwise; rather it seems wonderful to her that the author of the edict should even have expected it to prove deterrent&mdash;for <emph>her</emph> (<bibl n="Soph. Ant. 32">ver. 32</bibl>).</p>
<p>With her whole heart and soul <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Her relation to Ismene.</note> dominated by these feelings, she turns to her sister Ismene, and asks for her aid; not as if the response could be doubtful&mdash;she cannot imagine its being doubtful; it does not enter her mind that one whom she has just addressed by so dear a name, and with whom her tie of sisterhood is made closer still by the destiny which has placed them apart, can be anything but joyful and proud to risk life in the discharge of a duty so plain, so tender, and so sacred. And how does Ismene meet her? Ismene reminds her that other members of their house have perished miserably, and that, if Antigone acts thus, Antigone and she will die more miserably still: they are women, and must not strive with men; they are subjects, and must not strive with rulers: Ismene will ask the dead to excuse her, since she is constrained, and will obey the living: &lsquo;for it is witless <emph>to be over-busy</emph>&rsquo; (<quote lang="greek">perissa\ pra/ssein</quote>, <bibl n="Soph. Ant. 68">v. 68</bibl>). Ismene is amiable enough; she cannot be called exceptionally weak or timid; she is merely the average woman; her answer here is such as would have been made by most women&mdash;and perhaps by a still larger proportion of men, as the Chorus afterwards forcibly reminds us. But, given the character and the present mood of Antigone, what must be the effect of such a reply to such an appeal? It is the tenderness, quite as much as the strength, of Antigone's spirit that speaks in her answer:&mdash;&lsquo;I will not urge thee,&mdash;no, nor, if thou yet shouldst have the mind, wouldst thou be welcome as a worker with me.&rsquo; And the calmest reason thoroughly approves that answer; for the very terms in which Ismene had repulsed her sister proved a nature which could never rise to the height of such a task, and which would be more dangerous as an ally than as a neutral.</p>
<p>When the sisters next meet, it is in Creon's presence, and the situation is this:&mdash;Antigone has done the deed, unaided; and Creon has said that both sisters shall die&mdash;for he suspects Ismene of complicity. Ismene's real affection is now quickened by a fevcrish remorse, and by an impulse towards self-immolation,&mdash; an impulse of a sentimental and almost hysterical kind: she will say that she helped Antigone; she will die with her; she will yet make amends to the dead. Was Antigone to indulge Ismene's impulse, and to allow Ismene's words to confirm Creon's suspicions? Surely Antigone was bound to do what she does,&mdash;namely, to speak out the truth: &lsquo;Nay, Justice will not suffer thee to do that; thou didst <emph>not</emph> consent to the deed, neither did I give thee part in it.&rsquo; But it will be said that her tone towards Ismene is too stern and hard. The sternness is only that of truth; the hardness is only that of reality: for, among the tragic circumstances which surround Antigone, this is precisely one of the most tragic, that Ismene's earlier conduct, at the testing-point of action, <emph>has</emph> made a spiritual division which no emotional after-impulse can cancel. One more point may be raised: when Ismene says, &lsquo;What life is dear to me, bereft of thee?&rsquo;&mdash;Antigone replies, &lsquo;Ask Creon&mdash;all thy care is for him&rsquo; (<bibl n="Soph. Ant. 549">v. 549</bibl>): is not this, it may be asked, a needless taunt? The answer is found in Antigone's wish to save Ismene's life. Thus far in the dialogue, Ismene has persisted&mdash;even after Antigone's denial&mdash;in claiming a share in the deed (<bibl n="Soph. Ant. 536">vv. 536-547</bibl>). Creon might well think that, after all, the fact was as he suspected. It was necessary for Antigone to make him see&mdash;by some trenchant utterance&mdash;that she regarded Ismene as distinctly ranged on his side. And she succeeded. Later in the play, where Creon acknowledges Ismene's innocence, he describes it in the very phrase which Antigone had impressed upon his memory; he speaks of Ismene as one &lsquo;<emph>who has not touched</emph>&rsquo; the deed (<bibl n="Soph. Ant. 771">v. 771</bibl>: cp. <bibl n="Soph. Ant. 546">v. 546</bibl>). It is with pain (<bibl n="Soph. Ant. 551">v. 551</bibl>), it is not with scorn or with bitterness, that Antigone remains firm. Her attitude is prescribed equally by regard for truth and right, and by duty towards her sister.
</p>
<p>Antigone is betrothed to Haemon; <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Her relation to Haemon.</note> the closeness of the affection between them is significantly marked by the words of Ismene (<bibl n="Soph. Ant. 570">v. 570</bibl>); it is expressed in the words, the deeds, and the death, of Haemon. If verse <bibl n="Soph. Ant. 572">572</bibl> is rightly assigned to Antigone (as, in my opinion, it is), that brief utterance tells much: but let us suppose that it belongs to Ismene, and that Antigone never once refers directly to Haemon: we say, &lsquo;directly,&rsquo; because more than once she alludes to sweet hopes which life had still to offer her. It is evident that, if Sophocles had given greater prominence to Antigone's love for Haemon, he could have had only one aim, consistently with the plan of this play,&mdash;viz., to strengthen our sense of the ties which bound her to life, and, therefore, of her heroism in resigning it. But it is also evident that he could have done this, with any effect, only at the cost of depicting a mind divided between the desire of earthly happiness and the resolve to perform a sacred duty. Sophocles has preferred to portray Antigone as raised above every selfish thought, even the dearest, by the absorbing and inspiring sense of her duty to the dead, and to the gods; silent, not through apathy, concerning a love which could never be hers, and turning for comfort to the faith that, beyond the grave, the purest form of human affection would reunite her to those whom she had lost. It is no blame to later dramatists that they found it necessary to make more of the love-motive; but, if our standard is to be the noblest tragic art, it is a confession of their inferiority to Sophocles. There is a beautiful verse in the play which might suggest how little he can have feared that his heroine would ever be charged with a cold insensibility. Creon has urged that the honour which she has shown to Polyneices will be resented by the spirit of Eteocles. Antigone answers, &lsquo;It is not my nature to join in hating, but in loving.&rsquo; As she had sought to reconcile them while they lived, so now she will have no part in their feud&mdash;if feud there be where they have gone,&mdash;but will love each, as he loves her.</p>
<p>So long as her task lies before Antigone, <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">The reaction in Antigone's mind.</note> she is sustained by the necessity for action. Nor does she falter for a moment, even after the deed has been done, so long as she is in the presence of Creon. For though she has no longer the stimulus of action, there is still another challenge to her fortitude; she, who is loyal to the divine law, cannot tremble before the man who is its embodied negation. It is otherwise when Creon is gone, and when there are only the Theban elders to see and hear her, as she is led to death. The strain on her mind is relaxed; the end is near; she now feels the longing for some word of pity as she passes to the grave,&mdash;for some token of human kindness. But, while she craves such sympathy, the Theban nobles merely console her with the thought of posthumous fame. She compares her doom to Niobe's; and they reply that it is a glory for her to be as Niobe, a daughter of the Tantalidae,&mdash; </p><l>the seed of gods, </l><l>Men near to Zeus; for whom on Ida burns, </l><l>High in clear air, the altar of their Sire, </l><l>Nor hath their race yet lost the blood divine<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="1" resp="RCJ">From the <title>Niobe</title> of Aeschylus (fr. 157): <quote lang="greek">oi( qew=n a)gxi/sporoi, &verbar; oi( *zhno\s e)ggu/s: oi(=s kat' )*idai=on pa/gon &verbar; *dio\s patrw/|ou bwmo/s e)st' e)n ai)qe/ri, &verbar; kou)/pw nin e)ci/thlon ai)=ma daimo/nwn</quote>.</note>.</l>
<p>Few things in tragedy are more pathetic than this yearning of hers, on the brink of death, for some human kindness of farewell, thus &lsquo;mocked&rsquo;<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="2" resp="RCJ"><bibl n="Soph.

She turns from men to invoke &lsquo;the fount of Dirc&egrave; and the holy ground of Thebes&rsquo;; these, at least, will be her witnesses. In her last words, she is thinking of the dead, and of the gods; she feels sure of love in the world of the dead; but she cannot lift her face to the gods, and feel sure that they are with her. If they are so, why have they allowed her to perish for obeying them? Yet, again, they <emph>may</emph> be with her; she will know beyond the grave. If she has sinned, she will learn it there; but if she is innocent, the gods will vindicate when she is gone. How infinitely touching is this supreme trouble which clouds her soul at the last,&mdash;this doubt and perplexity concerning the gods! For it is not a misgiving as to the paramount obligation of the &lsquo;unwritten laws&rsquo; which she has obeyed: it is only an anguish of wonder and uncertainty as to the mysterious ways of the powers which have laid this obligation on mortals,&mdash;a surmise that, as gods and men seem alike without pity for her, there has perhaps been something wrong in her way of doing the duty which was so clear and so binding.
</p></div2>
<div2 id="ci1s14" type="section" n="14">
<p>The psychology of Sophocles <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Distinctive merit of the portraiture.</note> is so excellent in the case of Antigone because he has felt that in a truly heroic nature there is the permanent strength of deep convictions, but there is also room for what superficial observers might think a moral anticlimax. So long as such a nature has to meet antagonism in word or deed, its permanent strength is heightened by a further support which is necessarily transient, &mdash;the strength of exaltation. But a mind capable of heroism is such as can see duties in their true proportions, and can sacrifice everything to the discharge of the highest: and it is such a mind, too, which, in looking back on a duty done, is most liable&mdash;through very largeness of vision, and sense of human limitations&mdash;to misgivings like those which vex the last moments of Antigone. The strength of exaltation has passed away; her clear intelligence cannot refuse to acknowledge that the actual results of doing right are in seeming conflict with the faith which was the sanction of the deed. It is worthy of notice that only at one moment of the drama does Antigone speak lightly of the penalty which she has deliberately incurred. That is at the moment when, face to face with Creon, she is asserting the superiority of the divine law. Nor does she, even then, speak lightly of death in itself; she only says that it is better than a life like hers; for at that moment she feels the whole burden of the sorrows which have fallen upon her race,&mdash;standing, as she does, before the man who has added the last woe. The tension of her mind is at the highest. But nowhere else does she speak as one who had sought death because weary of life; on the contrary, we can see that that life was dear to her, who must die young, &lsquo;without a portion in the chant that brings the bride.&rsquo; It is a perfectly sane mind which has chosen death, and has chosen it only because the alternative was to neglect a sacred duty.</p>
<p>A comparison with other dramatists may serve to illustrate what Sophocles has gained by thus allowing the temporary strength of excitement to pass off before the end, leaving the permanent strength of the character to wrestle with this pain and doubt. In Alfieri's play of the same name, Antigone shows no touch of human weakness; as death approaches, she seems more and more impatiently eager for it; she says to Creon's guards, who are leading her to her doom,&mdash;
<quote lang="en"><l>Let us make better speed; so slow a step </l>
<l>Ill becomes her who has at length just reach'd</l>
<l>The goal so long desired... Perhaps ye, O guards,</l>
<l>May feel compassion for my fate?... Proceed.</l>
<l>Oh terrible Death, I look thee in the face,</l>
<l>And yet I tremble not<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="1" resp="RCJ">C. Taylor's translation.</note>.</l></quote></p>
<p>In Massinger's <title>Virgin Martyr</title>, again, consider the strain in which Dorothea addresses Theophilus, the persecutor of the Christians, who has doomed her to torture and death:&mdash;
<quote lang="en"><l>Thou fool!</l>
<l>That gloriest in having power to ravish</l>
<l>A trifle from me I am weary of,</l>
<l>What is this life to me? Not worth a thought;</l>
<l>Or, if it be esteem'd, 'tis that I lose it</l>
<l>To win a better: even thy malice serves</l>
<l>To me but as a ladder to mount up</l>
<l>To such a height of happiness, where I shall</l>
<l>Look down with scorn on thee and on the world.</l></quote></p>
<p>The dramatic effect of such a tone, both in Alfieri's Antigone and in Massinger's Dorothea, is to make their fate not more, but less, pathetic; we should feel for them more if they, on their part, seemed to feel a little &lsquo;what 'tis to die, and to die young,&rsquo;&mdash; as Theophilus says to Dorothea. On the other hand, M. Casimir Delavigne, in his <title>Mess&eacute;niennes</title>, is Sophoclean where he describes the last moments of Joan of Arc:
<quote lang="fr"><l>Du Christ, avec l'ardeur, Jeanne baisait l'image;</l>
<l>Ses longs cheveux &eacute;pars flottaient au gr&eacute; des vents:</l>

<p>So it is that the Antigone of Sophocles, in the last scene of her life, feels her heart fail, bows her head, and weeps; but the first verse of the passage just quoted suggests a difference which makes the Greek maiden the more tragic figure of the two: when Antigone looked to heaven, she could find no certain comfort.</p>
<p>Thus has Sophocles created a true heroine; no fanatic enamoured of martyrdom, no virago, but a true woman, most tender-hearted, most courageous and steadfast; whose sense of duty sustains her in doing a deed for which she knows that she must die;&mdash;when it has been done, and death is at hand, then, indeed, there is a brief cry of anguish from that brave and loving spirit; it is bitter to die thus: but human sympathy is denied to her, and even the gods seem to have hidden their faces. Nowhere else has the poetry of the ancient world embodied so lofty or so beautiful an ideal of woman's love and devotion. The Macaria of Euripides resigns her life to save the race of the Heracleidae; his Iphigeneia, to prosper the course of the Greek fleet; his Alcestis, to save the life of her husband. In each of these cases, a divine voice had declared that some one must die; in each, the heroism required was purely passive; and in each a definite gain was promised,&mdash;for it was at least a pious opinion in the wife of Admetus (when all his other friends had declined his request that some of them would oblige him by dying for him)<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="2" resp="RCJ">Has the total absence of the sense of humour, in its disastrous effect upon tragic pathos, ever been more wonderfully illustrated than by Euripides in those lines of the <title>Alcestis?</title>&mdash;<cit><quote lang="greek"><lg type="trimeter"><l>pa/ntas d' e)le/gcas kai\ diecelqw\n fi/lous,</l>

Not one of these Euripidean heroines, pathetic though they be, can for a moment be ranked with Fedalma in George Eliot's <title>Spanish Gypsy</title>, when she accepts what seems worse than death for the sake of benefits to her race which are altogether doubtful;&mdash; <quote lang="en"><l>&lsquo;my soul is faint&mdash;</l>
<l>Will these sharp pains buy any certain good?&rsquo;</l></quote></p>
<p>But Antigone is greater than Fedalma. There was no father, no Zarca, at Antigone's side, urgently claiming the sacrifice,&mdash; on the contrary, there was a sister protesting against it; Antigone's choice was wholly free; the heroism which it imposed was one of doing as well as suffering; and the sole reward was to be in the action itself.
</p></div2>
<div2 id="ci1s15" type="section" n="15">
<p>The character of Creon, as Sophocles draws it in this<note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Creon.</note> play, may be regarded in somewhat different lights. It is interesting, then, to inquire how the poet meant it to be read. According to one view, Creon is animated by a personal spite against both Polyneices and Antigone; his maxims of statepolicy are mere pretexts. This theory seems mistaken. There is, indeed, one phrase which might suggest previous dissensions between Creon and Antigone (<bibl n="Soph. Ant. 562">v. 562</bibl>). It is also true that Creon is supposed to have sided with Eteocles when Polyneices was driven into exile. But Sophocles was too good a dramatist to lay stress on such motives in such a situation. Rather, surely, Creon is to be conceived as entirely sincere and profoundly earnest when he sets forth the public grounds of his action. They are briefly these. Anarchy is the worst evil that can befall a State: the first duty of a ruler is therefore to enforce law and maintain order. The safety of the individual depends on that of the State, and therefore every citizen has a direct interest in obedience. This obedience must be absolute and unquestioning. The ruler must be obeyed &lsquo;in little things and great, in just things <emph>and unjust</emph>&rsquo; (<bibl n="Soph. Ant. 667">v. 667</bibl>). That is, the subject must never presume to decide for himself what commands may be neglected or resisted. By rewarding the loyal and punishing the disloyal, a ruler will promote such obedience.</p>
<p>Creon puts his case with lucidity and force. We are reminded<note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Comparison with Plato's <title>Crito.</title></note> of that dialogue in which Plato represents Socrates, on the eve of execution, as visited in prison by his aged friend Crito, who comes to tell him that the means of escape have been provided, and to urge that he should use them. Socrates imagines the Laws of Athens remonstrating with him:  &lsquo;Do you imagine that a State can subsist, in which the decisions of law are set aside by individuals?&rsquo; And to the plea that &lsquo;unjust&rsquo; decisions may be disobeyed, the Laws rejoin,&mdash;&lsquo;Was <emph>that</emph> our agreement with you? Or were you to abide by the sentence of the State?&rsquo; When Antigone appeals to the laws of Hades (<bibl n="Soph. Ant. 451">v. 451</bibl>), might not Creon's laws, then, say to her what the laws of Athens say with regard to the hypothetical flight of Socrates:&mdash;&lsquo;We shall be angry with you while you live, and our brethren, the Laws in the world below, will receive you as an enemy; for they will know that you have done your best to destroy us&rsquo;?</p>
<p>Plato, it has been truly said, never intended to answer the question of casuistry, as to when, if ever, it is right to break the city's law. But at least there is one broad difference between the cases supposed in the <title>Crito</title> and the <title>Antigone.</title> Antigone had a positive religious duty, about which there was no doubt at all, and with which Creon's law conflicted. For Socrates to break prison might be justifiable, but could not be described as a positive religious duty; since, however much good he might feel confident of effecting by preserving his life, he was at least morally entitled to think that such good would be less than the evil of the example. Creon is doing what, in the case of Socrates, Athens did not do,&mdash;he is invading the acknowledged province of religion. Not that he forgets the existence of the gods: he reveres them in what he believes to be the orthodox way<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="1" resp="RCJ">See especially the note <ref target="cl1044" targOrder="U">on 1044</ref>.</note>. But he assumes that under no imaginable circumstances can the gods disapprove of penalties inflicted on a disloyal citizen. Meanwhile his characteristic tendency &lsquo;to do everything too much&rsquo; has led him into a step which renders this assumption disastrous. He punishes Polyneices in a manner which violates religion.</p>
<p>In Antigone, again, <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Creon's attitude towards Antigone</note>he sees anarchy personified, since, having disobeyed, she seems to glory therein (<bibl n="Soph. Ant. 482">v. 482</bibl>). Her defence is unmeaning to him, for her thoughts move in a different region from his own. Sophocles has brought this out with admirable skill in a short dialogue between Creon and Antigone (<bibl n="Soph. Ant. 508">508-525</bibl>): we see that he cannot get beyond his principle of State rewards and punishments; she is speaking foolishness to him&mdash; as, indeed, from the first she had felt the hopelessness of their understanding each other (<bibl n="Soph. Ant. 469">469 f.</bibl>, <bibl n="Soph. Ant. 499">499 f.</bibl>). As this dialogue serves to show Creon's unconsciousness of the frontier between divine and human law, so his scene with Haemon brings out his incapacity to appreciate the other great motive of Antigone's conduct,&mdash;sisterly piety. Creon regards the Family almost exclusively in one aspect; for him it is an institution related to the State as the gymnasium to the stadium; it is a little State, in which a man may prove that he is fit to govern a larger one.</p>
<p>Creon's temper is hasty and vehement. He vows that Haemon &lsquo;shall not save those two girls from their doom&rsquo;; but, when the Chorus pleads for Ismene, he quickly adds that he will spare <emph>her</emph>,&mdash;&lsquo;thou sayest well&rsquo; (<bibl n="Soph. Ant. 770">770 f.</bibl>). We also notice his love of hyperbole (<bibl n="Soph. Ant. 1039">1039 ff.</bibl>). But he is not malevolent. He represents the rigour of human law,&mdash;neither restricted by the sense of a higher law, nor intensified by a personal desire to hurt. He has the ill-regulated enthusiasm of a somewhat narrow understanding for the only principle which it has firmly grasped.
</p></div2>
<div2 id="ci1s16" type="section" n="16">
<p>Such, then, are the general characteristics which mark the treatment of this subject by Sophocles. In a drama of rare poetical beauty, and of especially fine psychology, he has raised the question as to the limit of the State's authority over the individual conscience. It belongs to the essence of the tragic pathos that this question is one which can never be answered by a set formula. Enough for Antigone that she finds herself in a situation where conscience leaves her no choice but to break one of two laws, and to die.</p>
<p>These distinctive qualities of the play may be illustrated by a glance at the work of some other poets. The <title>Antigone</title> of Euripides is now represented only by a few small fragments,<note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Euripides.</note> and its plot is uncertain. It would seem, however, that, when Antigone was caught in the act of burial, Haemon was assisting her, and that the play ended, not with her death, but with her marriage<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="1" resp="RCJ">All that we know as to the plot is contained in the <ref target="hyp1" targOrder="U">first Argument</ref> to this play: &lsquo;The story has been used also by Euripides in his <title>Antigone</title>; only there she is detected with Haemon, and is given in marriage, and bears a son Maion.&rsquo; In the scholia at the end of L we also read, &lsquo;this play differs from the <title>Antigone</title> of Euripides in the fact that, there, she was detected through the love of Haemon, and was given in marriage; while here the issue is the contrary&rsquo; (i.e. her death). That this is the right rendering of the scholiast's words&mdash; <quote lang="greek">fwraqei=sa e)kei/nh dia\ to\n *ai(/monos e)/rwta e)cedo/qh pro\s ga/mon</quote>&mdash;seems probable from a comparison with the statement in the Argument; though others have understood, &lsquo;she was detected, and, owing to the love of Haemon, given in marriage.&rsquo; She was detected, not, as in the play of Sophocles, directly by Creon's guards, but (in some way not specified) through the fact that Haemon's love for her had drawn him to her side. Welcker (<title>Griech. Trag.</title> II. pp. 563 ff.) has sought to identify the <title>Antigone</title> of Euripides with the plot sketched by Hyginus in <bibl n="Hyg. Fab. 72"><title>Fab.</title> 72</bibl>. Antigone having been detected, Haemon had been commissioned by Creon to slay her, but had saved her, conveying her to a shepherd's home. When Maion, the son of their secret marriage, had grown to man's estate, he visited Thebes at a festival. This was the moment (Welcker thinks) at which the <title>Antigone</title> of Euripides began. Creon noted in Maion a certain mark which all the offspring of the dragon's seed (<quote lang="greek">spartoi/</quote>) bore on their bodies. Haemon's disobedience was thus revealed; Heracles vainly interceded with Creon; Haemon slew his wife Antigone and then himself. But surely both the author of the Argument and the scholiast clearly imply that the marriage of Antigone was contained in the play of Euripides, and formed its conclusion. I therefore agree with Heydemann (<bibl><title lang="de">&Uuml;ber eine nacheuripideische Antigone</title>, Berlin, 1868</bibl>) that Hyginus was epitomising some otherwise unknown play. M. Patin (<bibl><title lang="fr">&Eacute;tudes sur les Tragiques grecs</title>, vol. II. p. 277</bibl>) remarks that there is nothing to show whether the play of Euripides was produced before or after that of Sophocles. But he has overlooked a curious and decisive piece of evidence. Among the scanty fragments of the Euripidean <title>Antigone</title> are these lines (<bibl>Eur. fr. 165, Nauck</bibl>); &mdash;<quote lang="greek">a)/kouson: ou) ga\r oi( kakw=s peprago/tes &verbar; su\n tai=s tu/xaisi tou\s lo/gous a)pw/lesan</quote>.

(For similar instances of covert criticism, see n. on <bibl n="Soph. OC 1116"><title>O. C.</title> 1116</bibl>.)</note>. Some of the fragments confirm the belief that the <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Attius.</note>love-motive was prominent<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="2" resp="RCJ"><bibl>Eur. fr. 160, 161, 162 (Nauck)</bibl>. The most significant is fr. 161, probably spoken by Haemon:&mdash;<quote lang="greek">h)/rwn: to\ mai/nesqai d' a)/r' h=)n e)/rws brotoi=s</quote>.&mdash;Another very suggestive fragment is no. 176, where the speaker is evidently remonstrating with Creon:&mdash; &lsquo;Who shall pain a rock by thrusting at it with a spear? And who can pain the dead by dishonour, if we grant that they have no sense of suffering?&rsquo; This is characteristic of the difference between the poets. Sophocles never urges the <emph>futility</emph> of Creon's vengeance, though he does touch upon its ignobleness (<bibl n="Soph. Ant. 1030">v. 1030</bibl>).</note>.

Statius, in<note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Statius.</note> his epic <title>Thebaid</title>, departs widely from the Attic version of the story. Argeia, the widow of Polyneices, meets Antigone by night at the corpse. Each, unknown to the other, has come to do the same task; both are put to death by Creon,&mdash; <quote lang="la">;ambae hilares et mortis amore superbae</quote><note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="2" resp="RCJ"><bibl n="Stat.

This rapturous welcoming of death is, as we have seen, quite in the manner of Massinger and Alfieri, but not at all in that of Sophocles.</p>
<p>Alfieri's <title>Antigone</title> (published in <date value="1783">1783</date>) follows Statius in <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Alfieri.</note> associating Argeia with Antigone; besides whom there are only two other actors, Creon and Haemon. The Italian poet has not improved upon the Greek. There are here two heroines, with very similar parts, in performing which they naturally utter very similar sentiments. Then Alfieri's Creon is not merely a perverse despot of narrow vision, but a monster of wickedness, who, by a thought worthy of Count Cenci, has published the edict for the express purpose of enticing Antigone into a breach of it. Having doomed her to die, he then offers to pardon her, if she will marry his son (and so unite the royal line with his own); but Antigone, though she esteems Haemon, declines to marry the son of such a parent. So she is put to death, while Argeia is sent back to Argos; and Haemon kills himself. It is not altogether unprofitable to be reminded, by such examples, what the theme of Sophocles could become in other hands.

<p>A word may be added regarding treatments of the <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Vasepaintings.</note> subject in works of art, which are not without some points of literary interest. Baumeister reproduces two vase-paintings, both curious<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="3" resp="RCJ"><title>Denkm&auml;ler</title>, pp. 83 f.</note>. The first<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="4" resp="RCJ">From Gerhard, <title>Ant. Bildw.</title> Taf. 73.</note> represents a group of three figures,&mdash;the central figure being an old man who has just doffed the mask of a young maiden,&mdash;while a guard, spear in hand, seizes him by the neck. This is explained as a comic parody of Antigone's story; she has sent an old servant to perform the task in her stead, and he, when confronted with Creon, drops his disguise. The other vase-painting<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="1" resp="RCJ"><bibl><title>Mon. Inst.</title> X. 27.</bibl></note>,&mdash;of perhaps <dateRange from="-380" to="-300">c. 380-300 B.C.</dateRange>,&mdash;represents Heracles interceding with Creon, who is on the hero's right hand, while Antigone and Haemon are on his left. Eurydic&egrave;, Ismene, and a youth (perhaps Maion, the offspring of Antigone's marriage with Haemon) are also present. Kl&uuml;gmann<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="2" resp="RCJ"><title>Ann. Inst.</title> 176, 1876.</note> refers this picture to the lost play of Euripides. Heydemann<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="3" resp="RCJ">See footnote above, p. xxxviii, note 1 (3rd paragraph).</note> (with more probability, I think) supposes it to represent a scene from an otherwise unknown drama, of which he recognises the plot in Hyginus (<bibl n="Hyg. Fab. 72"><title>Fab.</title> 72</bibl>). It is briefly this:&mdash;Haemon has disobeyed Creon by saving Antigone's life; Heracles intercedes with Creon for Haemon, but in vain; and the two lovers commit suicide. Professor Rhousopoulos, of Athens, in a letter to the French Academy<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="4" resp="RCJ"><quote lang="greek">*peri\ ei)ko/nos *)antigo/nhs kata\ a)rxai=on o)/strakon, meta\ a)peikoni/smatos</quote>.

The fragment shows the beautiful face of a maiden,&mdash;the eyes bent earnestly on some object which lies before her. This object has perished with the rest of the vase. But the letters <quote lang="greek">*e*i*k*h*s</quote> remain; and it is certain that the body of Polyneices was the sight on which the maiden was gazing. As Prof. Rhousopoulos ingeniously shows, the body must have been depicted as resting on sloping ground,&mdash; the lowest slope, we may suppose, of the hill upon which the guards sat (<bibl n="Soph. Ant. 411">v. 411</bibl>). The moment imagined by the artist may have been that at which Antigone returned, to find that the body had been again stripped of dust (<bibl n="Soph. Ant. 426">v. 426</bibl>). The women of ancient Thebes are said to have been distinguished for stature no less than beauty; and the artist of the vase appears to have given Antigone both characteristics.

	<p>It is not however, in the form of painting or of sculpture that Art has furnished the <title>Antigone</title> with its most famous and most delightful illustration. Two generations have now been so accustomed to associate this play with the music of Mendelssohn that at least a passing notice is due to<note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Mendelssohn.</note> the circumstances under which that music was composed; circumstances which, at a distance of nearly half a century, possess a peculiar interest of their own for these later days of classical revivals. After Frederick William IV. had come to the Prussian throne in <date value="1840-6-">June, 1840</date>, one of his first acts was to found at Berlin the Academy of Arts for Painting, Sculpture, Architecture, and Music; Mendelssohn, who was then thirty-two, became the first Director of the department of Music, in the spring of <date value="1841">1841</date>. The King had conceived the wish to revive some of the masterpieces of Greek Tragedy,&mdash; a project which the versatile poet Tieck, then on the confines of old age, encouraged warmly; none the less so, it would seem, because his own youth had been so vigorously identified with the protests of the Romantic school against classical restraint. Donner had recently published his German translation of Sophocles, &lsquo;in the metres of the original,&rsquo; and the <title>Antigone</title> was chosen for the experiment. Mendelssohn accepted with enthusiasm the task of writing the music. The rapidity with which he worked may be estimated from the fact that <date value="1841-09-09">Sept. 9, 1841</date>, seems to have been about the date at which Tieck first broached the idea to him, and that the first full stage rehearsal took place some six weeks later,&mdash;on <date value="1841-10-22">October 22nd</date>. The success of the music in Germany seems to have been immediate and great; rather more than could be said of the first performance in London, when the <title>Antigone</title>, with the new music, was brought out at Covent Garden, on <date value="1845-01-02">Jan. 2, 1845</date>. The orchestra on that occasion, indeed, had a conductor no less able than the late Sir G Macfarren; but the Chorus was put on the stage in a manner of which a graphic memorial has been preserved to us<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="1" resp="RCJ">On <date value="1845-03-25">March 25, 1845</date>, Mendelssohn wrote to his sister:&mdash;&lsquo;See if you cannot find <title>Punch</title> for <date value="1845-01-18">Jan. 18 [1845]</date>. It contains an account of Antigone at Covent Garden, with illustrations,&mdash;especially a view of the Chorus which has made me laugh for three days.&rsquo; In his excellent article on Mendelssohn in the <title>Dictionary of Music</title>, Sir G. Grove has justly deemed this picture worthy of reproduction.</note>. It may be added that the Covent Garden stage-manager improved the opportunity of the joyous &lsquo;dance-song&rsquo; to Dionysus (<bibl n="Soph. Ant. 1115">vv. 1115-1154</bibl>) by introducing a regular ballet.</p>
<p>To most lovers of music Mendelssohn's <title>Antigone</title> is too familiar to permit any word of comment here; but it may perhaps be less superfluous to remark a fact which has been brought under the writer's notice by an accomplished scholar<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="1" resp="RCJ">Mr George Wotherspoon, who has practically demonstrated the point by setting the Greek words to the music for the Parodos (<bibl n="Soph. Ant. 100">vv. 100-161</bibl>). It is only in the last antistrophe, he observes, that the &lsquo;phrasing&rsquo; becomes distinctly modern, and less attentive to the Greek rhythms than to harmonic effects.</note>. For the most part, the music admits of having the Greek words set to it in a way which shows that Mendelssohn, while writing for Donner's words, must have been guided by something more than Donner's imitation of the Greek metres; he must also have been attentive, as a general rule, to the Greek text.

	<p>The question as to the date <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Date of the play.</note> of the <title>Antigone</title> has a biographical no less than a literary interest. It is probable that the play was first produced at the Great Dionysia towards the end of <date value="-441-03">March, 441 B.C.</date> This precise date is, indeed, by no means certain; but all the evidence indicates that, at any rate, the years <dateRange from="-442" to="-441">442 and 441 B.C.</dateRange> give the probable limits. According to the author of the <ref target="hyp1" targOrder="U">first Argument</ref> to the play, the success of the <title>Antigone</title> had led to Sophocles obtaining the office of general, which he held in an expedition against Samos.  Athens sent two expeditions to Samos in <date value="-440">440 B.C.</date> (1) The occasion of the first expedition was as follows. Samos and Miletus had been at war for the possession of Prien&egrave;, a place on the mainland not far from Miletus. The Milesians, having been worsted, denounced the Samians to the Athenians; who required that both parties should submit their case at Athens. This the Samians refused to do. The Athenians then sent forty ships to Samos,&mdash;put down the oligarchy there,&mdash;and established a democracy in its place<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="3" resp="RCJ">The Greek life of Sophocles says that he served as general &lsquo;in the war against the Anaeans&rsquo; (<quote lang="greek">a)nai/ous</quote>). Anaea was a place on the mainland, near Prien&egrave;. Boeckh supposes that the first expedition was known as &lsquo;the Anaean war,&rsquo; and that Sophocles took part in it as well as in the second expedition. To me, I confess, there seems to be far more probability in the simple supposition that <quote lang="greek">a)nai/ous</quote> is a corruption of <quote lang="greek">sami/ous</quote>.</note>. (2) The second expedition had to deal with Samos in open rebellion. The Samian oligarchs had come back,&mdash;overthrown the new democracy,&mdash;and proclaimed a revolt from Athens, in which Byzantium joined. Pericles was one of the ten generals for the year. He sailed at once to Samos, with sixty ships. All his nine colleagues went with him. When they reached Samos, sixteen of the sixty ships were detached on special service,&mdash;partly to watch the Carian coast, partly to summon aid from the two great islands to the<note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">The strategia of Sophocles.</note> north, Chios and Lesbos. Sophocles, who was one of the ten generals, was sent on the mission to these islands.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I met Sophocles, the poet, at Chios, when he was sailing as general to Lesbos.&rsquo; These are the words of  Ion, the poet and prose-writer&mdash;who was only some twelve years younger than Sophocles&mdash;in a fragment preserved by Athenaeus<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="1" resp="RCJ">p. 603 <bibl>E. Miller, <title>Frag. Hist.</title> II. 46.</bibl></note>. The occasion of the meeting was a dinner given to Sophocles at Chios by Hermesilaus, a friend of his who acted as Athenian &lsquo;proxenus&rsquo; there. Now, there is not the smallest real ground for questioning the genuineness of this fragment<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="2" resp="RCJ">Arguments against the genuineness have been brought, indeed, by  Ritter  Fr.(<bibl><title lang="de">Vorgebliche Strategie d. Sophokles gegen Samos:</title> Rhein. Mus., 1843, pp. 187 ff.</bibl>). (1) Ion represents Sophocles as saying,&mdash;<quote lang="greek">*periklh=s poiei=n me e)/fh, strathgei=n d' ou)k e)pi/stasqai</quote>. Sophocles (Ritter argues) would have said <quote lang="greek">fhsi/</quote>, not <quote lang="greek">e)/fh</quote>, if Pericles had been alive. The forger of the fragment intended it to refer to the revolt of Lesbos in <date value="-428">428 B.C.</date>,&mdash;forgetting that Sophocles would then be 78. But we reply:&mdash;The tense, <quote lang="greek">e)/fh</quote>, can obviously refer to the particular occasion on which the remark was made: &lsquo;Pericles <emph>said</emph> so [when I was appointed, or when we were at Samos together].&rsquo; (2) Ion says of Sophocles, <quote lang="greek">ou) r(ekth/rios h=)n</quote>. This (says Ritter) implies that Sophocles was dead; who, however, long survived Ion. [Ion was dead in <date value="-421">421 B.C.</date>, <bibl n="Aristoph. Peace 835">Aristoph. <title>Pax</title> 835</bibl>.] But here, again, the tense merely refers to the time at which the writer received the impression. We could say of a living person, &lsquo;he was an agreeable man&rsquo;&mdash;meaning that we found him so when we met him.</note>. And its genuineness is confirmed by internal evidence. Sophocles said at the dinner-party,&mdash;alluding to a playful <emph>ruse</emph> by which he had amused the company,&mdash;that he was practising generalship, as Pericles had said that he was a better poet than general. The diplomatic mission to Chios and Lesbos was a service in which Pericles might very naturally utilize the abilities of his gifted, though unmilitary colleague. There is another trait which has not (to my knowledge) been noticed, but which seems worth remarking, as the coincidence is one which is not likely to have been contrived by a forger. It is casually mentioned that, at this dinner-party, an attendant was standing &lsquo;near the fire,&rsquo; and the couch of Sophocles, the chief guest, was also near it. The warm season, then, had not begun. Now we know that Pericles sailed for Samos early in 440 B.C., before the regular season for navigation had yet opened<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="1" resp="RCJ">See Curtius, <title>Hist. Gr.</title> II. 472 (Eng. tr.).</note>.</p>
<p>If the fragment of Ion is authentic, then it is certain that Sophocles held the strategia, and certain also that he held it in <date value="-440">440 B.C.</date>: for Ion's mention of Lesbos cannot possibly be referred to the revolt of that island from Athens in <date value="-428">428 B.C.</date>  Apart from the fragment of  Ion, however, there is good Attic authority for the tradition. Androtion, whose <title>Atthis</title> was written about <date value="-280">280 B.C.</date>, gave the names of the ten generals at Samos on this occasion. His list<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="2" resp="RCJ">This fragment of Androtion has been preserved by the schol. on Aristeides, vol. 3, p. 485 (Dind.). M&uuml;ller, <title>Frag. Hist.</title> IV. 645. The names of two of the ten generals are wanting in the printed texts, but have since been restored, from the MS., by Wilamowitz, <title>De Rhesi Scholiis</title>, P. 13 (Greifswald, 1877). I have observed a remarkable fact in regard to Androtion's list, which ought to be mentioned, because it might be urged against the authenticity of the list, though (in my opinion) such an inference from it would be unfair. Androtion gives (1) the names, (2) the demes of the Generals, but <emph>not</emph> their tribes. The regular order of precedence for the ten Cleisthenean tribes was this:&mdash; 1. Erectheis. 2. Aegeis. 3. Pandionis. 4. Leontis. 5. Acamantis. 6. Oeneis. 7. Cecropis. 8. Hippothontis. 9. Aeantis. 10. Antiochis. Now take the demes named by Androtion. His list will be found to follow this order of the ten tribes,&mdash; with one exception, and it is in the case of Sophocles. His deme, Colonus, belonged to the Antiochis, and therefore his name ought to have come last. But Androtion puts it second. The explanation is simple. When the ten tribes were increased to twelve, by the addition of the Antigonis and Demetrias (in or about <date value="-307">307 B.C.</date>), some of the demes were transferred from one tribe to another. Among these was the deme of Colonus. It was transferred from the Antiochis, the tenth on the roll, to the Aegeis, the second on the roll. Hence Androtion's order is correct for his own time (<date value="-280">c. 280 B.C.</date>), but not correct for <date value="-440">440 B.C.</date>  It is quite unnecessary, however, to infer that he invented or doctored the list. It is enough to suppose that he re-adjusted the order, so as to make it consistent in the eyes of his contemporaries.</note> includes Pericles, and &lsquo;Sophocles, the poet, of Colonus.&rsquo;</p>

<div2 id="ci1s20" type="section" n="20">
	<p>We have next to ask,&mdash;What ground is there for connecting<note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Had the play any bearing upon the poet's appointment?</note>  this strategia of Sophocles with the production of his <title>Antigone</title>?  The authority for such a connection is the <ref target="hyp1" targOrder="U">first Argument</ref> to the play. This is ascribed to Aristophanes of Byzantium (<date value="-200">c. 200 B.C.</date>), but is more probably of later origin. It says;&mdash;&lsquo;They say (<quote lang="greek">fasi/</quote>) that Sophocles was appointed to the strategia which he held at Samos, because he had distinguished himself by the production of the <title>Antigone.</title>&rsquo; Here, as so often elsewhere, the phrase, &lsquo;they say,&rsquo; is not an expression of doubt, but an indication that the story was found in several writers. We know the names of at least two writers in whose works such a tradition would have been likely to occur. One of them is Satyrus (<date value="-200">c. 200 B.C.</date>), whose collection of biographies was used by the author of the Life of Sophocles<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="2" resp="RCJ">See Introduction to the <title>Oed. Col.</title>, &sect; 18, p. xli. J. S. III.3</note>; the other&mdash;also quoted in the Life&mdash;is Carystius of Pergamum, who lived about <date value="-110">110 B.C.</date>, and wrote a book, <quote lang="greek">*peri\ didaskaliw=n</quote>&mdash;&lsquo;Chronicles of the Stage&rsquo;&mdash;which Athenaeus cites. At the time when these works &mdash;and there were others of a similar kind&mdash;were compiled, old and authentic lists of Athenian plays, with their dates, appear to have been extant in such libraries as those of Alexandria and Pergamum. When, therefore, we meet with a tradition,&mdash;dating at least from <dateRange from="-200" to="-100">the second century B.C.</dateRange>,&mdash;which affirms that the strategia of Sophocles was due to his <title>Antigone</title>, one inference, at least, is fairly secure. We may believe that the <title>Antigone</title> was known to have been produced earlier than the summer of <date value="-441">441 B.C.</date> For, if Sophocles was strategus in the early spring of <date value="-440">440 B.C.</date>, he must have been elected in <date value="-441-05">May, 441 B.C.</date> The election of the ten strategi was held annually, at the same time as the other official elections (<quote lang="greek">a)rxairesi/ai</quote>), in the month of Thargelion, at the beginning of the ninth prytany of the civic year. Further, we may conclude that the <title>Antigone</title> had not been produced at any long interval before <date value="-441-05">May, 441 B.C.</date> Otherwise the tradition that the play had influenced the election&mdash;whether it really did so or not&mdash;would not have seemed probable.</p>
	<p>Assuming, then, that the <title>Antigone</title> was brought out not long before Sophocles obtained the strategia, we have still to consider whether there is any likelihood in the story that his election was influenced by the success of the play. At first sight, a modern reader is apt to be reminded of the man of letters who, in the opinion of his admirer, would have been competent, at the shortest notice, to assume command of the Channel Fleet. It may appear grotesque that an important State should have rewarded poetical genius by a similar appointment. But here, as in other cases, we must endeavour to place ourselves at the old Athenian point of view. The word &lsquo;general,&rsquo; by which we render &lsquo;strategus,&rsquo; suggests functions purely military, requiring, for their proper discharge, an elaborate professional training. Such a conception of the Athenian strategia would not, however, be accurate. The ten strategi, chosen annually, formed a board of which the duties were primarily military, but also, in part, civil. And, for the majority of the ten, the military duties were usually restricted to the exercise of control and supervision at Athens. They resembled officials at the War Office, with some added functions from the province of the Home Office. The number of strategi sent out with an army or a fleet was, at this period, seldom more than three. It was only in grave emergencies that all the ten strategi went on active service together. In <date value="-441-05">May, 441 B.C.</date>,&mdash;the time, as it seems, when Sophocles was elected,&mdash;no one could have foreseen the great crisis at Samos. In an ordinary year Sophocles, as one of the strategi, would not necessarily have been required to leave Athens. Among his nine colleagues there were doubtless, besides Pericles, one or two more possessed of military aptitudes, who would have sufficed to perform any ordinary service in the field. Demosthenes&mdash;in whose day only one of the ten strategi was ordinarily commissioned for war&mdash;describes the other nine as occupied, among other things, with arranging the processions for the great religious festivals at Athens<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="1" resp="RCJ"><bibl n="Dem. 4.26">Dem. or. 4 &sect; 26</bibl>.</note>. He deplores, indeed, that they should be so employed; but it is certain that it had long been one duty of these high officials to help in organising the great ceremonies. We are reminded how suitable such a sphere of duty would have been for Sophocles,&mdash;who is said to have led in his boyhood the Chorus that celebrated the victory of Salamis,&mdash;and we seem to win a new light on the meaning of his appointment to the strategia. In so far as a strategus had to do with public ceremonies and festivals, a man with the personal gifts of Sophocles could hardly have strengthened his claim better than by a brilliant success at the Dionysia. The mode of election was favourable to such a man. It was by show of hands in the Ecclesia. If the <title>Antigone</title> was produced at the Great Dionysia, late in <date value="-441-03">March, 441 B.C.</date>, it is perfectly intelligible that the poet's splendid dramatic triumph should have contributed to his election in the following May. It is needless to suppose that his special fitness for the office was suggested to his fellow-citizens by the special maxims of administration which he ascribes to Creon,&mdash;a notion which would give an air of unreality,&mdash;verging, indeed, on comedy,&mdash;to a result which appears entirely natural when it is considered in a larger way<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="2" resp="RCJ">One of Aelian's anecdotes (<title>Var. Hist.</title> 3. 8) is entitled, <quote lang="greek">o(/ti o( *fru/nixos dia/ ti poi/hma strathgo\s h(|re/qh</quote>. Phrynichus, he says, &lsquo;having composed suitable songs for the performers of the war-dance (<quote lang="greek">purrixistai=s</quote>) in a tragedy, so captivated and enraptured the (Athenian) spectators, that they immediately elected him to a military command.&rsquo; Nothing else is known concerning this alleged strategia. It is possible that Phrynichus, the tragic poet of <date value="-500">c. 500 B.C.</date>, was confounded by some later anecdote-monger with the son of Stratonides, general in <date value="-412">412 B.C.</date> (<bibl n="Thuc. 8.25">Thuc. 8.25</bibl>), and that the story was suggested by the authentic strategia of Sophocles. At any rate, the vague and dubious testimony of Aelian certainly does not warrant us in using the case of Phrynichus as an illustration.</note>.

<p>The internal evidence of the <title>Antigone</title> confirms the<note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Internal evidence for an early date.</note> belief that it is the earliest of the extant seven. Certain traits of composition distinguish it. (1) The division of an iambic trimeter between two or more speakers&mdash;technically called <quote lang="greek">a)ntilabh/</quote>&mdash;is avoided, as it is by Aeschylus. It is admitted in the other six plays. (2) An anapaest nowhere holds the first place of the trimeter. It may further be noticed that the resolution of any foot of the trimeter is comparatively rare in the <title>Antigone.</title> Including the proper names, there are less than 40 instances. A considerably higher proportion is found in later plays. (3) The use made of anapaestic verse is archaistic in three points. (<emph>a</emph>) The Parodos contains regular anapaestic systems (see note on <ref target="cl100" targOrder="U">vv. 100-161</ref>). (<emph>b</emph>) The Chorus uses anapaests in announcing the entrance of Creon, Antigone, Ismene, Haemon. In the case of Ismene, these anapaests do not follow the stasimon, but occur in the midst of the epeisodion (see <bibl n="Soph. Ant. 526">vv. 526-530</bibl>). (<emph>c</emph>) Anapaests are also admitted, for purposes of dialogue, within an epeisodion (<bibl n="Soph. Ant. 929">vv. 929-943</bibl>, where the Chorus, Creon, and Antigone are the speakers). Aeschylus allowed this; but elsewhere it occurs only in the <title>Ajax</title> of Sophocles (another comparatively early play), and in the <title>Medea</title> of Euripides (<date value="-431">431 B.C.</date>).

	<p>The <ref target="hyp1" targOrder="U">first Argument</ref> <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Place of the play in the series of the poet's works.</note> ends by saying that the play &lsquo;has been reckoned as the thirty-second<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="1" resp="RCJ"><quote lang="greek">le/lektai de\ to\ dra=ma tou=to triakosto\n deu/teron</quote>. Bergk (<title>Hist. Gr. Lit.</title> III. p. 414) proposes to read, <quote lang="greek">dedi/daktai de\ to\ dra=ma tou=to triakosto/n: deu/teros h)=n</quote>. He assumes that Sophocles gained the second prize, because, according to the Parian Chronicle (60), the first prize was gained by Euripides in the archonship of Diphilus (<dateRange from="-442-08" to="-441-07">442/1 B.C.</dateRange>). He adds that the word <quote lang="greek">eu)dokimh/santa</quote>, applied to Sophocles in the Argument, would suit the winner of the second prize,&mdash;as Aristophanes says of his own <quote lang="greek">*daitalei=s</quote>, which gained the second prize, <cit><quote lang="greek">a)/rist' h)kousa/thn</quote> <bibl n="Aristoph. Cl. 529">(<title>Nub.</title> 529)</bibl></cit>. But two things are wanting to the probability of Bergk's conjecture, viz., (1) some independent reason for thinking that the <title>Antigone</title> was the 30th, rather than the 32nd, of its author's works; and (2) some better ground for assuming that it gained the second prize.</note>.&rsquo; This statement was doubtless taken from authentic <quote lang="greek">didaskali/ai</quote>&mdash;lists of performances, with their dates&mdash;which had come down from the 5th century B.C. to the Alexandrian age. The notice has a larger biographical interest than can often be claimed for such details. In <date value="-441">441 B.C.</date> Sophocles was fifty-five: he died in <dateRange from="-406-08" to="-405-07">406/5 B.C.</dateRange>, at ninety or ninety-one. More than 100 lost plays of his are known by name: the total number of his works might be roughly estimated at 110. It appears warrantable to assume that Sophocles had produced his works by tetralogies,&mdash;i.e., three tragedies and one satyric drama on each occasion. If the number 32 includes the satyric dramas, then the <title>Antigone</title> was the fourth play of the eighth tetralogy, and Sophocles would have competed on seven occasions <dateRange from="-468" to="-441">before 441 B.C.</dateRange> He is recorded to have gained the first prize at his first appearance, in <date value="-468">468 B.C.</date>, when he was twenty-eight. The production of 28 plays in the next 27 years would certainly argue a fair measure of poetical activity. If, on the other hand, this 32 is exclusive of satyric dramas, then the <title>Antigone</title> was the second play of the eleventh trilogy, and the whole number of plays written by the poet from 468 to 441 B.C. (both years included) was 44.</p>
<p>On either view, then, we have this interesting result,&mdash;that the years of the poet's life from fifty-five to ninety were decidedly more productive than the years from twenty-eight to fifty-five. And if we suppose that the number 32 includes the satyric dramas&mdash;which seems the more natural view&mdash;then the ratio of increased fertility after the age of fifty-five becomes still more remarkable. We have excellent reason, moreover, for believing that this increase in amount of production was not attended by any deterioration of quality. The <title>Philoctetes</title> and the <title>Coloneus</title> are probably among the latest works of all. These facts entitle Sophocles to be reckoned among the most memorable instances of poetical genius prolonging its fullest vigour to extreme old age, and&mdash;what is perhaps rarer still&mdash;actually increasing its activity after middle life had been left behind.

<div2 id="ci1s23" type="section" n="23">
<p>Nothing is known as to the plays which Sophocles<note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">The Theban plays&mdash;not a connected trilogy.</note> may have produced along with the <title>Antigone.</title> Two forms of trilogy were in concurrent use down at least to the end of the fifth century,&mdash;that in which the three tragedies were parts of one story,&mdash;and that in which no such link existed. The former was usually (though doubtless not always) employed by Aeschylus; the latter was preferred by his younger rival. Thus it is possible,&mdash;nay, probable,&mdash;that the two tragedies which accompanied the <title>Antigone</title> were unrelated to it in subject. Even when the Theban plays of Sophocles are read in the order of the fable, they do not form a linked trilogy in the Aeschylean sense. This is not due merely to discrepancy of detail or incompleteness of juncture. The perversely rigorous Creon of the <title>Antigone</title> is, indeed, an essentially distinct character from the ruthless villain of the <title>Coloneus;</title> the <title>Coloneus</title> describes the end of Oedipus in a manner irreconcileable with the allusion in the <title>Antigone</title> (<bibl n="Soph. Ant. 50">v. 50</bibl>). But, if such differences existed between the <title>Choephori</title> and the <title>Eumenides</title>, they would not affect the solidarity of the &lsquo;Oresteia.&rsquo; On the other hand, it does not suffice to make the triad a compact trilogy that the <title>Tyrannus</title> is, in certain aspects, supplemented by the <title>Coloneus</title><note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="1" resp="RCJ">See Introd. to <title>Oed. Col.</title> p. xxi. &sect; 3.</note>, and that the latter is connected with the <title>Antigone</title> by finely-wrought links of allusion<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="2" resp="RCJ">See <bibl n="Soph. OC 1405"><title>Oed. Col.</title> 1405-1413</bibl>, and <bibl n="Soph. OC 1770">1770-1772</bibl>.</note>. In nothing is the art of Sophocles more characteristically seen than in the fact that each of these three masterpieces&mdash;with their common thread of fable, and with all their particular affinities&mdash;is still, dramatically and morally, an independent whole.

<div2 id="ci2s1" type="section" n="1">
<p>In this play, as in the others, the editor has used the Autotype<note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">The Laurentian MS (L).</note> Facsimile of L (published by the London Hellenic Society in <date value="1885">1885</date>); and, with its aid, has endeavoured to render the report of that manuscript as complete and exact as possible. In some instances, where discrepancies existed between previous collations, the facsimile has served to resolve the doubt; in a few other cases, it has availed to correct errors which had obtained general currency: the critical notes on 311, 375, 770, 1098, 1280 will supply examples.</p>
<p>The MSS., besides L, to which reference is made, are:&mdash;A (13th<note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Other MSS.</note> cent.), E (ascribed to 13th cent., but perhaps of the 14th), T (15th cent.), V (late 13th or early 14th), V2 (probably 14th), with the following 14th century MSS.,&mdash;V3, V4,  Vat.,   Vat.b, L2, R. Some account of these has been given in the Introduction to the <title>Oedipus Tyrannus;</title> cp. also the Introd. to the <title>Oed. Col.</title> p. xlix. A few references are also made to an Augsburg MS. (Aug. b, 14th cent.), to Dresd. a (cod. 183, 14th cent.), and to M4 (Milan, Ambrosian Library, cod. C. 24 sup., 15th cent.). The symbol &lsquo;r&rsquo; is occasionally used in the critical notes to denote &lsquo;one or more of the MSS. other than L&rsquo;. The advantages of such a symbol are twofold: (1) the note can often be made shorter and simpler; (2) the paramount importance of L is thus more clearly marked, and, so far, the relative values of the documents are presented to the reader in a truer perspective. But this symbol has been employed only in those cases where no reason existed for a more particular statement.

<p>The <title>Antigone</title> furnishes three instances in which the older scholia<note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Readings due to the Scholia.</note> do what they rarely do for the text of Sophocles,&mdash;give a certain clue to a true reading which all the MSS. have lost. One is <quote lang="greek">'fa/ptousa</quote> in <bibl n="Soph. Ant. 40">v. 40</bibl>; another, <quote lang="greek">fonw/saisin</quote> in <bibl n="Soph.

<div2 id="ci2s3" type="section" n="3">
<p>Again, <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Points bearing on the relation of L to the other MSS.</note> this play presents some points of curious interest in regard to the much-discussed question whether L is the source from which all other known MSS. of Sophocles have been derived.</p>
<p>(1) There are two places in which an apparently true reading has been preserved by some of the later MSS., while L has an apparently false one. The first example is in <bibl n="Soph. Ant. 386">v. 386</bibl>, where L has <quote lang="greek">ei)s me/son</quote>, while A and others have <quote lang="greek">ei)s de/on</quote>. Some editors, indeed, prefer <quote lang="greek">ei)s me/son</quote>: but A's reading seems far preferable (see comment.). The other example is clearer. In <bibl n="Soph. Ant. 831">v. 831</bibl> L has <quote lang="greek">ta/kei</quote>, a manifest error, occasioned by <quote lang="greek">takome/nan</quote> shortly before. The true reading, <quote lang="greek">te/ggei</quote>, is in A and other of the MSS. later than L.</p>
<p>(2) Verse <bibl n="Soph. Ant. 1167">1167</bibl>, <quote lang="greek">zh=n tou=ton, a)ll' e)/myuxon h(gou=mai nekro/n</quote>, is in none of the MSS. It is supplied by Athenaeus 7. 280 C, who quotes <bibl n="Soph. Ant. 1165">vv. 1165-1171</bibl>. The earliest printed edition which contains it is that of Turnebus (Paris, <date value="1553">1553 A.D.</date>). Now Eustathius (p. 957. 17) quotes v. 1165 (partly) and v. 1166,&mdash;remarking that, after v. 1166, &lsquo;the careful copies&rsquo; (<quote lang="greek">ta\ a)kribh= a)nti/grafa</quote>) give the verse <quote lang="greek">zh=n tou=ton, a)ll' e)/myuxon h(gou=mai nekro/n</quote>. Eustathius wrote in the <dateRange from="1150" to="1200">second half of the 12th century</dateRange>: L was written in the <dateRange from="1000" to="1050">first half of the eleventh century</dateRange>. It would be a very forced explanation to suppose that Eustathius, in speaking of <quote lang="greek">ta\ a)kribh= a)nti/grafa</quote>, meant those MSS. of Sophocles on which Athenaeus, some 1000 years before, had relied for his quotation; or, again, those MSS. of Athenaeus in which Eustathius found it. According to the natural (or rather, the necessary) sense of the words, Eustathius is referring to MSS. of Sophocles extant in his own time. But did his memory deceive him, leading him to ascribe to MSS. of Sophocles what he had seen in Athenaeus? This, again, would be a very bold assumption. His statement has a <foreign lang="la">prima facie</foreign> claim to acceptance in its plain sense. And if his statement is accepted, it follows that, when L was written (in the first half of the eleventh century), two classes of MSS. of Sophocles could be distinguished by the presence or absence of verse 1167. But that verse is absent from every MS. of Sophocles now known. If, therefore, L was not the common parent of the rest, at any rate that parent (or parents) agreed with L in this striking defect, which (according to Eustathius) could have been corrected from other MSS. known in the twelfth century. There is no other instance in which a fault, now universal in the MSS. of Sophocles, is thus alleged to have been absent from a MS. or MSS. extant after the date at which L was written. Whatever construction may be placed on the statement of Eustathius, it is certain that it deserves to be carefully noted.

<div2 id="ci2s4" type="section" n="4">
<p>Another noteworthy fact is the unusually large number of<note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">The MSS. <foreign lang="la">versus</foreign> ancient citations.</note> passages in which the MSS. of the <title>Antigone</title> vary from the quotations made by ancient writers. In every one of these instances (I think) our MSS. are right, and the ancient citation is wrong: though there are some cases in which modern scholars have thought otherwise. See the critical notes on vv. 186, 203, 223 (with <ref target="cl223" targOrder="U">commentary</ref>), 241, 292 (with note in Appendix), 324, 456, 457, 563, 564, 678, 742, 911 f., 1037, 1167.
</p></div2>
<div2 id="ci2s5" type="section" n="5">
<p>Among the interpolations which modern criticism has suspected,<note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Interpolation.</note> there is one which is distinguished from the rest alike by extent and by importance. This is the passage, founded on <bibl n="Hdt. 3.119">Herodotus 3. 119</bibl>, in Antigone's last speech. I concur in the opinion of those who think that this passage,&mdash;i.e., <bibl n="Soph. Ant. 904">vv. 904-920</bibl>,&mdash;cannot have stood in the text as Sophocles left it. The point is one of vital moment for our whole conception of the play. Much has been written upon it; indeed, it has a small literature of its own; but I am not acquainted with any discussion of it which appears to me satisfactory. In a note in the Appendix I have attempted to state clearly the reasons for my belief, and to show how the arguments on the other side can be answered.</p>
<p>This is the only passage of the play which seems to afford solid ground for the hypothesis of interpolation. It is right, however, to subjoin a list of the verses which have been suspected by the critics whose names are attached to them severally. Many of these cases receive discussion in the notes; but there are others which did not require it, because the suspicion is so manifestly baseless. It will be seen that, if effect were given to all these indictments, the <title>Antigone</title> would suffer a loss of nearly 80 verses.

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">to\n *mai/ona</lemma>. This reading is made almost certain by the mention of &lsquo;Maion, son of Haemon&rsquo; in <bibl n="Hom. Il. 4.394"><title>Il.</title> 4.394</bibl>, coupled with the fact that L has <quote lang="greek">*mai/mona</quote> in the margin (see cr. n.). But the reading <quote lang="greek">meta\ tou= *ai(/monos</quote> just before is doubtful. If it is sound, then we must understand: &lsquo;having been discovered in company with Haemon, she was given in marriage (to him).&rsquo; But I am strongly inclined to think that the conjecture <quote lang="greek">meta\ tou=to tw=| *ai(/moni</quote> (which would explain the <foreign lang="la">v.l.</foreign> <quote lang="greek">tw=| *ai(/moni</quote>) is right. Dindorf differs from other interpreters in supposing that it was not Haemon, but someone else&mdash;perhaps a nameless <quote lang="greek">au)tourgo/s,</quote> as in the case of the Euripidean Electra&mdash;to whom Euripides married Antigone: and he reads <quote lang="greek">ti/ktei to\n *ai(/mona</quote>. We have then to suppose that Antigone marked her affection for her lost lover by giving his name to her son by the <quote lang="greek">au)tourgo/s</quote>. At the end of the scholia in L we find these words:&mdash;<quote lang="greek">*(/oti diafe/rei th=s *eu)ripi/dou *)antigo/nhs au(/th, o(/ti fwraqei=sa e)kei/nh dia\ to\n *ai(/monos e)/rwta e)cedo/qh pro\s ga/mon: e)ntau=qa de\ tou)nanti/on</quote>. The contrast meant is between her marriage in Euripides and her death in Sophocles: but the words obviously leave it doubtful whether the person to whom Euripides married her was Haemon or not.</p>

<p rend="ital">Scene:&mdash;The same as in the <title>Oedipus Tyrannus</title>,&mdash;viz., an open space before the royal palace (once that of Oedipus) at Thebes. The back-scene represents the front of the palace, with three doors, of which the central and largest (the <quote lang="greek">basi/leios qu/ra</quote>) is that which in <bibl n="Soph.

<p> Prologue. At daybreak (<bibl n="Soph.

She tells her that Creon has forbidden the burial of Polyneices, and declares her resolve to perform it herself. Ismene declines to assist, and endeavours to dissuade her. Antigone then goes alone to the task.

In the direct question, <quote lang="greek">ti/ o(poi=on ou) telei=</quote>; we understand <quote lang="greek">e)sti/</quote> with <quote lang="greek">ti/</quote>.

This, too, suggests the answer to the objection that <quote lang="greek">*zeu/s</quote> ought to follow <quote lang="greek">o(poi=on</quote>. Certainly <cit><bibl n="Eur. IA 525">Eur. <title>I.

<p> Paley (<title>Journ.

The descent of this metaphor is curious. <quote lang="greek">fur</quote>, the root of <quote lang="greek">por-fu/r-w</quote>, signified &lsquo;to be agitated,&rsquo;&mdash;like heaving water, for instance (Skt. <foreign lang="sanskrit">bhur</foreign>, Lat. <foreign lang="la">ferv-ere</foreign>, Curt. &sect; 415). In <bibl n="Hom.

An exception might, indeed, be supposed in Philo Judaeus <title>De Mose</title> 3, p. 692, where he is saying that the continuity of human record has been broken <quote lang="greek">dia\ ta\s e)n u(/dasi kai\ puri\ genome/nas sunexei=s kai\ e)pallh/lous fqora/s</quote>: which Adrian Turnebus rendered, <quote lang="la">propter illas eluvionum et exustionum continuas et <emph>alternas</emph> (&lsquo;mutual&rsquo;) interneciones.</quote> But Philo was evidently (I think) using <quote lang="greek">e)pa/llhlos</quote> in its ordinary sense, and meant merely, &lsquo;owing to <emph>the continuous and rapid succession</emph> of calamities by flood and fire.&rsquo; It by no means follows, however, that a poet of the 5th cent.

<p> Parodos. For the metres see Metrical Analysis. The framework is as follows. (1) 1<emph>st strophe</emph>, 100 <quote lang="greek">a)kti/s</quote> to 109 <quote lang="greek">xalinw=|</quote>=1<emph>st antistrophe</emph>, 117 <quote lang="greek">sta\s</quote> to 133 <quote lang="greek">a)lala/cai</quote>.

Each strophe and each antistrophe is followed by an anapaestic system (<quote lang="greek">su/sthma</quote>) of seven verses, recited by the Coryphaeus alone, in the pauses of the choral dance. The fourth and last of these systems, following the second antistrophe, announces the approach of Creon.</p>
<p>The <title>Ajax</title> is the only play of Sophocles which has a Parodos beginning, in the older style, with a regular anapaestic march. But something of the same character is given to this ode by the regularity of the anapaestic systems. In the Parodos of the <bibl n="Soph. OC"><title>O. C.</title></bibl>, on the other hand, though anapaests similarly divide each strophe from each antistrophe, the systems are of unequal lengths, and the general character is wholly different, being rather that of a <quote lang="greek">kommo/s</quote>: see n. on <bibl n="Soph. OC 117"><title>O. C.</title> 117</bibl>.</p>
<p>The fifteen Theban elders who form the Chorus have been summoned to the palace by Creon,&mdash;they know not, as yet, for what purpose (158). They greet the newly-risen sun, and exult in the flight of the Argives.</p>
<p>The ode vividly portrays the enormous sin of Polyneices against his country, and the appalling nature of the peril which Thebes has just escaped. We already know Antigone's motive. This is a dramatic prelude to the announcement of Creon's.

<p> The MSS. have <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">o(\n...*polunei/khs</lemma>. If this were sound, it would be necessary to suppose that after <quote lang="greek">a)mfilo/gwn</quote> a dipodia has been lost, such as Nauck supplies by &lt;<quote lang="greek">h)/gagen: e)xqro\s d'&gt; o)ce/a kla/zwn</quote>. For (1) a verb is wanted to govern <quote lang="greek">o(/n</quote>, and (2) the description of the eagle, beginning with <quote lang="greek">o)ce/a kla/zwn</quote>, clearly refers to the Argive host, not to Polyneices only. But if, with Scaliger, we read <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">o(\s ...*polunei/kous</lemma>, no such loss need be assumed. The correspondence between anapaestic systems is not always strict, and the monometer <quote lang="greek">o)ce/a kla/zwn</quote> could stand here, though the anti-system has a dimeter in the same place (129). The MS. reading <quote lang="greek">o(\n...*polunei/khs</quote> probably arose from a misunderstanding of the scholium:&mdash;<quote lang="greek">o(/ntina strato\n *)argei/wn, e)c a)mfilo/gwn neike/wn a)rqei/s, h)/gagen o( *polunei/khs, oi(=on a)mfilogi/a| xrhsa/menos pro\s to\n a)delfo/n: dia\ braxe/wn de\ ei)=pen au)to/, w(s gnwri/mou ou)/shs th=s u(poqe/sews</quote>.

By <quote lang="greek">dia\ braxe/wn de\ ei(=pen au)to/</quote>, the Schol. meant not merely the indefiniteness of <quote lang="greek">neike/wn e)c a)mfilo/gwn</quote>, but also the compactness of <quote lang="greek">*polunei/kous &verbar; a)rqei\s e)k neike/wn</quote> for <quote lang="greek">o(/ntina strato\n h)/gagen o( *polunei/khs</quote>. But a transcriber, noticing that the Schol. joined <quote lang="greek">a)rqei/s</quote> with <quote lang="greek">*polunei/khs</quote>, might easily infer that <quote lang="greek">o(\n...*polunei/khs</quote> ought to stand in the text, and might take <quote lang="greek">dia\ braxe/wn</quote> as meaning that the verb <quote lang="greek">h)/gage</quote> could be understood.&mdash;L has the Doric <quote lang="greek">ga=|</quote>, and presently <quote lang="greek">ga=n, u(pere/pta</quote>, which I keep: see Appendix.</p>

The words do not mean that the Argive army was posted on hills around Thebes: the only hills available were to the N. of the town. The <quote lang="greek">*)ismh/nios lo/fos</quote> (<bibl n="Paus. 9.10.2">Paus. 9.10.2</bibl>), on which Donaldson places the Argives, was merely a low eminence close to one of the <emph>city</emph> gates. Thebes stood on a low spur <emph>of</emph> ground projecting southward, and overlooking the plain. Sophocles has elsewhere described the Argive besiegers, with topographical correctness, as having &lsquo;set their leaguer <emph>round the plain of Thebes</emph>&rsquo; (<cit><bibl n="Soph.

Poetry often represented a struggle between an eagle and a dragon or snake (<quote lang="greek">dra/kwn</quote> could mean either, the &lsquo;dragon&rsquo; being conceived as a sort of huge python); as <bibl n="Hom.

<p>(2) The <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">dus</lemma> in <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">dusxei/rwma</lemma> must refer to difficulty experienced by the vanquished Argives, not by the victorious Thebans. The word must mean, then, &lsquo;<emph>a thing hard to overcome</emph>,&rsquo; not, &lsquo;<emph>a victory won with difficulty.</emph>&rsquo; So <quote lang="greek">dusxei/rwtos</quote> is &lsquo;hard to subdue&rsquo; (<bibl n="Hdt. 7.9">Her. 7.9</bibl>), as <quote lang="greek">a)xei/rwtos</quote> is &lsquo;unsubdued&rsquo; (<bibl n="Thuc. 6.10">Thuc. 6.10</bibl>), and <quote lang="greek">eu)xei/rwtos</quote> &lsquo;easy to subdue&rsquo; (<bibl n="Xen.

<p> First <quote lang="greek">e)peiso/dion</quote>. Creon, the new king, enters from the central door of the palace. Recognising the loyalty which the elders had shown to his predecessors, he expresses his own conception of the duty which a king owes to the State. He then announces the edict which, in accordance with that conception, he has published concerning the two brothers. The Chorus submissively acknowledge his right to do so, but express no approval. A guard now arrives (223), and announces that the king's edict has already been violated by an unknown hand, which has strewn dust upon the corpse of Polyneices. Creon dismisses him with threats of a dreadful death for him and for his fellows, if they fail to discover and produce the offender.

<p> There is a general dramatic analogy between this speech and that of Oedipus in <bibl n="Soph. OT 216"><title>O. T.</title> 216</bibl>&mdash;275. In each case a Theban king addresses Theban elders, announcing a stern decree, adopted in reliance on his own wisdom, and promulgated with haughty consciousness of power; the elders receive the decree with a submissive deference under which we can perceive traces of misgiving; and as the drama proceeds, the elders become spectators of calamities occasioned by the decree, while its author turns to them for comfort.

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">stei/xousan a)stoi=s</lemma>.

If Demosthenes had said <quote lang="greek">stei/xousan a)stoi=s</quote>, this must have seemed to refer to the fellow-citizens of Aeschines, &mdash;the Athenians. The orator therefore modified the poet's phrase by substituting <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">o(mou=</lemma>,&mdash;a word vague enough to suggest the concern of other Greek states besides Phocis in the peril.</p>

But, since <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ta/xous</lemma> is free from objection, such a change is unwarrantable.

<p>The Chorus had not thought it possible that any one should brave death to bury the corpse (220). But the deed has been done, and without leaving a trace (252).

<p>Man is master of sea and land; he subdues all other creatures; he has equipped his life with all resources, except a remedy against death. His skill brings him to prosperity, when he observes divine and human laws, but to ruin when he breaks them.&mdash;At that moment Antigone is led in, and the coryphaeus speaks the closing anapaests (376&mdash;383).

<p> Kvi&ccaron;ala and Wecklein reject these four verses, despairing of the difficulties found in vv. 466, 467, which have been variously amended; see Appendix. The alleged difficulties are, (1) <quote lang="greek">par' ou)de\n a)/lgos</quote>: (2) the mention of the mother only: (3) the position of <quote lang="greek">qano/nt'</quote>, which might suggest the sense, &lsquo;slain by my mother&rsquo;: (4) <quote lang="greek">hi)sxo/mhn</quote> (as L has it). Before dealing with these points, I would call attention to a trait which the impugners of these verses have overlooked, and which speaks strongly for the genuineness of the passage as a whole, corrupt though it be in certain words. That trait is the clause <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">toi=sde d' ou)k a)lgu/nomai</lemma> in 468, returning upon the thought <quote lang="greek">par' ou)de\n a)/lgos</quote> in 466. This series of three clauses, in which the second is opposed to the first, and the third re-iterates the sense of the first, is peculiarly Sophoclean: cp. <cit><bibl n="Soph.

The first question is, Could an Attic poet have used <quote lang="greek">h)nsxo/mhn</quote> for <quote lang="greek">h)nesxo/mhn</quote>? We can only say that we find nothing really like it, and that no support for it can be drawn from the Homeric forms in which <quote lang="greek">a)na/</quote> suffers apocope, viz., <quote lang="greek">a)/nsxeo = a)nasxou=</quote> (<bibl n="Hom.

Still, there is force in Prof. Tyrrell's remark (<title>Classical Review</title>, vol. 11. p. 140) that &lsquo;<quote lang="greek">h)nsxo/mhn</quote> is just the form in which an Attic poet would have applied apocope of <quote lang="greek">a)na/</quote>, inasmuch as he would have felt that he was only sacrificing the redundant augment.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In my first edition I placed in the text the emendation of Semitelos (1887) <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">h)/|sxunan ku/nes</lemma>. Cp. <cit><bibl n="Hom.

If the <quote lang="greek">es</quote> of <quote lang="greek">ku/nes</quote> had been obliterated, <quote lang="greek">ne/kun</quote> would easily have arisen (esp. after <quote lang="greek">n</quote>); and a change of <quote lang="greek">u</quote> into <quote lang="greek">o</quote> would have taken <quote lang="greek">h)/|sxunan</quote> far towards <quote lang="greek">hi)sxo/mhn</quote>. But, while I still hold that this brilliant conjecture has no small degree of probability, I also recognise the justice of the criticism that the context here decidedly favours a verb in the first person.</p>
<p>Other emendations will be found in the Appendix. Most of them assume that we must have <quote lang="greek">h)nesxo/mhn</quote> (or <quote lang="greek">a)nesxo/mhn</quote>), and therefore alter the words <quote lang="greek">qano/nt' a)/qapton</quote> and <quote lang="greek">ne/kun</quote> in various ways, &mdash;usu. omitting <quote lang="greek">ne/kun</quote>. The verses produced by these processes are wretched, while, from a palaeographical point of view, they are pure conjectures, which do not attempt to account for the tradition in L.&mdash;Two points remain.

<p> It is not of much moment that L, like the later MSS., gives this verse to Ismene. Errors as to the persons occur not seldom in L (see, e.g., cr. n. to <bibl n="Soph. OC 837"><title>O.

To me it seems certain that the verse is Antigone's, and that one of the finest touches in the play is effaced by giving it to Ismene. The taunt, <quote lang="greek">kaka\s gunai=kas ui(e/si</quote>, moves Antigone to break the silence which she has kept since v. 560: in all this scene she has not spoken to Creon, nor does she now address him: she is thinking of Haemon,&mdash;of the dishonour to <emph>him</emph> implied in the charge of having made such a choice, &mdash;<quote lang="greek">w(s ai)ei\ to\n o(moi=on a)/gei qeo\s w(s to\n o(moi=on</quote>.

<p>The sentence of death just passed on Antigone leads the Chorus to reflect on the destiny of her house, and on the power of fate generally.&mdash;When a divine curse has once fallen upon a family, thenceforth there is no release for it. Wave after wave of trouble vexes it. Generation after generation suffers. These sisters were the last hope of the race; and now an infatuated act has doomed them also. &mdash;What mortal can restrain the power of Zeus? Human self-will and ambition may seem to defy him, but he is drawing them on to their ruin.&mdash;Anapaests (626&mdash; 630) then announce the approach of Haemon.

If <quote lang="greek">e)te/tato</quote>, then the sentence is complete at <quote lang="greek">do/mois</quote>.

This difficulty would be avoided by changing <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">u(pe/r</lemma> to <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">o(/per</lemma>: but then <quote lang="greek">r(i/zas fa/os</quote> must mean, &lsquo;the comfort (or hope) afforded by the <quote lang="greek">r(i/za</quote>,&rsquo;&mdash;a strange phrase. And <quote lang="greek">te/tato</quote> confirms <quote lang="greek">u(pe/r</quote> as well as <quote lang="greek">fa/os</quote>. I therefore prefer <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">o(\ te/tato</lemma>. (2) The next point concerns <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">nin</lemma>. Reading <quote lang="greek">o(\ te/tato</quote>, Wecklein still refers <quote lang="greek">nin</quote> to <quote lang="greek">r(i/zas</quote>, not to <quote lang="greek">fa/os</quote>, saying that the constr. is as though <quote lang="greek">a(=s u(pe\r e)sxa/tas r(i/zas</quote> had preceded. This is a grammatical impossibility. With <quote lang="greek">o(\ te/tato, <emph>nin</emph></quote> can refer only to <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">fa/os</lemma>. Can this be justified? Thus, I think. The <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">e)sxa/th r(i/za</lemma> of the family is the last remaining means of propagating it. A light of hope (<lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">fa/os</lemma>) was &lsquo;spread above&rsquo; this &lsquo;last root,&rsquo;&mdash;as sunshine above a plant,&mdash;because it was hoped that the sisters would continue the race. The sisters themselves are, properly speaking, the <quote lang="greek">e)sxa/th r(i/za</quote>. But as the word <quote lang="greek">r(i/za</quote> can also have an abstract sense, denoting the chance of propagation, the sisters can here be identified with the <emph>hope</emph>, or <quote lang="greek">fa/os</quote>, which shines above the <quote lang="greek">r(i/za</quote>. In Greek this is the easier since <quote lang="greek">fa/os</quote> was often said of <emph>persons</emph>, as <cit><bibl n="Hom. Il. 18.102"><title>Il.</title> 18.102</bibl> <quote lang="greek">ou)de/ ti *patro/klw| geno/mhn fa/os</quote></cit>, <cit><bibl n="Eur. Hec. 841">Eur. <title>Hec.</title> 841</bibl> <quote lang="greek">w)= de/spot', w)= me/giston *(/ellhsin fa/os</quote></cit>. To say <quote lang="greek">katama=n fa/os</quote> (<quote lang="greek">do/mwn</quote>) is like saying, &lsquo;to mow down the hope of the race,&rsquo;&mdash;in this case, the two young lives. A further reason against referring <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">nin</lemma> to <quote lang="greek">r(i/za</quote> is that the verb should then be, not <quote lang="greek">katama=|</quote>, but <quote lang="greek">e)cama=|</quote>, as <cit><bibl n="Soph.

The proposed change of <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">fa/os</lemma> into <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">qa/los</lemma>, though not difficult in a palaeographical sense, is condemned by <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">te/tato</lemma>, which does not suit <quote lang="greek">qa/los</quote>, but exactly suits <quote lang="greek">fa/os</quote>.

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">kat' au)= &hellip; a)ma=|,</lemma> = <foreign lang="greek">katama=| au)=</foreign>, &lsquo;mows down in its turn&rsquo; (not, &lsquo;otherwise than we hoped&rsquo;). In my first edition I adopted the conjecture <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">kopi/s</lemma>. Prof. Tyrrell's able defence of the MS. <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ko/nis</lemma> (<title>Classical Review</title>, vol. 11. p. 139), though it has not removed all my difficulties, has led me to feel that more can be said for that reading than I had recognised. I now prefer, therefore, to leave <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ko/nis</lemma> in the text, and to re-state here the arguments for and against it.
</p>
<p>(1) If <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ko/nis</lemma> be right, <quote lang="greek">ko/nis qew=n tw=n nerte/rwn</quote> is the dust, belonging (due) to the gods infernal, which Antigone strewed on her brother's corpse; it is <quote lang="greek">foini/a</quote>, because the corpse was gory. The strongest point in favour of <quote lang="greek">ko/nis</quote> is that it is in harmony with the following words, <quote lang="greek">lo/gou t' a)/noia kai\ frenw=n e)rinu/s</quote>. The whole sense then is: &lsquo;She, too&mdash;the last hope of the race&mdash;is now to die,&mdash;for a handful of blood-stained dust (i.e., for a slight, yet obligatory, act of piety towards her slain brother)&mdash;and for those rash words to Creon,&mdash;the expression of her frenzied resolve.&rsquo; On the other hand, the objection to <quote lang="greek">ko/nis</quote> is the verb <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">katama=|</lemma>, which implies the metaphor of reaping. (See Appendix.) The proposed version, &lsquo;covers,&rsquo; is impossible, and, if possible, would be unsuitable. What we want is a verb meaning simply &lsquo;destroys,&rsquo; or &lsquo;dooms to death.&rsquo; Now it is true that Greek lyric poetry often tolerates some confusion of metaphor (see on v. 117, and cp. <bibl n="Soph. OT"><title>O. T.</title></bibl> p. lviii): the question is whether this example of it be tolerable. Prof. Tyrrell holds that it is excused by the tumult of feeling in the mind of the Chorus. That is, the metaphor of a young life &lsquo;mowed down&rsquo; is not completed by a mention of the <emph>agent</emph>, the Destroyer: it is swiftly succeeded in the speaker's thought by a dramatic image of the <emph>cause</emph>, Antigone sprinkling the dust, and defying Creon. This is conceivable; but it is at least extremely bold.</p>
<p>(2) If we read <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">kopi/s</lemma>, then <quote lang="greek">katama=|</quote> is appropriate, and <quote lang="greek">foini/a</quote> also has a more evident fitness. The great objection is the want of unison with <quote lang="greek">lo/gou t' a)/noia kai\ frenw=n e)rinu/s</quote>. If the <quote lang="greek">t'</quote> after <quote lang="greek">lo/gou</quote> means &lsquo;both,&rsquo; the <quote lang="greek">kopi\s nerte/rwn</quote> is the deadly agency as seen in the girl's rash speech and resolve: if the <quote lang="greek">t'</quote> means &lsquo;and,&rsquo; it is an agency to which these things are superadded. On either view the language is awkward. This must be set against the gain in unity of metaphor.</p>
<p>It has further been urged against <quote lang="greek">kopi/s</quote> that the word is too homely. This may be so; but we lack proof. <quote lang="greek">kopi/s</quote> seems to have been a large curved knife, known to the Greeks chiefly as (<emph>a</emph>) a butcher's or cook's implement, (<emph>b</emph>) an oriental military weapon. It does not follow, however, that the effect here would be like that of &lsquo;chopper,&rsquo; or of &lsquo;scimitar,&rsquo; in English. The dignity of a word may be protected by its simplicity; and <quote lang="greek">kopi/s</quote> is merely &lsquo;that which cuts.&rsquo; Pindar was not afraid of homeliness when he described a chorus-master as a <quote lang="greek">krath/r</quote>, or an inspiring thought as an <quote lang="greek">a)ko/na</quote> (cp. <bibl n="Soph. OC 1052"><title>O. C.</title> 1052</bibl> n.). Nicander could say, of the scorpion, <quote lang="greek">toi/h oi( ke/ntroio kopi/s</quote> (<bibl n="Nic. Ther. 780"><title>Ther.</title> 780</bibl>). If <quote lang="greek">kopi/s</quote> be right, the change to <quote lang="greek">ko/nis</quote> may have been caused, not by a misreading of letters, but by mere inadvertence,&mdash;the copyist having the word <quote lang="greek">ko/nis</quote> in his thoughts at the moment: it has already occurred frequently (<bibl n="Soph. Ant. 247">247</bibl>, <bibl n="Soph. Ant. 256">256</bibl>, <bibl n="Soph. Ant. 409">409</bibl>, <bibl n="Soph. Ant. 429">429</bibl>).&mdash;See Appendix.

<div3 id="cl606" type="commLine" n="606">
<p> The MS. <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">pantogh/rws</lemma> is unquestionably corrupt. Sleep, the renewer of vigour, could not be described as &lsquo;bringing old age to all.&rsquo; Nor can the epithet be explained as &lsquo;enfeebling all,&rsquo; in the sense of &lsquo;subduing them&rsquo;; nor, again, as &lsquo;attending on all, even to old age.&rsquo; The neighbourhood of <quote lang="greek">a)gh/rws</quote> is not in favour of <quote lang="greek">pantogh/rws</quote>, but against it; in the case of <quote lang="greek">pantopo/ros&mdash;a)/poros</quote> (360), and of <quote lang="greek">u(yi/polis&mdash;a)/polis</quote> (370), there is a direct contrast between the two words. Either <quote lang="greek">pa/nt' a)grw=n</quote> or <quote lang="greek">pantagreu\s</quote> (see cr. n.) would be good, if <quote lang="greek">ou)/t'</quote> could be taken from the next verse, and added to this. But <quote lang="greek">ou)/t'</quote> clearly belongs, I think, to the next verse,&mdash;as will be seen presently. Bamberger proposed <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">pantoqh/ras</lemma>, or <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">panto/qhros</lemma>. The former would be a subst. like <quote lang="greek">i)xquoqh/ras</quote>, &lsquo;fisherman,&rsquo; <quote lang="greek">o)rniqoqh/ras</quote>, &lsquo;fowler&rsquo;: the latter (which I should prefer), an adj. like <quote lang="greek">polu/qhros</quote>, &lsquo;catching much&rsquo; (Heliodorus 5. 18), <quote lang="greek">eu)/qhros</quote>, &lsquo;having good sport.&rsquo; <quote lang="greek">panto/qhros</quote> would suit the sense well. But its probability depends on the way in which we conceive the corrupt <quote lang="greek">pantogh/rws</quote> to have arisen. It is evident that the genuine <quote lang="greek">a)gh/rws</quote> in the next line had something to do with it. It seems most likely that the eye of the transcriber who first wrote <quote lang="greek">pantogh/rws</quote> had wandered to <quote lang="greek">a)gh/rws</quote>, and that by a mere inadvertence he gave a like ending to the earlier word. Now this might most easily have happened if the sixth letter of the earlier series had been <quote lang="greek">*g</quote>, but would obviously have been less likely if that letter had been <quote lang="greek">*q</quote>. I therefore think it more probable that <quote lang="greek">pantogh/rws</quote> arose from <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">pa/nt' a)greu/wn</lemma> than from <quote lang="greek">panto/qhros</quote>. It is immaterial that the last four letters of the latter are nearer to the MS., since, on the view just stated, the transcriber's error arose from the fact that the consecutive letters <quote lang="greek">a)g</quote> were common to <quote lang="greek">a)greu/wn</quote> and <quote lang="greek">a)gh/rws</quote>, and that, from these letters onwards, he accidentally copied <quote lang="greek">a)gh/rws</quote>. It may be added that such an error would have been easier with a separate word like <quote lang="greek">a)greu/wn</quote> than with the second part of a compound like <quote lang="greek">panto/qhros</quote>.&mdash;The verb <quote lang="greek">a)greu/w</quote>, &lsquo;to catch&rsquo; (common both in verse and in prose) is used by  Soph. in fr. 507.&mdash; Soph. was thinking of <bibl n="Hom.

How, then, could the poet say that <title>Zeus</title> is not subdued by &lsquo;the months <emph>of the gods</emph>&rsquo;<emph>?</emph> The simple answer is that the term <quote lang="greek">qew=n</quote> is not opposed to Zeus, but includes him.

<p> Seidler transposes vv. 663&mdash;667, placing them after 671. The object is to bring vv. 668&mdash;671 into immediate connection with 662. In this there is one slight grammatical gain; since, as the vv. stand in the MSS., <quote lang="greek">tou=ton ...to\n a)/ndra</quote> (668) means, &lsquo;the man who acts thus&rsquo; (viz., as described in vv. 666 f.). But the order given in the MSS. is right. The transposition obliterates one of the finest touches in the speech. Creon demands that the obedience of the citizens to the ruler shall be absolute (666 f.). And then he supplements this demand with a remark on the dignity of such obedience. The man who so obeys gives the best proof that he could also rule (668 ff.). Seidler destroys the point of vv. 668 ff. by placing them after 662.</p>
<p>The connection of thought in the whole passage&mdash;which is slightly obscured by compression&mdash;may be most clearly shown by taking the verses in small consecutive groups. (1) 659 f. If I tolerate disloyalty</p>
<p>in my own relatives, I shall encourage it in other citizens. (2) 661 f. <title>For</title> (<quote lang="greek">ga/r</quote>) only a man who is firm (<quote lang="greek">xrhsto/s</quote>) where his own relatives are concerned will be found to uphold justice in the State (i.e. will have the authority necessary for doing so). (3) 663 f. Now, I recognise disloyalty in any one who breaks the law and defies the government, as Antigone has done. (4) 666 f. Instead of so doing, the citizen is bound to obey the government in everything. (5) 668&mdash;671. There is nothing slavish in that; on the contrary, it shows that the citizen is not only a good subject, but would, if required, be a good ruler;&mdash;as he would also be a good soldier.&mdash;Then comes the general censure on unruliness (672&mdash;676). And then the conclusion:&mdash;I must vindicate my authority, and punish Antigone (677 &mdash;680).

<head>750-757</head>
<p> Objections have been made to the traditional order of these verses, chiefly in two respects. (1) 755 <quote lang="greek">ei) mh\ path\r h)=sq'</quote> is&mdash;it is argued&mdash;the strongest thing said by Haemon, and ought therefore to come immediately before Creon's final outburst, <quote lang="greek">a)/lhqes</quote>; (758). How could it be followed by merely so mild a phrase as <quote lang="greek">mh\ kw/tille/ me</quote>?&mdash;We may reply:&mdash; Haemon says that, <emph>if</emph> Creon were not his father, he <emph>would have</emph> thought him mad. It is to this that <quote lang="greek">mh\ kw/tille/ me</quote> refers, meaning, &lsquo;Do not seek to deceive me by an affectation of filial deference.&rsquo; (2) 757 <quote lang="greek">bou/lei le/gein ti</quote> is too mild a remark&mdash;it is said&mdash;to form the climax of provocation to Creon's anger. We may reply:&mdash;It is in substance, if not in form, such a climax, &mdash;for a father who holds that <emph>unquestioning</emph> obedience (640) is a son's first duty. It asserts Haemon's right to maintain his own views against his father's,&mdash;<quote lang="greek">dia\ di/khs i)e/nai</quote>, as Creon put it (742). The traditional order seems, therefore, to be right.</p>
<p>Three modes of transposition have been proposed. (1) Enger puts 756 and 757 after 749. Then <quote lang="greek">kw/tille</quote> (756) refers to Haemon's plea that he has his father's cause, and that of religion, at heart. We lose nothing by such a transposition; but neither do we gain.</p>
<p>(2) Donner (in his transl., ed. 1863) simply transposed verses 755 and 757, leaving the rest as they stand. For this it may fairly be said that 757 comes very fitly after 754. On the other hand it seems to me that 756 does not aptly follow 757.</p>
<p>(3) Pallis arranges thus:&mdash;749, 756, 755, 754, 757, 750&mdash;753. Thus <quote lang="greek">kena\s gnw/mas</quote> (753) becomes the last sting.&mdash; The fact is that, in a stormy altercation, we do not look for a closely logical texture and a delicately graduated <foreign lang="it">crescendo.</foreign> The MS. order is (to my mind) the best; but other arrangements are possible, and would be nearly as good.
</p>
<p> Creon, instead of replying to v. 749, abruptly repeats his resolve. <quote lang="greek">ou)k e)/stin w(s tau/thn e)/ti zw=san gamei=s</quote> (fut.) <quote lang="greek">pote/</quote>, it cannot be that you shall ever wed her while she yet lives; i.e. she is to die at once, and can become your bride, if ever, only <quote lang="greek">e)n *(/aidou</quote> (654). <bibl n="Soph.

In one of these tombs&mdash; chosen for the remoteness of its situation (773)&mdash;Antigone is to be immured.

<p>Creon's edict had announced that the transgressor would be publicly stoned to death (36). It is to this that the anxious question of the Chorus alludes (772). Creon had already said that Antigone's doom was to be <quote lang="greek">ka/kistos</quote> (489). But now, at least, he feels that he cannot inflict such a death on the maiden, his kinswoman. She shall die, not by stoning, but by starvation. The choice is not prompted by cruelty, but simply by the desire to avoid physical violence.</p>
<p>The danger of a <quote lang="greek">mi/asma</quote>&mdash;to be avoided by a dole of food&mdash;has no relation to the special circumstances,&mdash;Antigone's royal birth, and the nature of her offence. In the ancient belief, that danger existed whenever a person was put to death by starvation. Two notions were probably blended; (<emph>a</emph>) that, if a little food was given, the death was nature's work, not man's; (<emph>b</emph>) that the <quote lang="greek">ne/rteroi</quote> claimed an indemnity for the usual <quote lang="greek">e)nagi/smata</quote>.

So, too, when a Vestal was to be buried alive, the small vault in the Campus Sceleratus was furnished with a couch, a burning lamp, and a small table, on which the dole was placed,&mdash;bread, olives, milk, and a jug of water (  <bibl n="Plut.

<p> Third stasimon. Strophe 781&mdash;790=antistr. 791&mdash;800.</p>
<p>After Creon's and Haemon's speeches, the comment of the Chorus was in a neutral tone (724). When Haemon departed in anger, they spoke words implying that allowance must be made for the heat of youth (767). This beautiful ode is in a kindred strain. If Haemon has sinned against great <quote lang="greek">qesmoi/</quote>&mdash;loyalty to country and to father&mdash;at least he is under the influence of a god whom none can withstand.</p>
<p>The pathos of the maiden's fate is heightened by this plea for her lover. When she is led in by the guards, on her way to death, the Chorus avow that pity works with them even as love with Haemon (801&mdash;805). A perfect preparation is thus made for the lyric dialogue between the Chorus and Antigone (806&mdash;882).

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">pa/redros e)n a)rxai=s</lemma>. I leave these words in the text, without marking them as corrupt, because the case against them is not decisive, while no emendation is certain. But I strongly suspect them. If sound, they mean that the love inspired by the maiden's eyes is a power &lsquo;enthroned in sway by the side of the great laws.&rsquo; The great laws are those &lsquo;unwritten&rsquo; moral laws which most men feel and acknowledge (cp. on 454 f.); here, especially, the law of loyalty to country, the law of obedience to parents. In Haemon's case, love has shown that it is at least of equal force with these <quote lang="greek">qesmoi/</quote>. For <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">pa/redros</lemma>, cp. <cit><bibl n="Soph.

<p>The words answer metrically to <quote lang="greek">fu/cimos ou)dei/s</quote> (788). The first two syllables of <quote lang="greek">pa/redros</quote> therefore represent a resolved long syllable. Pindar affords some instances of such resolution (see Appendix), and there is a probable example below (970 <quote lang="greek">a)gxi/polis *)/arhs</quote>, where see n.). But it is rare, and certainly unpleasing. As</p>
<p>a whole, too, the phrase <quote lang="greek">pa/redros e)n a)rxai=s</quote> is suspicious. A yet stronger objection is the strangeness of describing the power which is <emph>in conflict with</emph> the <quote lang="greek">qesmoi/</quote> as their assessor, or peer, in sway; an expression which would seem appropriate only if that power was working in harmony with them; as when  Eur. ( <bibl n="Eur. Med. 843">Eur. <title>Med.</title> 843</bibl>) speaks of <quote lang="greek">sofi/a| pare/drous...e)/rwtas, &verbar; pantoi/as a)reta=s cunergou/s</quote>,&mdash;&lsquo;the loves that sit with wisdom, co-workers of all excellence,&rsquo;&mdash;those aspirations of the soul which assist intellectual effort.</p>
<p>The best line of emendation yet suggested is that of Semitelos, who writes <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">w(/ste pe/ra dra=n</lemma>. He supposes that <quote lang="greek">pe/ra dra=n</quote> became, first, <quote lang="greek">pa/redron</quote> (<quote lang="greek">*p*e*r*a*d*r*a*n&mdash; *p*a*r*e*d*r*o*n</quote>). Then, <quote lang="greek">pa/redron qesmw=n</quote> seeming obscure, a marginal gloss <quote lang="greek">e)n a)rxai=s</quote> was added. This gloss came into the text, dislodging <quote lang="greek">w(/ste</quote>: and <quote lang="greek">pa/redron</quote> became <quote lang="greek">pa/redros</quote>, to agree with <quote lang="greek">i(/meros</quote>. The original sense, then, was: &lsquo;the <quote lang="greek">i(/meros</quote> prevails, so that one transgresses the great <quote lang="greek">qesmoi/</quote>.&rsquo; Cp. <cit><bibl n="Soph.

Though <quote lang="greek">o)fru/s</quote> and <quote lang="greek">deira/s</quote> could be said of a mountain,  Soph. is here thinking simply of the human form. <quote lang="greek">pagklau/tous</quote> (L) might be proleptic (cp. n. on <quote lang="greek">a)di/kous</quote>, <bibl n="Soph.

<p>The Niobe of Sipylus has usually been identified with a colossal rock-image on the N. side of the range. It is rudely carved in relief, within a rectangular niche on the face of a limestone cliff, and represents a woman seated on a throne. (See Stark, <title>Niobe</title>, pl. 1, Leips. 1863: cp. Baumeister, <title>Denkm.</title> p. 1029). Prof. W. M. Ramsay, however, holds that this image is the &lsquo;very ancient&rsquo; <quote lang="greek">a)/galma</quote> of Cybele mentioned by <bibl n="Paus. 3.22.4">Paus. 3.22.4</bibl>. In two respects it differs from the ancient accounts of the Niobe (quoted below): (<emph>a</emph>) it does not &lsquo;weep,&rsquo;&mdash;for the rainwater drops from the front of the niche, clear of the figure; and (<emph>b</emph>) the likeness to a human form grows, instead of vanishing, as one approaches. (<title>Journ. Hellen. Studies</title> III. 61 ff., 1882.) This has been confirmed by another traveller, Herr Schweisthal (as reported in the <title>Berl. Phil. Wochenschr.</title>, May 28, 1887, p. 704). He finds the true Niobe at no great distance from the Cybele, but nearer Magnesia, and in the vicinity of a stream (the Jarikkaia) which Humann, in his &lsquo;Excursion into Sipylus&rsquo; (1881), had already identified with the Achelous of <bibl n="Hom. Il. 24.616"><title>Il.</title> 24.616</bibl>. It is a natural phenomenon,&mdash;the semblance&mdash;as seen from a distance&mdash;of a draped woman, seated high on the rocks; she looks towards the right, and lifts her right arm, as if in lament.</p>
<p>The best ancient description is by a poet whose native place was in that neighbourhood,&mdash;Quintus Smyrnaeus (1. 293&mdash; 306):&mdash;&lsquo;Her streaming tears still fall from the heights of the rugged cliff; and in sympathy with her the sounding waters of the Hermus make lament, and the lofty peaks of Sipylus, over which the mist that shepherds dread floats evermore. A great marvel is she to passers by, because she is like a sorrowful woman, who mourns some cruel grief, and weeps without stint. Such verily seems the figure, when thou gazest at it from afar; but when thou drawest near, lo, 'tis but a sheer rock, a cliff of Sipylus&rsquo; (<quote lang="greek">fai/netai ai)ph/essa pe/trh, *sipu/loio/ t' a)porrw/c</quote>).</p>
<p>Nonnus was thinking of the effect <emph>from the road</emph>, when he wrote (2. 160), <quote lang="greek">e(/ssomai w(s *nio/bh kai\ e)gw\ li/qos, o)/fra kai\ au)th\n &verbar; lai+ne/hn stena/xousan e)poiktei/rwsin o(di=tai</quote>. Pausanias, too, says that, at a certain distance from the cliff, <quote lang="greek">dedakrume/nhn do/ceis o(ra=n kai\ kathfh= gunai=ka</quote>, but that the illusion vanishes on a nearer approach (1. 21 &sect; 3).

The moments of life through which Antigone is now passing are like the moments through which Niobe passed as she felt the beginning of the change into stone.&mdash;Why does Antigone rejoin, <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">oi)/moi gelw=mai</lemma>? Because her thought had been, &lsquo;my doom is terrible and miserable as Niobe's&rsquo;; but the Chorus had answered, &lsquo;It is indeed glorious for thee to be as Niobe.&rsquo; She had looked for present pity.

    <p> Few problems of Greek Tragedy have been more discussed than the question whether these vv., or some of them, are spurious.  Arist. ( <bibl n="Aristot. Rh. 3.16">Arist. <title>Rhet.</title> 3. 16</bibl>&sect; 9) quotes <bibl n="Hom. Od. 24.912">vv. 911, 912</bibl>, and certainly had the whole passage in his text of  The Soph. interpolation, then, if such it be, must have been made soon after the poet's death; and has been imputed to his son  Iophon (<quote lang="greek">o( yuxro/s</quote>), or some other sorry poet; or to the actors. I confess that, after long thought, I cannot bring myself to believe that  Soph. wrote 905&mdash;912: with which 904 and 913&mdash;920 are in organic unity, and must now stand or fall. Some remarks will be found in the Appendix.</p>
<p>The main points (to my mind) are briefly these. (1) The general validity of the divine law, as asserted in 450&mdash; 460, cannot be intelligibly reconciled with the limitation in vv. 905&mdash;907. (2) A still further limitation is involved in 911 f. She has buried her brother, not simply as such, but because, while he lived, he was an irreplaceable relative. Could she have hoped for the birth of another brother, she would not, then, have felt the duty to be so binding. (3) The composition of vv. 909&mdash;912 is unworthy of Sophocles.

<p>As Antigone spoke the verses ending at 943, the guards were in the act of leading her forth. The choral ode may have begun before she had vanished; but she is not to be conceived as still present when she is apostrophised (949, 987).</p>
<p>A princess is about to be immured in a rocky cell. The Chorus remember three other royal persons who have suffered a like fate&mdash;Dana&euml;, Lycurgus and Cleopatra. The only points which these cases have in common with Antigone's are the facts of noble birth and cruel imprisonment.</p>
<p>All four cases illustrate the same general truth&mdash;no mortal can resist fate. Dana&euml; and Cleopatra were innocent; Lycurgus was guilty. But the Chorus do not mean to suggest Antigone's guilt or innocence; still less, to foreshadow the punishment of Creon.

<p> Cleopatra is the third example. Her father was the wind-god, Boreas: her mother, the Athenian Oreithyia, whom he carried off to his wild home in Thrace. Cleopatra married Phineus, king of the Thracian Salmydessus, on the W. coast of the Euxine, not far from the entrance to the Bosporus. She bore him two sons. He afterwards put her away, and imprisoned her. Her imprisonment is not directly mentioned here: but cp.  <bibl n="Diod. 4. 44">Diod.  4. 44</bibl>, who says of Heracles, when serving with the Argonauts, <quote lang="greek">th\n *kleopa/tran e)k th=s fulakh=s proagagei=n</quote>. Phineus then married Eidothea, sister of Cadmus. Eidothea put out the eyes of Cleopatra's two sons, and caused them also to be imprisoned.</p>
<p>It is the fate of Cleopatra herself which  Soph. means to compare with Antigone's: this is plain from 986. The fate of the sons is made so prominent only because nothing else could give us so strong a sense of the savage hatred which pursued the mother.</p>
<p> Soph. supposes the outline of the story to be familiar. Cleopatra has already been divorced and imprisoned. The poet chooses the moment at which Cleopatra's sons are being blinded by Eidothea, with the sharp shuttle in her blood-stained hands. Ares, the god of cruel bloodshed, beholds with joy a deed so worthy of his Thracian realm.</p>
<p>The name of Cleopatra (like that of Capaneus, 133) is not mentioned. Two strophes are given to this theme, partly, perh., as having an Attic interest (982).  Soph. wrote two plays called <quote lang="greek">*fineu/s</quote>. We know only that Cleopatra's sons were there called <quote lang="greek">*)/oarqos</quote> (?<quote lang="greek">*parqe/nios</quote> H. Weil) and <quote lang="greek">*kra/mbos</quote>: and that the subsequent blindness of Phineus was represented as a punishment of his cruelty (schol. Apoll. Rhod. 2. 178). Eidothea was mentioned by  Soph. in his <quote lang="greek">*tumpanistai/</quote> (schol. on 980),&mdash;a play which perh. concerned the Dionysiac worship, since the <quote lang="greek">tu/mpanon</quote> (kettle-drum) was used in his <quote lang="greek">o)/rgia</quote> as well as in those of Cybel&egrave;. Another version called her Idaea, daughter of Dardanus.</p>

<p>L's accent, <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">pela/gewn</lemma>, points to the truth,&mdash;as similar small hints in that MS. have been found to do elsewhere also (cp. <bibl n="Soph.

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">qeou\s miai/nein</lemma>. Teiresias had said that the altars were defiled (1016). Creon replies that he will not yield, even if birds fly with the carrion up to the very throne of Zeus;&mdash;&lsquo;<emph>for no mortal can pollute the gods.</emph>&rsquo; Campbell takes this to be an utterance of scepticism, like <quote lang="greek">ou)k e)/fa tis &verbar; qeou\s brotw=n a)ciou=sqai me/lein</quote> (<bibl n="Aesch. Ag. 369">Aesch. <title>Ag.</title> 369</bibl>),&mdash;anticipating the Epicurean conception of gods who are neither pleased nor angered by men.</p>
<p>This view seems to do some injustice to the poet's dramatic psychology. I read the words quite differently. The most orthodox Greek piety held that &lsquo;no mortal could pollute the gods.&rsquo; See, for example,  <title>H. F.</title> 1232. Heracles, having recovered sanity after slaying his children, has covered his face, to hide it from the holy light of the sun. Theseus &mdash;who is a type of normal <quote lang="greek">eu)se/beia</quote>&mdash; makes him uncover, saying,&mdash;<quote lang="greek">ti/ d'; ou) miai/neis qnhto\s w)\n ta\ tw=n qew=n</quote>. The sungod cannot be polluted by a mortal. The idea of religious <quote lang="greek">mi/asma</quote> was that a mortal had contracted some impurity which disqualified him for communion with the gods. The tainting of an altar cut off such communion by bringing uncleanness to the very place where men sought to be cleansed. Creon excitedly imagines a seemingly worse profanation, and then excuses his apparent impiety by a general maxim which all would admit:&mdash;&lsquo;no man can pollute the gods.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The sky-throne of Zeus is still more sacred than his altar on earth: if defilement cannot reach him there, much less here.&rsquo; The sophism is of the kind with which an honest but stubborn and wrongheaded man might seek to quiet his conscience. Creon reveres Zeus (304): he feels for the majesty of the gods, and refuses to believe that they can honour the wicked (284 ff.). But his religious sense is temporarily confused by his anger.

<p> The <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">po/leis</lemma> are the cities which had furnished contingents to the Argive expedition against Thebes. These cities are stirred with passionate hatred against Creon by the tidings that burial has been refused to their fallen warriors. There is no <emph>direct</emph> allusion to the war of the Epigoni,&mdash;the expedition which the sons of the fallen chiefs led against Thebes, and in which they destroyed it. Bergk's <quote lang="greek">suntara/contai</quote> might suggest such an allusion; but the pres. <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">suntara/ssontai</lemma> is right. The reference is to the feelings which <emph>now</emph> agitate the cities. Those feelings are one day to produce the new war. Here the prophet notes them only as signs of a still distant storm. Having foretold a domestic sorrow for the father, he now foreshadows a public danger for the king.</p>
<p>It has been objected that the play contains no hint of burial having been denied to any one except Polyneices. This is not exactly the case: the phrase <quote lang="greek">tw=n e)xqrw=n kaka/</quote> in v. 10 is such a hint. But it was unnecessary for the poet to state a fact which all his hearers would assume. Every one knew how Creon had refused burial to the Argives, and how Theseus had recovered their corpses by force of arms. In the <title>Supplices</title> of  Eur. the Chorus consists of widows and mothers of the unburied warriors. No Athenian exploit was more famous (<bibl n="Hdt. 9.27">Her. 9.27</bibl>; <bibl n="Isoc. 4.52">Isocr. <title>Paneg.</title> &sect; 52</bibl>, <title>Encom. Helen.</title> &sect; 31, <title>Panath.</title> &sect; 168;   <bibl n="Plat. Menex. 244">Plat. <title>Menex.</title> 244</bibl>; <bibl n="Lys. 2.4">[Lys. ] or. 2 &sect;&sect; 4 ff.</bibl>: <bibl n="Dem. 60.7">[Dem. ] or. 60 &sect;&sect; 7 ff.</bibl>). The war of the Epigoni, which was included in the epic <title>Thebais</title> ( <bibl n="Paus. 9. 9">Paus.  9. 9</bibl>&sect; 5), was dramatised both by  Aesch. and by  Soph. (<quote lang="greek">*)epi/gonoi</quote>).</p>
<p>Just as, in the <bibl n="Soph. OC"><title>O. C.</title></bibl> (1410 n.),  Soph. glances at the theme of his <title>Antigone</title>, so here he might naturally glance&mdash;however indirectly&mdash;at a later chapter of the Theban story,&mdash;whether his <title>Epigoni</title> already existed, or was still in the future. Dramatically, the reference is the more fitting, since the legend represented Teiresias as still living, and still zealous for Theban welfare, when the Epigoni came.&mdash;For other views of the passage, see Appendix.

<p> The question between L's <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">labei=n</lemma>, and the <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">*kre/on</lemma> of later MSS., is not an easy one to decide. If <quote lang="greek">labei=n</quote> is an error, then it must be explained by the scribe's eye having wandered to v. 1094. But it has not been noticed (I think) that the argument from v. 1094 is two-edged. There, the scribe of L wrote <quote lang="greek">labei=n</quote>, which was afterwards corrected to <quote lang="greek">lakei=n</quote>, either by his own hand or by another. It might be held, then, that he wrote <quote lang="greek">labei=n</quote>, by an error of the eye, in 1094, because his archetype had <quote lang="greek">labei=n</quote> in 1098. The epexegetic construction of the inf.

In the <quote lang="greek">pa/goi</quote> adjacent to it was the rocky tomb of Antigone (774 n.).&mdash;Hermann assumed the loss of some vv. after 1110, in which Creon described the <quote lang="greek">e)po/yios to/pos</quote>,&mdash;explaining that he would first bury Polyneices, and then free Antigone. But what need was there for this, when he was himself to accompany his servants? Besides, his men, like all the other Thebans, might be supposed to know the place meant; and the Chorus had already said what was to be done there. Equally baseless is Bergk's theory that vv. 1111 &mdash;1114 are an interpolation, designed to fill a gap in the original text. See the notes on them. Dindorf agrees with Bergk only so far as to suspect vv. 1111, 1112.

<div3 id="cl1119" type="commLine" n="1119">
<p> The traditional reading, <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">*)itali/an</lemma>, may be supported by these considerations. (1) Southern Italy, the seat of so many Greek colonies, was preeminently associated with the cultivation of the vine; and Sophocles has himself used the name which expresses that fact: <title>Triptolemus</title> fr. 538 <quote lang="greek">*oi)nwtri/a te pa=sa kai\ *turshniko\s &verbar; ko/lpos *aigustikh/ te gh= se de/cetai</quote>. (2) The opening words of the ode, <quote lang="greek">*kadmei/as nu/mfas a)/galma</quote>, claim Thebes as the birth-place of Dionysus. Though Italy, then, is mentioned before Eleusis, Parnassus and Euboea, that precedence has not the effect of representing Italy as the head-quarters of the Dionysiac worship. Rather the mention of Italy just after Thebes serves to exalt the Theban god by marking the wide range of his power. And this reference to a distant country well suits the immediately following <quote lang="greek">pagkoi/nois</quote>, expressing that Eleusis receives votaries from every part of the Greek world. (3) Athenian colonists founded Thurii, on the site of Sybaris, in 444&mdash;3 B.C.,&mdash;only two or three years before the probable date of this play. Thus, just at this time, the Athenian mind had been turned towards Southern Italy, and the allusion would strike a chord of sympathy in the audience. It may be worth remembering that the poet himself would naturally have felt a more than common interest in the new home of his friend Herodotus.</p>
<p>The only worthy rival of <quote lang="greek">*)itali/an</quote> is the conjecture <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">*)ikari/an</lemma>. This was the name of a deme in the N.  E. of Attica, picturesquely situated in an upland valley bounded on the N. by the mountainchain (&lsquo;Aphorismo&rsquo;) which shuts in the plain of Marathon, and on the s. by Pentelicus. The site&mdash;at a place called &lsquo;Dionyso&rsquo;&mdash;is proved by local inscriptions, found by members of the American School in 1888. The story was that, when Dionysus first entered Attica, he was received at Icaria by Icarius, whom he taught to make wine. Icaria was associated with the earliest celebrations of the rural Dionysia (thus the <quote lang="greek">a)skwliasmo/s</quote>, or dancing on greased wine-skins, was said to have been introduced by Icarius himself), and with the infancy of Attic drama in both kinds,&mdash;as it was also the birth-place of Thespis , and, at a later time, of the comic poet Magnes. Inscriptions and other remains show that, in the 5th century B.C., it was the seat of an active Dionysiac worship, with dramatic performances. These discoveries remind us that Sophocles might well have called Icaria <quote lang="greek">kluta/n</quote>. Prof.  C. Merriam A. further points out that, in literature, the legend of Icaria is often associated with that of Eleusis (<title>American School at Athens: Seventh Annual Report</title>, 1887&mdash;88, p. 96). To Statius,  <bibl n="Stat. Theb. 12.619"> <title>Theb.</title> 12. 619</bibl>(<title>Icarii Celeique domus</title>), may be added  <bibl n="Apollod. 3.14.7">Apollod.  3. 14. 7</bibl>, Lucian <title>De Salt.</title> 39 f., Nonnus 27. 283 ff., etc. But these facts remain: (1) <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">*)itali/an</lemma> is also suitable, and is in all the MSS.: (2) it widens the range ascribed to the god's power: (3) a corruption of <quote lang="greek">*)ikari/an</quote> into <quote lang="greek">*)itali/an</quote> is not one to which the letters would readily lend themselves, and would have been the less likely to occur because Icaria was familiarly associated with Dionysus.

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">pneio/ntwn</lemma>, Brunck's simple correction of <quote lang="greek">pneo/ntwn</quote>, heals the metre. The MS. reading in 1137 f. is above all reasonable suspicion; and these verses now agree with them. It is a sin against all critical method to make violent changes in 1137 f.&mdash;as Dindorf (followed by Wecklein) does&mdash;in order to keep the short syllable of <quote lang="greek">pneo/ntwn</quote> here. Hermann's argument against <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">pneio/ntwn</lemma>, which has deterred editors from admitting it, was strangely weal. He said that the first syllable of the epic <quote lang="greek">pnei/w</quote> never occurs with ictus (i.e., in arsis); and that, if the tragic poets had used that form, they would at least not have put an ictus on the <quote lang="greek">pnei</quote>. But Homer repeatedly has <quote lang="greek">pnoih=|</quote> with ictus on the 1st syll. (as first word of the verse): and as <quote lang="greek">pnoih/</quote> to <quote lang="greek">pnoh/</quote>, so is <quote lang="greek">pnei/w</quote> to <quote lang="greek">pne/w</quote>. It is plain, therefore, that the Homeric absence of ictus from the <quote lang="greek">pnei</quote> of <quote lang="greek">pnei/w</quote> was purely an accident of convenience in composition, &mdash;the phrases being <quote lang="greek">me/nea pnei/ontes, zefuri/h pnei/ousa, h(du\ ma/la pnei/ousan, pnei/ei te kai\ e(/rpei</quote>, etc. We need not dwell, then, on the fact which makes a second fallacy in the argument,&mdash;viz. that the ictus on <quote lang="greek">pnei</quote> here is only equal to that which falls on <quote lang="greek">ont</quote> (see   Anal.). Tragic lyrics teem with epic forms and phrases. <quote lang="greek">za/w</quote> was at least as familiar a word as <quote lang="greek">pne/w</quote>. Yet twice in lyrics  Soph. has ventured to use the epic <quote lang="greek">zw/w</quote>: <cit><bibl n="Soph. El. 157"><title>El.</title> 157</bibl> <quote lang="greek">oi(/a *xruso/qemis zw/ei</quote></cit>: <title>O.C.</title> 1213 <quote lang="greek">zw/ein</quote>. Is it, then, reasonable to suppose that the poet, requiring &macr;&macr;&macr; instead of &breve;&macr;&macr;, would have hesitated to use the familiar epic form <quote lang="greek">pneio/ntwn</quote>? Nor is this all. In <bibl n="Aesch. Lib. 621">Aesch. <title>Cho.</title> 621</bibl> the MSS. give <quote lang="greek">pne/onq' a( kuno/frwn u(/pnw|</quote>: where <quote lang="greek">pne/onq' a( = su/mmetron</quote> in the strophe (610), and the 1st syllable is (pace Hermanni) necessarily long, being that of a spondee (or trochee): Heath's correction, <quote lang="greek">pnei/onq'</quote>, is therefore certain.</p>
<p>Other conjectures are: (1) <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">i)w\ pu/rpnwn a)/strwn xorage\ kai\ nuxi/wn</lemma> (G. Wolff). The objection is that the contracted <quote lang="greek">pu/rpnous</quote> and <quote lang="greek">pu/rpnoun</quote> do not justify <quote lang="greek">pu/rpnwn</quote> for <quote lang="greek">purpno/wn</quote>: cp. <cit><bibl n="Eur.

Here <quote lang="greek">pneo/ntwn</quote> is a spondee. But such a synizesis seems very improbable. Remark, too, that L's <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">xorage\ a)/strwn</lemma> does not warrant us in supposing that <quote lang="greek">a)/strwn</quote></p>
<p>originally preceded <quote lang="greek">xorage/</quote>. Neglect of elision is frequent in L: thus, to take one play only, the <bibl n="Soph. OC"><title>O.

The deletion of <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">kai/</lemma> before <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">nuxi/wn</lemma> is also varranted by instances in which <quote lang="greek">kai/</quote> has been thrust into L. Here, the <quote lang="greek">kai/</quote> would decidedly enfeeble the passage.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">xora/g' a)/strwn</lemma>. The sympathetic joy of the elemental powers&mdash;stars, moon, and sea&mdash;was especially associated with those night-festivals in which Dionysus bore his mystic character, as the young <quote lang="greek">*)/iakxos</quote> of the Eleusinian ritual, the companion of Demeter and Cora (n. on <bibl n="Soph.

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">prodw=sin</lemma>. <foreign lang="greek">prodido/nai h(dona/s</foreign> could not mean merely, &lsquo;to <emph>resign</emph>&rsquo; one's joys. It necessarily implies a fault on the loser's part; and it is precisely because Creon had committed such a fault that I believe <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">prodw=sin</lemma> to be sound. The man accused of taking a bribe to break the law was described at 322 as <quote lang="greek">e)p' a)rgu/rw|... th\n yuxh\n prodou/s</quote>. Our word, &lsquo;to forfeit,&rsquo; i.e. &lsquo;to lose by one's own fault,&rsquo; seems fairly to represent the shade of meaning which distinguishes <quote lang="greek">prodido/nai h(dona/s</quote> from <quote lang="greek">a)pollu/nai h(dona/s</quote>. Creon's joys&mdash;the life of his son, and the good opinion of his subjects&mdash;have been sacrificed by him to the indulgence of stubborn self-will. Athenaeus, who twice quotes this passage (cr. n.), shows that c. 200 A. D. it was read as above: he is our oldest and best source for it. L's <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">a)ndro\s</lemma> must be considered in connection with the fact that L (like our other MSS.) omits v. 1167. L has a point at <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">prodw=sin</lemma>, and its reading was (I suspect) understood thus: &lsquo;when (men) forfeit their pleasures, I do not count that the part of a man&rsquo; (i.e. of one who can be really said to live).

<p>The kind of tomb which the poet here imagines is perhaps best represented, in Greece, by the rock-tombs of Nauplia, and of Spata in Attica. These consist of chambers worked horizontally into the rock, and approached by a passage or <quote lang="greek">dro/mos</quote>, answering to that which Creon's men have to traverse before they reach the <quote lang="greek">sto/mion</quote> of the tomb. The general type seems to have been determined by that of the more elaborate domed tombs, such as the so-called &lsquo;Treasury of Atreus&rsquo; at Mycenae, which, like these ruder copies, were entered by a <quote lang="greek">dro/mos</quote>. Indeed, the Nauplia tombs indicate a rough attempt to reproduce the dome (<quote lang="greek">qo/los</quote>). [See Helbig, <title>Das Homer. Epos aus den Denkm. erl&auml;utert</title>, p. 53, with the sources quoted there in nn. 5, 6.]</p>
<p>The phrase <quote lang="greek">loi/sqion tu/mbeuma</quote> (1220) might suggest a recess <emph>within</emph> the principal chamber, like that in the &lsquo;Treasury of Atreus&rsquo;; but it is simpler to take it as merely &lsquo;the furthest part of the tomb.&rsquo; We may observe that the words <quote lang="greek">katw=ruc</quote> (774) and <quote lang="greek">kataskafh/s</quote> (891) are sufficiently explained if we suppose that the <quote lang="greek">dro/mos</quote> leading to the chamber sloped downwards from the entrance.

<p> The simple correction, <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">keleusma/twn</lemma> for <quote lang="greek">keleu/smasin</quote>, is (I think) certainly right. Cp. <cit><bibl n="Aesch.

<p>With <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">keleu/smasin</lemma>, we have only two tolerable resources. (1) To join <quote lang="greek">keleu/smasin e)c a)qu/mou despo/tou</quote>, &lsquo;orders given by him.&rsquo; But, though <quote lang="greek">toi=s e)c a)q. desp. keleu/smasin</quote> could be defended by <quote lang="greek">th\n e)c e)mou= dusbouli/an</quote> (95), the phrase without the article is very strange. In phrases which might appear similar, it will be found that a verb has influenced the use of <quote lang="greek">e)k</quote> with gen.: thus <cit><bibl n="Soph. Aj. 137"><title>Ai.</title> 137</bibl> <quote lang="greek">se\ d' o(/tan... &verbar; lo/gos e)k *danaw=n kako/qrous e)pibh=|</quote></cit>: <cit><bibl n="Aesch.

<p>(2) The alternative is to amend <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">e)c a)qu/mou</lemma>. Only one correction is probable, viz. <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">o)cuqu/mou</lemma>. The decisive objection to this is the sense. It could mean only, &lsquo;swift to wrath,&rsquo; like <quote lang="greek">o)cu/xolos</quote> (955). It could not mean merely, &lsquo;agitated&rsquo; (by alarm). But Creon is no longer proud or fierce; he has been humbled: his late words (1211 ff.) expressed only grief and fear.</p>
<p>Dindorf writes <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">keleu/masin</lemma>, holding this to be the older Attic form (cr. n.). The fact appears to be that both <quote lang="greek">ke/leuma</quote> and <quote lang="greek">ke/leusma</quote> are well attested in our MSS. of some authors: and there is no evidence from inscriptions. As regards the verb, Lobeck (on <bibl n="Soph. Aj. 704"><title>Ai.</title> 704</bibl>) remarks that, while <quote lang="greek">e)keleu/sqhn</quote> is far commoner than <quote lang="greek">e)keleu/qhn, keke/leumai</quote> and <quote lang="greek">keke/leusmai</quote> are both well attested for the best age. But Veitch's statement on this point is more accurate. While <quote lang="greek">e)keleu/qhn</quote> is extremely rare in classical Greek, <quote lang="greek">keke/leumai</quote> is nearly (if not quite) unknown to it. It would be very rash, then, to affirm that  Soph. must have used the nonsigmatic form of the noun.

Nothing could do more violence to the language, or more injury to the dramatic effect, than the Scholiast's theory that <quote lang="greek">ptu/sas prosw/pw|</quote> has a merely figurative sense, &lsquo;with an expression of loathing on his face.&rsquo; When the figurative sense of a word (like <quote lang="greek">ptu/sas</quote>) is to be marked by a qualifying addition (like <quote lang="greek">prosw/pw|</quote>), that addition must not be such as equally to suggest the literal sense. Thus a socialist riot might be called &lsquo;a fire not of Hephaestus&rsquo; (<bibl n="Eur. Orest. 621">Eur. <title>Or.</title> 621</bibl>); but it would not be equally happy to describe it as &lsquo;a fire kindled by the tables of the rich.&rsquo; <quote lang="greek">ptu/sas prosw/pw|</quote>, instead of <quote lang="greek">e)piptu/sas prosw/pw|</quote> (<quote lang="greek">patro/s</quote>), is merely an instance of the boldness with which poetry could use a simple dative to express the object to (or against) which an action is directed.

<p>Haemon, in his madness, meant to kill his father. He had harboured no such purpose before (<ref target="cl752" targOrder="U">see on 752</ref>); and his frantic impulse is instantly followed by violent remorse.  Arist. ( <bibl n="Aristot.

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ti/ d' e)/stin</lemma>. In order to form a judgment on this difficult verse, a careful scrutiny of Sophoclean usage is required.

It has been objected that, at such a time, Creon could not use those words except with reference to Haemon (as in 1266, 1340). From a modern literary point of view, the objection is just. But we should remember how very familiar <quote lang="greek">w)= pai=</quote> actually was as a mode of address, whether by elders to juniors, or by masters to slaves. Here it is used, not as to a slave, but merely as to a younger man; there is in it a certain pathetic appeal for sympathy. (Cp. <quote lang="greek">w)= pai=, w)= te/knon</quote>, as said by the Messenger to Oed. in <bibl n="Soph. OT 1008"><title>O. T.</title> 1008</bibl>, 1030.)

<p><quote lang="greek">au)=</quote> (instead of <quote lang="greek">w)= pai= ti/na</quote>), has not much palaeographical probability. It gives, indeed, a closer correspondence with 1266.

The verb <quote lang="greek">a)mfikei=sqai</quote> prop.=&lsquo;to be set around&rsquo; (as a wall round a city). Perhaps the bold phrase here was partly prompted by the fact that persons embracing each other could be described (<bibl n="Soph. OC 1620"><title>O.

The difficulty is that <quote lang="greek">a)mfikei=sqai</quote> cannot well be said of <emph>one</emph> sorrow (Eurydic&egrave;'s death), and that, therefore, we have to evolve from the epithet <quote lang="greek">ne/on</quote> the notion of a <emph>circle</emph> of woes of which this <quote lang="greek">mo/ros</quote> is one.

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">o(ra=n pa/restin</lemma>. The corpse of Eurydic&egrave;, and probably also the altar at which she fell (1301), are now shown to the spectators by means of the <quote lang="greek">e)kku/klhma</quote>. The precise mechanism of this contrivance is unknown; but the texts leave no doubt as to its general nature. It was a small stage, with space enough for</p>
<p>three or four persons; and was low enough to admit of an actor stepping off it with ease. It was pushed on through the central stage entrance, and was usually brought sufficiently far forward to allow of actors entering or making their exit behind it. Here, the corpse of Eurydic&egrave; is evidently in full view of the house (<bibl n="Soph. Ant. 1299">cp. 1299</bibl>).  Soph. has used the <quote lang="greek">e)kku/klhma</quote> in two other plays: <bibl n="Soph. El. 1458"><title>El.</title> 1458</bibl> (the corpse of Clytaemnestra, with Orestes and Pylades beside it); and in <bibl n="Soph.

<p>Recent explorations in the Dionysiac theatre at Athens have given rise to a theory that there was no permanent raised stage or proscenium before the Roman age. Even if this could be proved, it would still, however, remain certain that some such expedient as the <quote lang="greek">e)kku/klhma</quote> was used in the fifth century. This is proved by the texts of Aesch. , Soph. , and Eur. , as well as by the two scenes of  Ar. where the tragic <quote lang="greek">e)kku/klhma</quote> is parodied ( <bibl n="Aristoph. Ach. 408">Ar. <title>Ach.</title> 408</bibl>&mdash;479; <title>Thesm.</title> 95&mdash;238).  Ar. has the words <quote lang="greek">e)kkuklei=n</quote> and <quote lang="greek">e)skuklei=n</quote>. Wecklein thinks that the <quote lang="greek">e)kku/klhma</quote> was employed when a part of the interior of the house was to be disclosed, but the <quote lang="greek">e)cw/stra</quote> when merely a single object was to be shown; and that the <quote lang="greek">e)cw/stra</quote> was used here (<title>N. Jahrb.</title> 1870, vol. 101, p. 572: <title>Philol.</title> 31. 451). The meaning of <quote lang="greek">e)cw/stra</quote> is, however, doubtful.

But here <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">bwmi/a</lemma> is not merely an adverbial word, to be taken closely with <quote lang="greek">lu/ei</quote>.

Further: even if it were necessary to bind <quote lang="greek">bwmi/a</quote> closely with <quote lang="greek">lu/ei</quote>, it would be bold to say that poetry could not permit this slight modification in the ordinary use of the word, when we remember how free was the adverbial use of adjectives in poetry (e.g., <cit><bibl n="Soph.

(<emph>b</emph>) The MS. <quote lang="greek">h(/de</quote> (or <quote lang="greek">h( de\</quote>) is just the kind of feeble make-shift which is sometimes found in the MSS., where a verse had come down in a mutilated state: see, e.g., on <bibl n="Soph.

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">mo/rwn o( ka/llist' e)/xwn</lemma>. I have adopted <quote lang="greek">e)/xwn</quote>, a conjecture of Pallis for <quote lang="greek">e)mw=n</quote>, on the following grounds. (1) The phrase <quote lang="greek">mo/rwn e)mw=n</quote> could mean nothing but, &lsquo;of all fates possible for me.&rsquo; This, however, is most strange. In 1313 <quote lang="greek">mo/rwn</quote> meant &lsquo;violent deaths&rsquo;: so   <bibl n="Aesch. Seven 420">Aesch. <title>Th.</title> 420</bibl><quote lang="greek">ai(math&verbar;fo/rous mo/rous</quote>. Hence it has been proposed to render <quote lang="greek">mo/rwn e)mw=n</quote> here, (<emph>a</emph>) &lsquo;the deaths caused by me&rsquo;: as Hermann, &lsquo;veniat caedium per me factarum suprema, exoptatissime mihi ultimum diem adducens.&rsquo; (<emph>b</emph>) Figuratively, &lsquo;the many deaths that I have died&rsquo;; <bibl n="Soph. Ant. 1288">cp. 1288</bibl> <quote lang="greek">o)lwlo/t' a)/ndr' e)peceirga/sw</quote>. But neither version is tolerable. (2) Triclinius proposed to make <quote lang="greek">e)mw=n</quote> fem., and to take it with <quote lang="greek">termi/an</quote>: when it would at least be necessary to write <quote lang="greek">e)ma=n</quote> (<foreign lang="la">sc.</foreign> <quote lang="greek">a(mera=n</quote>). But, either with <quote lang="greek">e)mw=n</quote> or with <quote lang="greek">e)ma=n</quote>, the relation of <quote lang="greek">o( ka/llist' ...a)/gwn</quote> to the gen. <quote lang="greek">mo/rwn</quote> is exceedingly awkward. &lsquo;That one among fates which <emph>best</emph> brings my last day,&rsquo; cannot be explained as an equivalent for, &lsquo;that best of fates which brings it&rsquo;; i.e., for <quote lang="greek">mo/rwn o( ka/llistos, o(...a)/gwn</quote>.</p>
<p>Both these difficulties (which to me seem insuperable) are removed by reading <quote lang="greek">mo/rwn o( ka/llist' <emph>e)/xwn</emph></quote>, the best of fates. That <quote lang="greek">e)/xwn</quote> could have been changed to <quote lang="greek">e)mw=n</quote>, either by conjecture or by accident, is shown by v. 575, where at the end of the verse L has the probably true <quote lang="greek">e)moi/</quote>, while other MSS. have <quote lang="greek">e)/fu</quote>. (If <quote lang="greek">ku/nes</quote> is right in 467, and <quote lang="greek">ci/fei</quote> in 1301, these, too, are instances of final words corrupted.) A question of punctuation remains. The comma might follow either <quote lang="greek">e)/xwn</quote> or <quote lang="greek">e)moi/</quote>. I prefer the latter. Cp. <cit><bibl n="Soph.

The epigram was written after Tiberius had been adopted by Augustus in 4 A.D., as he is called <quote lang="greek">*zh=na to\n e)sso/menon</quote>, and perhaps after he had come to the throne (14 A.D.).

Nor does it seem in harmony with the pervading spirit of the poet's work. Rather Creon is exhorted to recognise, with pious resignation, the fixity of the divine decrees.

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">kate/kanon</lemma> is the best, as it is the simplest, emendation of <quote lang="greek">kate/ktanon</quote> (see cr. n.). Though the pres. <quote lang="greek">katakai/nw</quote> is not classical, the aor. is frequent;  Xen. uses it ( <bibl n="Xen. Anab. 3. 1. 2">Xen. <title>An.</title> 3. 1. 2</bibl>, etc.).
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">se/ t' au)= ta/nd'</lemma> is a certain correction of <quote lang="greek">se/ t' au)ta/n</quote>. Here the latter would be like saying, &lsquo;and actually <emph>thee</emph>,&rsquo;&mdash;as if the slaying of Haemon had been comparatively venial. It cannot be naturally explained as meaning, &lsquo;the mother with the son.&rsquo;
</p></div3>
<div3 id="cl1342" type="commLine" n="1342">
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">pro\s po/teron &hellip; pa/nta ga/r</lemma>. The reading of this verse cannot be certainly determined. The traditional text (see cr. n.) exceeds the metre. My own view is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The MS. <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">o(/pa|</lemma> should be struck out. It evidently came in from the margin, having been a gloss on <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">pa=|</lemma>, meant to show that <quote lang="greek">pa=| kliqw=</quote> is not a direct question, but depends on <quote lang="greek">ou)d' e)/xw</quote>. Retaining <quote lang="greek">o(/pa|</quote>, we should have to suppose a double question: &lsquo;nor do I know in what direction, (or) to which thing, I am to look.&rsquo; This is not only very awkward, but very weak. The hiatus after <quote lang="greek">e)/xw</quote>, though not unexampled, is at least another point against <quote lang="greek">o(/pa|</quote>.</p>
<p>(2) L has <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">pa/nta ga/r</lemma> in a line by itself: but, considering the caprices of lyric division in that MS. (as in the rest), we cannot urge that fact as a hint of interpolation. If <quote lang="greek">o(/pa|</quote> was a spurious addition to 1342, then <quote lang="greek">pa/nta ga/r</quote> might easily have been carried over. Again, the words <quote lang="greek">pa/nta ga/r</quote> are not indispensable; yet the effect of <quote lang="greek">le/xria ta)n xeroi=n</quote>, without them, would be rather oddly abrupt. Therefore we are by no means warranted (I think) in ejecting <quote lang="greek">pa/nta ga/r</quote>.</p>
<p>(3) <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">kliqw=</lemma>, for <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">kai\ qw=</lemma>, is certain. On this last point there is now a general agreement.&mdash;The resulting dochmiac differs from that in 1320 only by the &lsquo;irrational&rsquo; long (the <quote lang="greek">w</quote> of <quote lang="greek">i)/dw</quote>) for short (the first of <quote lang="greek">e)/tumon</quote>): and this is admissible. See Metrical Analysis.&mdash;Other views are noticed in the Appendix.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">pro\s po/teron</lemma>, i.e., to the corpse of Haemon at his side, or to that of Eurydic&egrave; in front of him (1297 ff.).</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">i)/dw</lemma>, deliberative subjunct. in the indirect question, depending on <quote lang="greek">ou)k e)/xw</quote>: cp. n. on <bibl n="Soph. OT 72"><title>O. T.</title> 72</bibl>.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">pa=| kliqw=</lemma>, in what direction I am to lean, i.e., where I am to find any support: my son and my wife have fallen: all my fortunes lie in ruin. <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">pa=|</lemma> here answers to the dat. after <quote lang="greek">kli/nomai</quote> when it means &lsquo;to lean against&rsquo; a thing, as <bibl n="Hom. Od. 6.307"><title>Od.</title> 6.307</bibl> (she sits) <quote lang="greek">ki/oni keklime/nh</quote>.&mdash;Not merely, &lsquo;whither I am to betake myself,&rsquo; <quote lang="greek">poi= tra/pwmai</quote>; This is shown by <quote lang="greek">le/xria</quote>.

<div3 id="cl1344" type="commLine" n="1344">
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">le/xria ta)n xeroi=n</lemma>. <quote lang="greek">ta)n</quote> seems right (see cr. n.): the MS. <quote lang="greek">ta/d' e)n</quote> would come from <foreign lang="greek">*T*A*E*N</foreign>. Creon is still touching the corpse of Haemon. The phrase <quote lang="greek">ta\ e)n xeroi=n</quote> would mean, figuratively, &lsquo;the matters with which I am engaged&rsquo; (so <cit><quote lang="greek">e)/xein ti e)n xersi/,</quote> <bibl n="Hdt. 1.35">Her. 1.35</bibl></cit>). Here, the words take a dramatic force from their literal sense. &lsquo;All is amiss with that which I handle.&rsquo; Creon has, indeed, mismanaged the work which his hands found to do; and the proof of it is the corpse which he is touching. <quote lang="greek">le/xrios</quote> =&lsquo;slanting,&rsquo; &lsquo;oblique.&rsquo; As <quote lang="greek">o)rqo/s</quote> means either &lsquo;straight&rsquo; or &lsquo;upright,&rsquo; so <quote lang="greek">le/xrios</quote> can mean either &lsquo;moving sideways&rsquo; (<bibl n="Soph. OC 195"><title>O.C.</title> 195</bibl>), or, &lsquo;not upright,&rsquo; &lsquo;slanting.&rsquo; Cp. <quote lang="greek">pla/gios</quote>, the ordinary prose equiv. of <quote lang="greek">le/xrios</quote>, which has the second sense in Philemon <title lang="greek">*)agu/rths</title> 5 <quote lang="greek">sxh/mata &verbar; pla/gi' e)sti\ ta)/lla, tou=to d' o)rqo\n qhri/on</quote>, man alone is <emph>erect</emph>, while other creatures (i.e. quadrupeds) are bent earthward (cp. <cit><bibl n="Sal. Cat. 1">Sallust, <title>Cat.</title> 1</bibl> <quote lang="la">pecora quae natura <emph>prona...</emph> finxit</quote></cit>). So, here, <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">le/xria</lemma> means primarily &lsquo;awry&rsquo;:&mdash;<quote lang="greek">ta\ pra/gmata ou)k o)rqw=s e)/xei</quote>. Cp. <cit><bibl n="Shak. R2 2.4">Shaksp. <title>Rich. II.</title> 2. 4. 24</bibl> <quote lang="en">And crossly to thy good all fortune goes.</quote></cit>  But it is further tinged with the sense of &lsquo;prone,&rsquo; applicable to the corpse. The Scholiast here has usu. been understood as explaining <quote lang="greek">le/xria</quote> by <quote lang="greek">pla/gia kai\ peptwko/ta</quote>. But he meant only <quote lang="greek">pla/gia</quote> to explain <quote lang="greek">le/xria</quote>, while <quote lang="greek">peptwko/ta</quote> referred to <quote lang="greek">po/tmos... ei)sh/lato</quote>: this is clear (I think) from his whole phrase, <quote lang="greek">pla/gia kai\ peptwko/ta, ta\ me\n e)n xersi/, ta\ de\ e)pi\ th=| kefalh=|</quote>.

It is quite possible to read <emph><quote lang="greek">ta/d'</quote></emph>, as =&lsquo;thus&rsquo;; but then <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ta\ e)n xeroi=n</lemma> would denote <emph>all</emph> his woes, and so we should lose the dramatic blending of a literal with a figurative sense.</p>
