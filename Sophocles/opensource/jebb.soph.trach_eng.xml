<p>It has been the fortune of the <title>Trachiniae</title> to provoke <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Divergent views of the <title>Trachiniae.</title> Difficulty of judging it rightly.</note> a singular diversity of judgments. Dissen and Bergk refer the play to a period when the powers of Sophocles were not yet fully matured<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="1" resp="RCJ"><bibl>Dissen, <title>Kleine Schriften</title>, p. 343</bibl>; <bibl>Bergk, <title>De Sophoclis Arte</title>, p. 26.</bibl></note>.

Schlegel, in his Lectures on Dramatic Literature, goes further still; he pronounces the piece unworthy of its reputed author, and wishes that the responsibility for it could be transferred from Sophocles to some feebler contemporary,&mdash;his son, for instance, the &lsquo;frigid&rsquo; Iophon<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="3" resp="RCJ"><bibl>A. W. Schlegel, <title>Lect.</title> VII.</bibl> All that he says of the <title>Trachiniae</title> is contained in one short paragraph, and the grounds of the condemnation are indicated only in vague terms. &lsquo;There is much both in the structure and plan, and in the style of the piece, calculated to excite suspicion.&rsquo; &lsquo;Many critics have remarked that the introductory soliloquy of Deianeira, which is wholly uncalled-for, is very unlike the general character of Sophocles' prologues.&rsquo; &lsquo;Although this poet's usual rules of art are observed on the whole, yet it is very superficially; nowhere can we discern in it the profound mind of Sophocles.&rsquo; With regard to the prologue&mdash;the only passage which Schlegel specifies&mdash;some remarks will be found below, <ref target="cis22" targOrder="U">&sect; 22.</ref></note>. Yet there has never been a lack of more favourable estimates. In the very year when Schlegel was lecturing at Vienna (1808), Boeckh pointed out the strong family likeness between this and the other six plays<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="4" resp="RCJ"><bibl>A.

L. W. Jacob, <title>Sophocleae quaestiones</title>, vol.

Hermann, Preface to the <title>Trachiniae</title>, p. vi:</bibl> <quote lang="la">&lsquo;Ego quidem, quomodo qui Sophoclem cognitum habeat, an genuina sit haec fabula dubitare possit, non video.

During the last half century, with the growth of a better aesthetic criticism in relation to all things Hellenic, a sense of the great beauties in the <title>Trachiniae</title> has decidedly prevailed over the tendency to exaggerate its defects; indeed, the praise bestowed upon it, in these latter days, has sometimes perhaps been a little too indiscriminate. The play is in fact an exceptionally difficult one to appreciate justly; and the root of the difficulty is in the character of the fable. A necessary prelude to the study of the <title>Trachiniae</title> is to consider the form in which the Heracles-myth had been developed, and the nature of the materials available for the dramatist.</p>
<p><note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">The Heracles myth.&mdash; Argive legends.</note></p></div2>
<div2 id="cis2" type="section" n="2">
<p>The Argive legends are those which best preserve the primitive Dorian conception of Heracles. They are alloyed, indeed, with later elements, of a political origin. Thus, in order that the Dorian conquerors might have some hereditary title to the land, Heracles was made the son of Alcmena, and, through her, a scion of the Perseidae; Tiryns was his heritage, of which he had been despoiled. Again, the struggles between Argos and Sparta for the headship of Peloponnesus have a reflex in those wars which the Argive Heracles wages in Elis or Messenia. But, when such elements have been set aside, there remains the old-Dorian hero, slayer of monsters, purger of the earth, who triumphs over the terrors of Hades, and brings the apples of immortality from the garden of the Hesperides.</p>
<p>We do not know exactly when the &lsquo;twelve labours&rsquo; of Heracles became a definite legend. The earliest evidence for it is afforded by the temple of Zeus at Olympia, about 450 B.C. The twelve labours were there portrayed on the metopes,&mdash;six on those of the western front, and six on those of the eastern. All the twelve subjects are known from the existing remains<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="2" resp="RCJ">The subjects of the western metopes, in order from left to right, were: (1) Nemean lion: (2) Lernaean hydra: (3) Stymphalian birds: (4) Cretan bull: (5) Ceryneian hind: (6) Hippolyt&egrave;'s girdle. Those of the eastern metopes were: (1) Erymanthian boar: (2) Mares of Diomedes: (3) Geryon: (4) Atlas and the Hesperides: (5) Augean stables: (6) Cerberus.&mdash;Treu, <title>Ausgrabungen zu Olympia</title>, iv. c. 4: W. Copland Perry, <title>Greek and Roman Sculpture</title>, ch. xxi. pp. 225 ff.</note>. The list agrees, in much the larger part, with twelve labours  enumerated by the Chorus in the <title>Hercules Furens</title> of Euripides<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="1" resp="RCJ"><bibl n="Eur. Her. 359">Eur. <title>H. F.</title> 359&mdash;429</bibl>. The exploits there enumerated are:&mdash;(1) Nemean lion: (2) Centaurs: (3) Ceryneian hind: (4) Mares of Diomedes: (5) Cycnus: (6) Hesperides: (7) Sea-monsters: (8) Relieving Atlas as supporter of the heavens: (9) Hippolyt&egrave;'s girdle: (10) Lernaean hydra: (11) Geryon: (12) Cerberus. No. 2 in this list,&mdash;the fight with the Centaurs at Pholo&egrave;,&mdash;was merely an episode in the <quote lang="greek">a)=qlos</quote> of the Erymanthian boar, the first subject of the eastern metopes at Olympia. Hence the list of Euripides has really nine <quote lang="greek">a)=qloi</quote> in common with the temple. The three <quote lang="greek">a)=qloi</quote> peculiar to the temple are, Stymphalian birds, Cretan bull, and Augean stables; instead of which Euripides has, Cycnus, Sea-monsters, Relief of Atlas. An express mention of the number <emph>twelve</emph>, as the fixed limit to the series of <quote lang="greek">a)=qloi</quote>, occurs first in Theocr. 24. 81, <quote lang="greek">dw/deka/ oi( tele/santi peprwme/non e)n *dio\s oi)kh=n</quote> &verbar; <quote lang="greek">mo/xqous</quote>.</note>, a play of which the date may be placed about 421&mdash;416 B.C. Neither list knows any places, outside of Peloponnesus, except Crete and Thrace; nor does either list recognise any of those later myths in which Heracles symbolises the struggles of Argos with Sparta. In both lists the journey to the Hesperides has lost its original meaning,&mdash;the attainment of immortality,&mdash;since it precedes the capture of Cerberus. These are some reasons for thinking that a cycle of twelve labours had become fixed in Dorian legend long before the fifth century B.C.<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="2" resp="RCJ">Preller (<title>Gr. Myth.</title> II. 186) adopts the view that the number of twelve labours had probably been first fixed by Peisander, in his epic <quote lang="greek">*(hra/kleia</quote>, <emph>circ.</emph> 650 B.C. (cp. below, &sect; 4). Wilamowitz,  <title>Heracles</title>, vol. I. p. 308, regards the cycle of twelve labours rather as the invention of some Dorian poet of Argolis,&mdash;perhaps of Mycenae,&mdash;who lived not later than the 8th century B.C., and of whose work no trace remains.</note> The Dorians of Argclis were those among whom it first took shape, as the scenes of the labours show. But nothing is known as to the form in which it first became current.</p>
<p>One thing, however, is plain. Although the twelve tasks are more or less independent of each other, the series has the unity of a single idea. Heracles is the destroyer of pests on land and sea, the saviour of Argolis first and then the champion of humanity, the strong man who secures peace to the husbandman and an open path to the sailor: with his club and his bow, he goes forth against armed warriors, or monsters of superhuman  malignity, reliant on his inborn might, and conscious of a divine strain in his blood. This is no Achilles, no image of that chivalry which Aeolian legend had delineated and Ionian poetry adorned; no steeds, swift as the wind, bear his chariot into battle; no panoply of bronze, wrought by Hephaestus, flashes on him, &lsquo;like the gleam of blazing fire, or of the sun as it arises&rsquo;: in the gentle graces of human existence, in the softer human sympathies, he has no portion; no music of the lyre soothes his rest in the camp; he has never known such tears as came into the eyes of the young Achaean warrior, when the aged king of Troy, kneeling at his feet, kissed the hand that had slain Hector; nor has he anything of that peculiar pathos which is given alike to Hector and to Achilles by the dim presage of an early doom, the uncertain shadow which now and again flits across the meridian of their glory; the golden scales, lifted in the hand of Zeus, have never trembled with the fate of Heracles, for his destiny was fixed before his birth, and is inseparable from his origin,&mdash;that he must toil while he lives, and must live until his task has been accomplished. He embodies a sterner ideal; one in which there is less of spiritual charm and of flexible intelligence, but which has a moral grandeur of its own; we might say that relatively to the Ionian view of life it is as the Hebraic ideal to the Hellenic. And this ideal may rightly be called &lsquo;Dorian,&rsquo; in the sense that it presumably represents a conception of the primitive Dorian folk, bearing a general stamp which can be traced in historical expressions of the Dorian nature.</p>
<p>That conception appears in only two other sets of legends besides the Argive. And these belong to near kinsmen of the Dorian stock, the Boeotians and the Thessalians.</p>
<p><note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Boeotian legends.</note>The Boeotian legends concern the birth, childhood, and youth of Heracles. Argive tradition claimed his manhood; and this claim could not be ignored. Nor was it disputed that he sprang from the Argive Perseidae. The Boeotians sought only to reconcile his Argive lineage with a belief that he was born at Thebes. Alcmena, his mother, is the daughter of Electryon, king of Mycenae: she is betrothed to her firstcousin Amphitryon, son of Alcaeus, king of Tiryns. Amphi tryon accidentally kills his uncle, Electryon, and flies, with Alcmena, to Thebes. She requires him, as the condition of their union, to avenge her on the Taphii in western Greece, who have slain her brothers. He sets forth from Thebes to do so. Just before his triumphant return, Zeus visits Alcmena in his likeness, and becomes the father of Heracles. Amphitryon was originally a Theban hero; but the Thebans made him an Argive in order that they might make Heracles a Theban. The name &lsquo;Heracles&rsquo; is itself a proof that Argive legend was predominant enough to extort such a compromise. Hera was the goddess of the pre-Dorian Argos. The story of her hatred towards the Dorian Heracles expressed the hostility of her worshippers to the Dorian invaders. But, when the Dorians had conquered, their legendary champion came to be called <quote lang="greek">*(hraklh=s</quote>, &lsquo;the glorified of Hera&rsquo;; not in the sense that he had won fame by surmounting her persecutions, or through her final reconciliation to him in Olympus; but in the sense that he was the pride of the city which, though it had changed its earthly masters, was still Hera's&mdash;the now Dorian Argos. The old story of her spite against him lived on in poetry, but it had lost its first meaning. It is recorded that an earlier name of &lsquo;Heracles&rsquo; had been &lsquo;Alcaeus,&rsquo; &lsquo;the man of might&rsquo;; and traces of this lingered in Boeotia<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="1" resp="RCJ">Dion Chrysost. or. 31 (p. 615 Reiske) <quote lang="greek">e)n gou=n *qh/bais *)alkai=os a)na/keitai/ tis, o(\n *(hrakle/a fasi\n ei)=nai, pro/teron ou(/tw kalou/menon</quote>. Preller (II. p. 180) quotes the inscription shown in a Farnesian relief on the tripod which Amphitryon dedicated, in his youthful son's name, to the Ismenian Apollo at Thebes: <quote lang="greek">*)amfitru/wn u(pe\r *)alkai/ou tri/pod' *)apo/llwni</quote>. Sextus Empir. <title>Adv. dogm.</title> 3. 36 gives a like inscription, also connecting it with a Theban <quote lang="greek">a)na/qhma</quote>. Diodorus (4. 10) ascribes the change of the hero's name to the Argives: <quote lang="greek">*)argei=oi...*(hrakle/a proshgo/reusan, o(/ti di) *(/hran e)/sxe kle/os, pro/teron *)alkai=on kalou/menon</quote>. According to the popular tradition, this change of name was prescribed by the Delphic oracle, when the hero went thither for purification, after the slaughter of his children at Thebes. (<bibl n="Apollod. 2.4.12">Apollod. 2. 4. 12</bibl>: <bibl n="Ael. VH 2.31">Aelian <title>V. H.</title> 2. 31.</bibl>) <quote lang="greek">*)alkei/dhs</quote> was probably a gentilician name, rather than a patronymic in the narrower sense, as Wilamowitz remarks (  I. Eur. <title>Her.</title>p. 293), adding that <quote lang="greek">*)alkai=os</quote>, the father of Amphitryon, &lsquo;was not invented to explain <quote lang="greek">*)alkei/dhs</quote>,&rsquo; since in that case the form would have been <quote lang="greek">*)alkeu/s</quote>. But Pindar, at any rate, seems to have been thinking of <quote lang="greek">*)alkai=os</quote>, father of Amphitryon, when he wrote <quote lang="greek">*(hrakle/hs, semno\n qa/los *)alkai:da=n</quote> (<title>O.</title> 6. 68). And on the other hand Suidas, <emph>s. v.</emph> <quote lang="greek">*)alkei/dhs</quote> has <quote lang="greek">*)alke/ws ga\r pai=s *)amfitru/wn</quote>.&mdash;A similar name to <quote lang="greek">*)alkai=os</quote> was <quote lang="greek">*)alka/qoos</quote>, a Megarian hero analogous to Heracles. Cp. also <quote lang="greek">*)alkmh/nh</quote>.</note>.</p>
<p>There, too, as in Argolis, the myth is blended with facts of local warfare; Heracles fights for Thebes against the Minyae of Orchomenus. But the true Dorian Heracles is seen in other parts of the Theban story,&mdash;as when he strangles the snakes in his cradle, and slays the lion of Cithaeron. His last act at Thebes is that which he does in the madness sent on him by Hera,&mdash;the slaughter of the children borne to him by Megara, daughter of Creon. This Theban tradition was another compromise with Argive legend, which claimed his best years for the twelve labours. How, then, was he to be severed from Thebes, the home of his youth? He must be forced to fly from it, as blood-guilty&mdash;the guilt being excused by Hera's visitation. Further, Thebes had to account for the non-existence of Theban nobles claiming a direct descent from him. Therefore he slew his Theban children.</p>
<p><note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Thessalian legends.</note>Lastly, there are the Thessalian legends. These belong especially to Trachis, the chief town of Malis, and to the neighbouring region of Mount Oeta. Here, too, there is an element of disguised history; Heracles is the friend of Dorians; he works for the honour of Apollo, the god of the Thessalo-Delphic amphictyony; he conquers aliens, like Cycnus, or establishes good relations with them, as with the Trachinian king Ce&yuml;x. But the spirit of an older conception animates one part of the Thessalian legend,&mdash;the hero's fiery death on the summit of Oeta, when Zeus receives him into heaven. The journey to the Hesperides was probably an older symbol of immortality attained after toil; but if that fable has the charm of the sunset, the legend of Oeta has the grandeur of the hills.</p>
<p>These three cycles of myth,&mdash;the Argive, the Boeotian, and the Thessalian,&mdash;alone reveal the true old-Dorian Heracles. The traditions found elsewhere are either merely local, expressing the desire of particular Dorian communities to link their own deeds with his name, as at Rhodes and Cos; or they show the influence of non-Dorian poets, who altered the original character of the story by interweaving it with other threads of folk-lore. Thus in the <title>Trachiniae</title> the legend of Oeta is combined with legends of Aetolia. We shall understand this process better if we consider the place of Heracles in that  portion of Greek literature which precedes the rise of Attic drama.

<p>The Homeric poems contain only incidental allusions <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Heracles in the Homeric poems.</note> to Heracles, who is associated with the generation before the Trojan war. We hear that he was born at Thebes, being the son of Zeus and Alcmena. His life-long foe, the goddess Hera, defrauded him of his inheritance, the lordship of Argos, by ensnaring Zeus into a promise that this dominion should be held by Eurystheus<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="1" resp="RCJ"><bibl n="Hom.

He delivered Laomedon, the father of Priam, from the seamonster (<quote lang="greek">kh=tos</quote>) sent by the angry gods; and, when the false king withheld the due reward, he sacked Troy. Returning thence, he was driven by storms to Cos<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="3" resp="RCJ">The <quote lang="greek">kh=tos</quote>,  <bibl n="Hom.

<p>The parts of the Homeric epics in which these allusions occur are of various ages; and the allusions themselves are derived from various regions,&mdash;Argos, the western Peloponnesus, Boeotia, Thessaly, the Dorian colonies in Asia Minor. Several of the passages have a more or less intrusive air; one<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="1" resp="RCJ">I refer to  <bibl n="Hom. Il. 19.95"> <title>Il.</title>19. 95</bibl>&mdash;136, where see Leaf's note. The episode occurs in a speech of Agamemnon, who, contrary to Homeric usage, quotes the very words spoken by the gods.

Speaking generally, we may say that in the  <title>Iliad</title> and the <title>Odyssey</title> the Dorian hero is a foreign person.</p>
<p>But this negative result is not the only one which the Homeric notices suggest. They make us feel how difficult it would have been for epic poetry, working in the Homeric spirit, to treat the story of Heracles as a whole. His acts are too incoherent to derive a properly epic unity from his person,&mdash; such an unity as the <title>Odyssey</title>, for example, derives from the person of Odysseus. The original Dorian legend of Heracles had, indeed, the unity of a moral idea; but that is not enough for an epic.</p>
<p><note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">The <title>Heracleia</title> of Peisander.</note></p></div2>
<div2 id="cis4" type="section" n="4">
<p>Little is known of the efforts made to solve this poetical problem. The Dorian Peisander, of Cameirus in Rhodes, is named as the author of an epic poem on Heracles, a <title>Heracleia</title><note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="2" resp="RCJ">Bernhardy, <title>Gr. Lit.</title> vol. II. pt 1, p. 338, collects the principal notices of Peisander.</note>. He seems to have confined himself to the &lsquo;labours&rsquo; which Heracles performed for Eurystheus; and he was the first poet,  we are told, who gave Heracles the lion's skin and the club<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="1" resp="RCJ">See n. on <title>Philoctetes</title> 727. The club was no doubt an original trait of the old Dorian legend.</note>. Peisander is usually placed about 650 B.C.; but, according to one view, that date is too early<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="2" resp="RCJ">The 20th epigram of Theocritus is an inscription in hendecasyllables for a Rhodian statue of Peisander, who, with respect to the deeds of Heracles, is called <quote lang="greek">pra=tos tw=n e)pa/nwqe mousopoiw=n</quote>. Wilamowitz (  I. Eur. <title>Her.</title>p. 309), acknowledging the genuineness of the epigram, nevertheless suggests that the name of Peisander may have been a mere invention of the Asiatic Dorians in the 3rd cent. B.C., and holds that the <quote lang="greek">*(hra/kleia</quote>. ascribed to him was not older than the 6th cent. B.C. According to Theocritus, Peisander described Heracles <quote lang="greek">to\n leontoma/xan, to\n o)cu/xeira,...xw(/sous e)cepo/nasen ei)=p' a)e/qlous</quote>.</note>. In the Alexandrian age he enjoyed a high repute.</p>
<p>The Ionian Panyasis<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="3" resp="RCJ">The penultimate syllable of this Carian name is probably long; another, perhaps more correct, form of it was <quote lang="greek">*panu/assis</quote>. Little weight can be attached to the fact that Avienus, writing about 370 A.D. , has <title>Pany&abreve;si</title> at the beginning of a hexameter (<bibl n="Arat. 175">Arat. <title>Phaen.</title> 175</bibl>).</note> of Halicarnassus,  <emph>circ.</emph> 480 B.C., also <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">The <title>Heracleia</title> of Panyasis.</note> composed a <title>Heracleia</title>, in no less than fourteen books. He took a wider range than Peisander's, and aimed at a comprehensive digest of all the principal legends concerning Heracles. Merits of style and arrangement made him popular; but he did not reach the Homeric level, or work in the Homeric spirit<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="4" resp="RCJ">See the testimonies in Bernhardy, <title>Gr. Lit.</title> II. pt 1, p. 340.</note>. Possibly his large composition, with its survey of heroic deeds in many lands, may have borne some analogy to the great proseepic of his younger kinsman, Herodotus. That kinship interests us here, since it increases the probability that the epic of Panyasis may have been known to the author of the <title>Trachiniae.</title></p>
<p>But to minds in sympathy with Homeric epos it would be evident that there was another way of dealing with the theme of Heracles; a way different from that of Peisander, and still more different from that of Panyasis. Some one episode might be singled out from the mass of legends, and developed by itself, as an epic on a small scale. Hesiod and the Hesiodic school worked thus; they produced, for instance, the <title>Marriage-feast of Ce&yuml;x</title>, relating how Heracles was entertained by that king of Trachis; the <title>Aegimius</title>, turning on the league of Heracles with that Dorian prince; and the extant <title>Shield of Heracles</title>, concerning his fight with Cycnus.</p>

<div2 id="cis5" type="section" n="5">
<p>Lyric poetry also, from an early time, had been busied with these legends. The Ionian Archilochus (<emph>circ.</emph> 670 B.C.) composed a famous hymn to the victorious Heracles. It was known as the <quote lang="greek">kalli/nikos</quote><note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="4" resp="RCJ">In <cit><bibl n="Pind.

Stesichorus of Himera, a city in which Dorian and Chalcidic elements were blended, gave the  spirit of Homeric epos to his choral hymns (<emph>circ.</emph> 620 B.C.). Into this new mould he cast three exploits of Heracles,&mdash;the triumphs over Geryon, Cycnus, and Cerberus<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="1" resp="RCJ"><bibl>Bergk, <title>Poet.

<p>For readers of the <title>Trachiniae</title> this lyric literature has one <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Deianeira associated with Heracles.</note> point of peculiar interest. It is there that we can first trace the association of Heracles with Deianeira. The Dorian Heracles had no original connection with the old heroic legends of Aetolia. The stamp of those legends, and their relation to others, indicate that they come from a pre-Dorian time, when Calydon and Pleuron, surrounded by fertile lands and blooming vineyards, were the strongholds of a chivalry devoted to war and to the chase; a chivalry from which popular tradition derived the images of Deianeira, of her parents Oeneus and Althaea, and of her brother Meleager. The story that Heracles had married Deianeira expressed the desire of immigrants, who had displaced the old Aetolian order, to claim kinship with the Dorian invaders of Peloponnesus.</p>
<p>Pindar, in a lost poem,&mdash;of what class, is unknown,&mdash;told the story somewhat as follows<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="3" resp="RCJ">Schol. on <title>Iliad</title> 21. 194. The schol. on  <bibl n="Hom. Il. 8.368"> <title>Il.</title>8. 368</bibl> probably has the same passage in view when he quotes Pindar as saying that Cerberus had a hundred heads.</note>. Heracles, having gone down to Hades for Cerberus, there met the departed Meleager, who recommended his sister Deianeira as a wife for the hero. On returning to the upper world, Heracles went at once to Aetolia, where he found that Deianeira was being wooed by the river-god Achelo&uuml;s. He fought with this formidable rival,&mdash;who wore the shape of a bull,&mdash;and broke off one of his horns. In order to  recover it, Achelo&uuml;s gave his conqueror the wondrous &lsquo;cornucopia&rsquo; which he himself had received from Amaltheia, daughter of Oceanus. Heracles presented this, by way of <quote lang="greek">e(/dna</quote> or &lsquo;brideprice,&rsquo; to Oeneus<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="1" resp="RCJ"><bibl n="Strab. 10.458">Strabo 10, p. 458.</bibl>.</note>, and duly received the hand of the king's daughter.</p>
<p>Long before Pindar, Archilochus had related how Heracles overcame the tauriform suitor<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="2" resp="RCJ">Schol. <title>Il.</title> 21. 237.</note>, and won the fair maiden; how, after their marriage, Heracles and Deianeira dwelt with Oeneus at Calydon, until they were obliged to leave the country, because Heracles had accidentally slain the king's cupbearer; and how, at the river Evenus, the Centaur Nessus offered insult to the young wife, and was slain by her husband<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="3" resp="RCJ">Schol. Apoll. Rhod. 1. 1212: Dion Chrys. or. 60.</note>.

His birthplace was the island of Leros, near Miletus; but his home was at Athens, and his work, it can hardly be doubted, was known to Sophocles.</p>

<div2 id="cis6" type="section" n="6">
<p>Such, then, was the position of the Heracles-myth at the time when Attic Tragedy was advancing to maturity. This legend had become the common property of Hellas; and its primitive meaning had been, to a great extent, overlaid by alien additions or embellishments. Particular episodes had been successfully treated in epic poetry of the Homeric or Hesiodic school, and also in lyrics, both Ionian and Dorian. But the whole legend had not been embodied in any poem which took rank with the foremost creations of the Greek genius.</p>
<p><note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Comedy.</note>As a person of drama, Heracles made his first appearance in Comedy. It was the Dorian Epicharmus who, in the first half of the fifth century B.C., thus presented the Dorian hero to Syracusan audiences. One of the pieces concerned Heracles in quest of the Amazon's girdle; another dealt with his visit to the jovial Centaur Pholos<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="5" resp="RCJ"><quote lang="greek">*(hraklh=s o( e)pi\ to\n zwsth=ra</quote>: <quote lang="greek">*(hraklh=s o( para\ *fo/lw|</quote>. Cp. Bernhardy, <title>Gk Lit.</title> II. pt 2, p. 529.</note>. The Dorians of Sicily, though Dorian  to the backbone in most things, had a strain of humour and vivacity which tempered the seriousness of their race; in this instance, it was much as if an Irish dramatist of English descent had applied a similar treatment to St George and the dragon.</p>
<p>That Ionians should feel the grotesque side of Heracles, was natural enough. Aristophanes tells us that this hero had become a stock-character of Attic comedy, and claims credit for having discarded him:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It was he that indignantly swept from the stage the paltry ignoble device &lsquo;Of a Heracles needy and seedy and greedy, a vagabond sturdy and stout, &lsquo;Now baking his bread, now swindling instead, now beaten and battered about<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="1" resp="RCJ"><title>Pax</title> 741 ff., translated by Mr B.

<p>Several comedies on Heracles are known by their titles, or <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Satyrdrama.</note> by fragments. His powers of eating and drinking seem to have furnished a favourite point. He also figured much in satyrdrama,&mdash;a kind of entertainment which welcomed types of inebriety.

<div2 id="cis7" type="section" n="7">
<p>Recollecting such traditions of the theatre, we cannot <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Tragedy.</note> wonder if Tragedy was somewhat shy of Heracles. At the best, the legend was difficult to manage,&mdash;even more difficult for tragic drama than for epic narrative. And the difficulty was greatly  increased, now that the essential difference between this hero and the ordinary persons of tragedy had been brought into relief by frequent burlesques.</p>
<p>Aeschylus, indeed, in the <title>Prometheus Unbound</title>, introduced Heracles, who loosed the bonds of Prometheus; and then Prometheus described the route by which his deliverer must journey from the Caucasus to the Hesperides<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="1" resp="RCJ"> <bibl n="Strab. 4">Strabo 4</bibl>, p. 183.</note>. It was a harder matter to take the legend of Heracles as the basis of a tragedy. There are only two such experiments of which we have any clear or definite knowledge. One is the <title>Mad Heracles</title> of Euripides. The other is the <title>Trachiniae</title> of Sophocles.</p>
<p><note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">The <title>Mad Heracles</title> of Euripides.</note>Euripides has taken his subject from the Boeotian legend. Heracles, visited with madness by Hera, slays his children,&mdash;in whose fate the Attic poet involves Megara, probably because, with his plot, it was not easy to dispose of her in any other way. Now, as we saw, this Theban story was framed to explain why Heracles, in early manhood, forsook Thebes for Argolis. The murder is discordant with the general tenour of the Heracles myth, and the discord is but thinly concealed by the resort to Hera's agency. For Euripides, however, this very discord was an attraction. It allowed him, by a bold change of detail, to put a new complexion on the whole story. That change consisted in placing the terrible deed of Heracles not before, but after, his labours for Eurystheus.</p>
<p>The plot is briefly as follows. Heracles has long been absent from Thebes, toiling for Eurystheus; and it is known that he is now engaged in the supreme ordeal,&mdash;the quest of Cerberus. Meanwhile a certain  Lycus from Euboea becomes master of Thebes, and slays Creon. Megara, her three sons, and the aged Amphitryon, are also doomed by him. They are about to die, when Heracles suddenly returns from the nether world, and kills Lycus. He then holds a sacrifice, to purify the house. While engaged in it, he is stricken with madness. He slays Megara and his children. On recovering his senses, he resolves to commit suicide. But Theseus appears,&mdash;the king of Athens whom Heracles has just delivered from Hades. Theseus combats his resolve, offering him an honourable refuge in  Attica. Heracles at last accepts the offer, and departs with his friend.</p>
<p>This, then, is the goal of the great career; this is the result of the strength given by a divine sire, and spent in benefiting men. The evil goddess of Heracles triumphs utterly; at the very moment when his labours are finished, and when, as the old faith taught, his reward was near, he is plunged into an abyss of misery. He passes from our sight, to hide the remainder of his days in the seclusion of a land not his own. Yet, even in this extremity, he has given a proof of strength; he has had the courage to live. He has taught us that, though the mightiest human efforts may end in outward failure, yet no man, if he be true to himself, need suffer moral defeat. Zeus has been faithless to his human son, and Hera's infra-human malevolence has prevailed; but one consolation for humanity remains.</p>
<p>Such is the new reading of the Heracles myth which Euripides has propounded; with admirable power and subtlety, though scarcely with complete artistic success. His interpretation, though full of a deep suggestiveness, is, in fact, too modern for the fable on which it is embroidered.

As to this view, we can only say that it is quite possible, but that there is absolutely no proof of it. On the other hand, one thing is certain: the <title>Trachiniae</title> exhibits a conception and a treatment fundamentally different from those adopted in the <title>Mad Heracles.</title></p>
<p>Two principal elements enter into the mythic material used  <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">The two mythic elements.</note>by Sophocles. The first is the Aetolian legend of Deianeira, whom Heracles rescues from Achelo&uuml;s, and in whose defence he slays the Centaur Nessus. This part of the subject had been treated by Archilochus and Pindar. The second element is the Thessalian legend which set forth the love of Heracles for Iol&egrave;,&mdash;his murder of Iphitus, leading to his servitude under Omphal&egrave;,&mdash;his capture of Oechalia,&mdash;and his death upon Mount Oeta. Here the epic <title>Capture of Oechalia</title> was presumably the chief source. Pherecydes and Panyasis were also available. Hesiodic poems, such as the <title>Marriage-feast of Ce&yuml;x</title>, may have supplied some touches.   Ionof Chios, too, had written a drama called <title>Eurytidae</title><note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="1" resp="RCJ">Nauck, <title>Trag. Frag.</title> p. 734.</note>, but its scope is unknown. Nor can we say whether Sophocles was the first poet who brought the Aetolian and the Thessalian legend into this connection.</p>
<p>The Argive and Boeotian legends are left in the background of the <title>Trachiniae;</title> they appear only in a few slight allusions. But, if we are to read the play intelligently, the drift of these allusions must be understood. We must endeavour to see how Sophocles imagined those events of his hero's life which precede the moment at which the play begins.</p>
<p><note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Later digests of the Heracles legends.</note>Later mythographers, such as Apollodorus and Diodorus, sought to bring a fixed chronology into the chaos of legends concerning Heracles. They framed a history, which falls into six main chapters, thus:&mdash;(1) The Theban legends of the hero's birth and growth. (2) The Argive legends of the twelve labours. (3) The legends concerning Eurytus, Iol&egrave;, Iphitus, and Omphal&egrave;. (4) Campaigns against Troy, Cos, Peloponnesian foes of Argos, and the Giants. (5) The Aetolian legends: Deianeira, Achelo&uuml;s, Nessus. (6) The legends of South Thessaly: Ce&yuml;x of Trachis, Aegimius, etc.; the capture of Oechalia; and the pyre on Oeta.</p>
<p><note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Freedom of the fifth century poets.</note>But, in the fifth century B.C., poets were as yet untrammelled by any such artificial canon. They could use the largest freedom in combining local legends of Heracles, so long as they were careful to preserve the leading features of the myth. We have seen that Euripides, when in his <title>Mad Heracles</title> he placed the madness <emph>after</emph> the labours, was making an innovation which deranged the whole perspective of Theban and Argive legend;  so much so, that the Alexandrian mythographers, deferential to the Attic dramatists in much, never followed Euripides in that.</p>
<p>Sophocles has made no change of similar importance. Yet <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Sequence of events in the <title>Trachiniae.</title></note> his way of arranging the fable differs in one material respect from that of the later compilers. They, as we have seen, place the marriage of Heracles with Deianeira very late in his career&mdash; after his labours for Eurystheus, and after most of his other deeds also. Sophocles puts the marriage much earlier,&mdash;so early, that Deianeira speaks as if it had preceded most, or all, of the hero's labours. Sophocles could do this, because he felt himself free to ignore the Theban legend of the hero's marriage to Megara. And he certainly was not alone in thus differing from the later mythographers. Pausanias mentions a tradition at Phlius, according to which Heracles had already won his Aetolian bride when he went for the golden apples<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="1" resp="RCJ"> <bibl n="Paus. 2. 13. 8.">Paus.2. 13. 8.</bibl></note>.

<p>The outline of the whole story, as Sophocles conceived <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">The antecedents of the plot.</note> it, can now be traced with clearness sufficient, at least, to explain the hints scattered through the play.</p>
<p>1. Heracles is born at Thebes (v. 116), and comes thence (v. 509), in early manhood, to Pleuron, where he wins Deianeira. We are not told whither he was taking his bride, when they met Nessus (v. 562). Since Megara is ignored, there is nothing to exclude the supposition that he was returning to his home at Thebes.</p>
<p>2. Constrained by Hera's wrath, he performs the labours for Eurystheus (v. 1048). The home of his family is now at Tiryns.</p>
<p>3. He visits Eurytus at Oechalia in Euboea (v. 262); who discountenances his passion for Iol&egrave; (v. 359)<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="3" resp="RCJ">The oblique <quote lang="greek">r(ai/oito</quote> in v. 268 leaves an ambiguity. If the word used by Eurytus to Heracles was <quote lang="greek">e)rrai/ou</quote>, the labours for Eurystheus were over. But if it was <quote lang="greek">r(ai/ei</quote>, they were still in progress. The second supposition gives more force to the passage.</note>.</p>
<p>4. He goes on various campaigns, including that against the Giants (1058 ff.).</p>
<p>5. He slays Iphitus (the son of Eurytus), who was then his guest  at Tiryns. The lapse of some considerable time since his visit to Eurytus is implied by the word <quote lang="greek">au)=qis</quote> (v. 270).</p>
<p>Heracles, with Deianeira, his children, and his mother Alcmena, is now forced to leave Tiryns. They are given a new home at Trachis by its king, Ce&yuml;x (v. 38).</p>
<p>6. As a punishment for the treacherous murder of Iphitus, Zeus dooms Heracles to serve Omphal&egrave;, in Lydia, for a year (v. 274). Heracles goes forth from Trachis, leaving his family there (v. 155). They do not know his destination. During his absence, some of his children return with Alcmena to Tiryns; others are sent to his old home at Thebes (1151 ff.).</p>
<p>7. The year with Omphal&egrave; being over, he sacks Oechalia (v. 259).</p>
<p>We are now prepared to follow the plot of the drama itself.</p>
<p><note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Analysis of the play. I. Prologue: 1&mdash;93.</note></p></div2>
<div2 id="cis10" type="section" n="10">
<p>The scene is laid before the house at Trachis.</p>
<p>Deianeira is alone with a female slave, an old and attached domestic, who has been the nurse of her children. Communing with her own thoughts, rather than directly addressing her attendant, the wife of Heracles recalls the sorrows which have been her portion from youth upwards,&mdash;culminating now in a terrible anxiety concerning her absent lord. It is fifteen months since he left home; but no tidings have come from him. And she feels almost sure that something is amiss, when she thinks of a certain tablet which he left with her...</p>
<p>Here the aged Nurse ventures to interpose. Deianeira has several sons; why should not one of them,&mdash;Hyllus, for example, the eldest,&mdash;go in search of his father?</p>
<p>Just then Hyllus himself is seen approaching, and in haste; for he has news to tell. Heracles is, or soon will be, in Euboea, warring against Oechalia, the city of Eurytus. During the past year he has been in servitude to Omphal&egrave;, a Lydian woman.</p>
<p>Deianeira then tells her son the purport of the tablet to which she had previously alluded. It contains an oracle, which shows that this war in Euboea must decide the fate of Heracles; he will die; or he will thenceforth live in peace.</p>
<p>Hyllus at once resolves to join his father in Euboea, and departs for that purpose.</p>
<p>The Chorus now enters: it consists of fifteen Trachinian  maidens, full of kindly sympathy for the Aetolian princess <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Parodos: 94&mdash;140.</note> whom a strange destiny has brought to dwell among them. Invoking the Sun-god, they implore him to reveal where Heracles now is. Deianeira, they hear, is pining inconsolably. Fate vexes, while it also glorifies, her husband; but he is not suffered to perish. Let her keep a good courage: sorrow comes to all mortals, but joy also, in its turn; and Zeus is not unmindful of his children.</p>
<p>Deianeira sadly replies that the young maidens cannot <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">II. First episode: 141&mdash;496.</note> measure such trouble as hers; may they ever be strangers to it! But they shall know her latest and worst anxiety. When Heracles left home, he told her that, if he did not return at the end of fifteen months, she must account him dead. He even explained how his property was to be divided in that event. But, if he survived the fifteenth month, then he would have a peaceful life. Such was the teaching of an oracle which he had written down at Dodona. And the fulfilment of that oracle is now due ...</p>
<p>A Messenger is seen coming; the wreath on his head betokens glad tidings. Heracles lives, is victorious, and will soon come home. Lichas, the herald, has already arrived; but the excited Trachinians, thronging around him, have retarded his progress towards the house.</p>
<p>With an utterance of thanksgiving to Zeus, Deianeira calls upon the maidens of the Chorus and the maidens of her own household to raise a song of joy.</p>
<p>The Chorus respond with a short ode, in the nature of a <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">205&mdash;224.</note> paean.</p>
<p>Before it ceases, Lichas is in sight; a train of captive Euboean women follows him.</p>
<p>In reply to the eager questions of his mistress, Lichas says that Heracles is now at Cape Cenaeum in Euboea, engaged in dedicating a sanctuary to Zeus. These maidens are captives, taken when Oechalia was destroyed: Heracles chose them out &lsquo;for himself and for the gods.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And then Lichas tells how Heracles has been employed during the past fifteen months; how, for a year, he was the slave of Omphal&egrave;; and how, when freed, he avenged that  disgrace upon its ultimate author, Eurytus. Heracles himself, the herald adds, will soon arrive.</p>
<p>Deianeira rejoices, though a shadow flits across her joy as she looks at the ill-fated captives: may Zeus never so visit <emph>her</emph> children!</p>
<p>Among these captives, there is one who strangely interests her; the girl's mien is at once so sorrowful and so noble. She questions her; but the stranger remains silent. &lsquo;Who is she, Lichas?&rsquo; But the herald does not know,&mdash;indeed, has not cared to ask. Deianeira then directs him to conduct the captives into the house.</p>
<p>She herself is about to follow him, when the Messenger, who had first announced the herald's approach, begs to speak with her alone.</p>
<p>He tells her that Lichas has deceived her. The mysterious maiden is no other than Iol&egrave;, the daughter of Eurytus. A passion for Iol&egrave; was the true motive of Heracles in destroying Oechalia. Eurytus had refused to give him the maiden. Lichas himself had avowed this to the Trachinians.</p>
<p>Lichas now re-enters, to ask for Deianeira's commands, as he is about to rejoin his master in Euboea. Confronted with the Messenger, and pathetically adjured by Deianeira, he confesses the truth. Heracles has an absorbing passion for Iol&egrave;; and, indeed, he gave no command of secrecy. But Lichas had feared to pain his mistress: let her pardon him; and let her bear with Iol&egrave;.</p>
<p>Deianeira requests Lichas to accompany her into the house. He is to take a message from her to Heracles, and a gift.</p>
<p><note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">First stasimon: 497&mdash;530.</note>In the ode which follows, the Chorus celebrates the resistless power of Love,&mdash;the power which now threatens Deianeira's peace, and which, in long-past days, brought Heracles to contend for her with Achelo&uuml;s. The short but vivid picture of that combat has a singular pathos at this moment of the drama.</p>
<p><note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">III. Second episode: 531&mdash;632.</note>Deianeira reappears. She has had time now to feel what it will be to live under the same roof with the young and beautiful girl to whom her husband has transferred his love; but she harbours no angry or cruel thoughts. Her sole wish is to regain the heart of Heracles. And a resource has occurred to her.  Long ago, when Heracles was taking her from Aetolia, they came to the river Evenus, where the ferryman, the Centaur Nessus, carried her across. He insulted her, and Heracles shot him with an arrow. As he lay dying, he told her that, if she wished to possess a love-charm by which she could always control the love of Heracles, she had only to collect some of the blood from his wound. She had done so, and had preserved her treasure, according to the Centaur's direction, in a place secluded from the warmth of sun or fire. She had now applied this lovecharm to the inner surface of a festal robe, which she will send as her gift to Heracles. She brings with her a casket, in which she has placed the robe.</p>
<p>Lichas appears, ready to depart, and receives the casket, sealed with Deianeira's signet. She had vowed, she tells him, to send her lord this robe, whenever she should hear of his safety, in order that he might wear it on the day when he made a thank-offering to the gods. Therefore Heracles must not put it on, or produce it, before that day.</p>
<p>The herald promises fidelity, and departs.</p>
<p>In a joyous strain, the Chorus express their bright hope. <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Second stasimon: 633&mdash;662.</note> The dwellers on the coasts and hills of Malis will soon welcome the long-absent hero; and he will come home full of rekindled love for his true wife.</p>
<p>But Deianeira now returns to them in an altered mood. A <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">IV. Third episode: 663&mdash;820.</note> strange thing has happened. In applying the love-charm to the robe, she had used a tuft of wool, which she had then thrown down in the courtyard of the house. After a short exposure to the sun's heat, this tuft of wool had shrivelled away, leaving only a powder. And she remembers that the arrow which slew Nessus was tinged with a venom deadly to all living things. She fears the worst. But she is resolved that, if any harm befalls Heracles, she will not survive him.</p>
<p>The Trachinian maidens are speaking faint words of comfort, when Hyllus arrives from Euboea.</p>
<p>He denounces his mother as a murderess. He describes how Heracles, wearing her gift, stood forth before the altar; how, as the flames rose from the sacrifice, the robe clung to him, as if glued, and spasms began to rend his frame; how, in the frenzy  of those awful agonies, he slew Lichas; and how, at last, he was laid in a boat, and conveyed to the shore of Malis. He will soon be at the house,&mdash;alive, or dead.</p>
<p>The son ends with terrible imprecations on his mother. She goes into the house without a word.</p>
<p><note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Third stasimon: 821&mdash;862.</note>&lsquo;Behold,&rsquo; cry the Chorus, &lsquo;how the word of Zeus has been fulfilled; for the dead do indeed rest from labour.&rsquo; The malignant guile of Nessus has found an unconscious instrument in Deianeira. And the goddess Aphrodit&egrave; has been the silent handmaid of fate.</p>
<p><note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">V. Fourth episode: 863&mdash;946.</note>A sound of wailing is heard within: the aged Nurse enters. Deianeira has slain herself with a sword; bitterly mourned, now, by her son Hyllus, who has learned, too late, that she was innocent.</p>
<p><note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Fourth stasimon: 947&mdash;970.</note>The Trachinian maidens, afflicted by this new calamity, are also terrified by the thought that they must soon behold the tortured son of Zeus.

<p><note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">VI. Exodos: 971&mdash; 1278.</note>As the mournful procession enters, Hyllus, walking beside the litter, is giving vent to his grief, while an old man, one of the Euboeans, is vainly endeavouring to restrain him, lest his voice should break the sick man's slumber.</p>
<p>Heracles awakes. At first he knows not where he is; then his torments revive, and he beseeches the bystanders to kill him; he craves that mercy from his son; he appeals for it to Zeus and to Hades. And then, in a moment of respite, his thoughts go back on his past life,&mdash;so full of suffering, yet a stranger to such anguish as this; so full of victories, and yet doomed to end in this defeat at the unarmed hand of a false woman.</p>
<p>A pause permits Hyllus to announce his mother's death, and to assert her innocence. In using the supposed love-charm, she was obeying the dead Nessus.</p>
<p>Those words send a flash of terrible light into the mind of Heracle&lt;*&gt;. The oracle at Dodona had foretold the time of his &lsquo;release.&rsquo; A still earlier oracle had foretold the manner of his death; namely, that he was to be slain by the dead. The time and the agency coincide. This, then, was the promised &lsquo;release.&rsquo;  The oracles are fulfilled. He sets himself to prepare for death, &mdash;now seen to be inevitable and imminent.</p>
<p>He commands that he shall be carried to the summit of Mount Oeta, sacred to Zeus, and there burned alive. Hyllus is constrained to promise obedience,&mdash;making, however, the condition that he himself shall not put hand to the pyre<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="1" resp="RCJ">The office of kindling the pyre was performed by Philoctetes; see on  <bibl n="Soph. Phil. 802"> <title>Ph.</title>802</bibl> f.</note>. A second behest is then laid upon him. He shall marry Iol&egrave;. In this also he is forced to yield,&mdash;calling on the gods to witness that he submits to a dying father's inexorable will.</p>
<p>All has now been made ready. Heracles summons the forces of that &lsquo;stubborn soul&rsquo; which must upbear him through the last of his ordeals. In the words which close the play, Hyllus gives utterance to the deepest and bitterest of the feelings inspired by his father's cruel fate. Heracles dies forsaken by Zeus. For here, as in the <title>Iliad</title>, there is no presage of his reception among the gods.</p>
<p>The bearers lift their burden, and set forth for Oeta; while the maidens of the Chorus pass from the house of mourning to their own homes in Trachis.
</p></div2>
<div2 id="cis11" type="section" n="11">
<p>In the first and larger part of the play, Deianeira is the <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">The characters.&mdash; Deianeira.</note> central figure, as Heracles is in the second part. The heroine of the <title>Trachiniae</title> has been recognised by general consent as one of the most delicately beautiful creations in literature; and many who feel this charm will feel also that it can no more be described than the perfume of a flower. Perhaps in the poetry of the ancient world there is only one other woman who affects a modern mind in the same kind of way,&mdash;the maiden Nausicaa. We do not know how Deianeira may have been drawn by Archilochus or Pindar; but at least there are indications that the Deianeira of the old Aetolian legend was a being of a wholly different type from the Sophoclean. After her story had become interwoven with that of Heracles, her name, <quote lang="greek">*dhi+a/neira</quote>, was explained to mean, &lsquo;the destroyer of <emph>a husband.</emph>&rsquo; But, in the pre-Dorian days when Aetolian legend first knew her, and when she had as yet nothing to do with Heracles, &lsquo;Deianeira&rsquo; meant &lsquo;the slayer of <emph>men</emph>&rsquo;; it denoted an Amazonian character,&mdash;just  as the Amazons themselves are called <quote lang="greek">a)ntia/neirai</quote>. A true bred princess of Aetolia, the land of warriors and hunters, this daughter of Oeneus &lsquo;drove chariots, and gave heed to the things of war<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="1" resp="RCJ">As Apollodorus says of her, 1. 8 &sect; 1: <quote lang="greek">au)th\ de\ h(nio/xei kai\ ta\ kata\ po/lemon g)/skei</quote>.</note>&rsquo;; her pursuits were like those which employed &lsquo;the armed and iron maidenhood&rsquo; of Atalanta.</p>
<p>How great a contrast to the Deianeira whom Sophocles has made immortal! She, indeed, is a perfect type of gentle womanhood; her whole life has been in her home; a winning influence is felt by all who approach her; even Lichas, whose undivided zeal is for his master, shrinks from giving her pain. But there is no want of spirit or stamina in her nature. Indeed, a high and noble courage is the very spring of her gentleness; her generosity, her tender sympathy with inexperience and misfortune, are closely allied to that proud and delicate reserve which forbids her&mdash;after she has learned the truth about Iol&egrave;&mdash;to send any messages for her husband save those which assure him that her duties have been faithfully fulfilled, and that all is well with his household. From youth upwards she has endured constant anxieties, relieved only by gleams of happiness,&mdash;the rare and brief visits of Heracles to his home. She is devoted to him: but this appears less in any direct expression than in the habitual bent of her thoughts, and in a few words, devoid of conscious emphasis, which fall from her as if by accident. Thus the precepts of Nessus had dwelt in her memory, she says, &lsquo;as if graven on bronze.&rsquo; And why? Because they concerned a possible safeguard of her chief treasure. Staying at home, amidst her lonely cares, she has heard of many a rival in those distant places to which Heracles has wandered. But she has not allowed such knowledge to become a root of bitterness. She has fixed her thoughts on what is great and noble in her husband; on his loyalty to a hard task, his fortitude under a cruel destiny: of his inconstancies she has striven to think as of &lsquo;distempers,&rsquo; which love, and the discipline of sorrow, have taught her to condone.</p>
<p>But at last the trial comes in a sharper form. After protracted suspense, she is enraptured by tidings of her husband's  safety; and almost at the same moment she learns that his new mistress is henceforth to share her home. Even then her sweet magnanimity does not fail. Strong in the lessons of the past, she believes that she can apply them even here. She feels no anger against Iol&egrave;, no wish to hurt her; nay, Iol&egrave; is rather worthy of compassion, since she has been the innocent cause of ruin to her father's house.</p>
<p>In these first moments of discovery, the very acuteness of the pain produces a certain exaltation in Deianeira's mind. But, when she has had more time to think, she feels the difference between this ordeal and everything which she has hitherto suffered. She is as far as ever from feeling anger or rancour. But will it be possible to live under the same roof, while, with the slow months and years, her rival's youth grows to the perfect flower, and her own life passes into autumn? Thinking of all this, she asks&mdash;not, &lsquo;Could <title>I</title> bear it?&rsquo;&mdash;but, &lsquo;What woman could bear it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>She, whose patient self-control has sustained her so long, has come to a pass where it is a necessity of woman's nature to find some remedy. Neither Iol&egrave; nor Heracles shall be harmed; but she must try to reconquer her husband's love. Having decided to use the &lsquo;love-charm,&rsquo; she executes the resolve with feverish haste. The philtre is a last hope&mdash;nothing more. With visible trepidation, she imparts her plan to the Chorus. The robe has just been sent off, when an accident reveals the nature of the &lsquo;love-charm.&rsquo; &lsquo;Might she not have surmised this sooner,&rsquo; &mdash;it may be asked,&mdash;&lsquo;seeing from whom the gift came?&rsquo; But her simple faith in the Centaur's precepts was thoroughly natural and characteristic. Her thoughts had never dwelt on <emph>him</emph> or his motive; they were absorbed in Heracles. Now that her hope has been changed into terror, she tells the maidens, that, if Heracles dies, she will die with him. In the scene which follows, she speaks only once after Hyllus has announced the calamity, and then it is to ask where he had found his father.</p>
<p>Her silence at the end of her son's narrative,&mdash;when, with his curse sounding in her ears, she turns away to enter the house,&mdash; is remarkable in one particular among the master-strokes of tragic effect. A reader feels it so powerfully that the best acting  could scarcely make it more impressive to a spectator. The reason of this is worth noticing, as a point of the dramatist's art. When Hyllus ends his speech, we feel an eager wish that he could at once be made aware of his mother's innocence. The Chorus gives expression to our wish:&mdash;&lsquo;Why dost thou depart in silence?&rsquo; they say to Deianeira: &lsquo;Knowest thou not that thy silence pleads for thine accuser?&rsquo; And yet that silence is not broken.</p>
<p>There is one famous passage in Deianeira's part which has provoked some difference of opinion; and as it has a bearing on the interpretation of her character, a few words must be said about it here. It is the passage in which she adjures Lichas to disclose the whole truth regarding Iol&egrave;. He need not be afraid, she says, of any vindictiveness on her part, towards Iol&egrave; or towards Heracles. She knows the inconstancy of the heart, and the irresistible power of Er&ocirc;s; has she not borne with much like this before<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="1" resp="RCJ">Vv. 436&mdash;469.</note>? According to some critics, she is here practising dissimulation, in order to draw a confession from Lichas; her real feeling is shown for the first time when, a little later, she tells the Chorus that the prospect before her is intolerable (v. 545). This theory used to derive some apparent support from an error in the ordinary texts. The lines, or some of them, in which the Messenger upbraids Lichas with his deceit, were wrongly given to Deianeira,&mdash;as they are in the Aldine edition. Hence La Harpe could describe the whole scene thus:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Deianeira, irritated, reproaches Lichas with his perfidy; she knows all, and will have him confess it; we hear the cry of jealousy; <emph>she becomes enraged; she threatens.</emph> Then <emph>she pretends to calm herself</emph> by degrees; &lsquo;she had resented only the attempt to deceive her; for, in fact, she is accustomed to pardon her husband's infidelities.&rsquo; In the end, she manages so well that Lichas no longer feels bound to conceal a fact which after all,&mdash;as he says,&mdash;his master himself does not conceal<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="2" resp="RCJ">Quoted, with approval, by M. Patin, <emph>&Eacute;tudes sur les tragiques grecs</emph>, vol. 11. p. 72.</note>.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It is now generally recognised that Deianeira says nothing  between verse 400 and verse 436: the angry altercation is between Lichas and the Messenger. It would still be possible, however, to hold that, in her speech to Lichas, she is artfully disguising her jealousy. But surely there is a deeper truth to nature in those noble lines if we suppose that she means what she says to Lichas just as thoroughly as she means what she afterwards says to the Chorus. Only, when she is speaking to Lichas, she has not yet had time to realise all that the new trial involves; she overrates, in all sincerity, her own power of suffering. If, on the other hand, her appeal to him was a stratagem, then true dramatic art would have given some hint, though ever so slight, of a moral falsetto: whereas, in fact, she says nothing that is not true; for she <emph>does</emph> pity Iol&egrave;; she <emph>has</emph> borne much from Heracles; she does <emph>not</emph> mean to harm either of them. This is not the only instance in which Sophocles has shown us a courageous soul, first at high pressure, and then suffering a reaction; it is so with Antigone also, little as she otherwise resembles Deianeira<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="1" resp="RCJ">See Introduction to the <title>Antigone</title>, p. xxx.</note>.

<div2 id="cis12" type="section" n="12">
<p>The Heracles of the <title>Trachiniae</title> may be considered in <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Heracles.</note> two distinct aspects,&mdash;relatively to that conception of the hero which he represents, and relatively to the place which he holds in the action of the play.</p>
<p>In the first of these two aspects, the most significant point is the absence of any allusion to the hero's apotheosis. He is the son of Zeus; but the &lsquo;rest from labour&rsquo; which Zeus promised him is, in this play, death, and death alone. Here, then, we have the Homeric conception of Heracles. And this is in perfect harmony with the general tone of the <title>Trachiniae.</title> The spirit in which the legend of Heracles is treated in this play is essentially the epic spirit.</p>
<p>But if the very soul of the old Dorian tradition&mdash;the idea of immortality crowning mortal toil&mdash;is wanting, at least some archaic and distinctive traits of the Dorian hero have been preserved. One of these has perhaps not been noticed; it illustrates the poet's tact. In the legends of south Thessaly, Heracles had come to be much associated with Apollo. Yet in  the <title>Trachiniae</title> there is but one mention of Apollo,&mdash;where the Chorus briefly invokes him (v. 209). Throughout the play, Zeus is the god of Heracles, the ruler of his destiny, the sole recipient of his offerings. Nor is Delphi ever named; Heracles receives oracles either directly from Zeus, or from the interpreters of Zeus at Dodona. This is thoroughly true to the spirit of the myth; and it is probable that the Dorian conception of Heracles was, in fact, older than the Dorian cult of Apollo<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="1" resp="RCJ">Apollo is the chief god of the Dorians in the historical age; and O. M&uuml;ller (<title>Dor.</title>, bk 11.) regards him as having been so before they left their earliest seats in northern Greece. On the other hand Wilamowitz (<bibl>Eur. <title>Her.</title> 1. p. 265</bibl>) holds, with greater probability, that the adoption of the old Hellenic Apollo by the Dorians dated only from the time when, moving southward, they became masters of Delphi.</note>. The archaic conception of the hero's mission is also preserved in its leading features; he is the purger of land and sea, the common benefactor of Hellenes, who goes uncomplainingly whithersoever his fate leads him. Conscious of his origin, he fears no foe, and is stronger than everything except his own passions. He has a Dorian scorn for lengthy or subtle speech (<bibl n="Soph. Trach. 1211">1121</bibl>). It is bitter to him that sheer pain should force him to cry aloud: and he charges Hyllus that no lament shall be made by those who stand around his pyre. All this is in the strain of the old legend. One small touch recalls, for a moment, the Heracles of the satyr-plays (v. 268, <quote lang="greek">h(ni/k' h)=n w)|nwme/nos</quote>). On the other hand, the Omphal&egrave; incident, one of their favourite topics, is touched with delicate skill: Sophocles alludes only to the <emph>tasks</emph> done for her by the hero, as a punishment imposed by Zeus; there is no hint of sensuous debasement; and it is seen that the thrall was stung by his disgrace, even though that feeling was not the mainspring of his war upon Oechalia.</p>
<p>The Heracles of the <title>Trachiniae</title> is thus not merely <emph>a</emph> hero of tragedy, who might equally well have been called, let us say, Ajax. He has a stamp of his own; he can be recognised as the hero of the Dorians.</p>
<p>When, however, he is considered under the second of the two aspects indicated above,&mdash;that is, relatively to his place in the action of the play,&mdash;there is more room for criticism. During the first two-thirds of the piece, our interest is centred  in Deianeira. The sympathy which she wins is complete; she passes from the scene, broken-hearted, innocent, silent; and presently we hear the news of her death. Meanwhile, we have been rather prepossessed against Heracles; he is a great hero; but his conduct to this brave, devoted, gentle wife has been what, in another than the son of Zeus, might be called brutal; and let no one too hastily assume that such a feeling is peculiar to the modern mind; it would probably have been shared, at least in a very large measure, by the poet's Athenian audience.</p>
<p>So, when, in the last third of the play, this hero at length appears, unstrung and shattered by physical torment,&mdash;helpless in the meshes of fate,&mdash;when we listen to his pathetic laments, and to that magnificent recital of his past achievements which ends with the prayer that he may live to rend his false wife in pieces;&mdash;then we feel, indeed, all that is pitiable and terrible in this spectacle: but are there not many readers who, if they carried the analysis of their own feelings any further, would have to avow that the contemplation of his suffering and the thought of his past greatness leave them comparatively cold? Presently he learns that Deianeira was innocent, and that she is dead; but he utters no word in revocation of his judgment upon her,&mdash;no word of affection for her memory: he merely averts all his thoughts from her, and concentrates them on the preparation for death. It is not enough to plead that any softening would be out of keeping with the situation or with the man; we do not require him to be tender, but to be human. From a dramatic point of view, the fault is that he misses his chance of removing a great impediment to sympathy.</p>
<p>The Deianeira of the <title>Trachiniae</title> is dramatically effective in the very highest degree,&mdash;in a manner almost unique; the Heracles of the <title>Trachiniae</title>, though grandly conceived, falls short of being perfectly effective; and he does so, because he has to follow Deianeira. In a piece of which the catastrophe was to turn on the poisoned robe, and which was to end with the death of Heracles, that hero himself ought to have been the principal object of interest throughout. The artistic unity of the tragedy demanded this. But the Heracles of Dorian legend, even when  treated as mortal, is still no typical human being; he is at once above and below the noblest type of man. If, therefore, Heracles was truly to dominate the scene, it was requisite that the pathos of this unique being should not have to compete with the deepest pathos of humanity. For, in such a competition, the purely human interest, if fully developed by a great master, could not but prove the stronger, as being, in its essence, more tragic. And therefore there was only one way to secure a paramount effectiveness for the Heracles of the <title>Trachiniae.</title> It was to place Deianeira more in the background; to make her also a less noble figure; to qualify her graces of character with some less attractive features; and, on the other hand, to bring out, in the amplest and most powerful manner, everything that is sublime and pathetic in the great hero's destiny.</p>
<p>In pointing out what seems to me the one serious defect of the <title>Trachiniae</title>, a remark should be added. It is easy to believe that, on the stage, the Heracles part would be far more effective than it is for readers. &lsquo;As a representation of the extremity of a hero's suffering, this scene stands preeminent among all tragedies. Let Salvini act the hero, and its power would instantly be recognised.&rsquo; That was the opinion of an accomplished judge in such matters, the late Mr Fleeming Jenkin<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="1" resp="RCJ"><bibl><title>Papers Literary, Scientific</title>, etc., by the late Fleeming Jenkin, F.R.S., LL. D., p. 23. (Longmans, 1887.)</bibl></note>; and I, for one, certainly should not dispute it. The intrinsic merits of the Heracles part are great; and a Salvini, or even an actor who was not quite a Salvini, could, no doubt, make the spectacle most impressive. But, even if he could make it absorbing&mdash;so that we should think only of what was passing before our eyes, and not at all of what had gone before in the play, the episode of Deianeira&mdash;that might be merely an instance of theatrical effect prevailing over the dramatic conscience. It would not necessarily prove that the tragedy, viewed as a work of art,&mdash;and therefore viewed as a whole,&mdash;was not really liable to the criticism suggested above. However effective the Heracles scene might be on the stage, I cannot help suspecting that an attentive spectator, in full sympathy with the spirit of the best Greek work, would be apt to  feel, <emph>at the end</emph>, that he had seen two tragedies; one, which closed with the death of Deianeira, and was of consummate excellence; then a second and shorter one, most pathetic, most powerful in its own way, but produced at a moral disadvantage. Yet, if this be indeed so, there is one consolation. A gain to the effect of the Heracles would have been dearly bought by any detriment to the unsurpassable beauty of the Deianeira.

<div2 id="cis13" type="section" n="13">
<p>Among the secondary parts, that of Hyllus has an im- <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Hyllus.</note> portance which might easily be undervalued. It is he who most vividly expresses the twofold aspect of Deianeira's action in sending the robe; the aspect which it wears for one who has seen only its dreadful result, without knowing its motive; and that which it assumes in the light of fuller knowledge. The first aspect is brought out when Hyllus describes the agonies of Heracles, and invokes a curse upon his mother; the second when, having learned her innocence and having stood beside her corpse, he has to listen to his father's denunciations of her&mdash;so like those which he himself was lately uttering&mdash;until a pause permits him to vindicate her memory. This frank, impulsive youth is warmly loyal to both parents; to the gentle and dearly loved mother, whom he mourns too late; and to the father, &lsquo;the noblest man upon the earth,&rsquo; whose hard commands he obeys to the end, although those commands challenge a revolt of filial, even of natural, instincts,&mdash;seeming to him, indeed, almost like the promptings of At&egrave;. Thus, under that dark shadow, pierced by no ray from above, which rests upon the close of the drama, this thrice-tried son calls the gods to witness that his own will has been overruled. With bitter anguish in his heart, he sees his father abandoned, as men must deem, by heaven; he is no longer the buoyant youth of the opening scene, but a man who must now take up the burden of a great inheritance, that Hyllus whom a grave and warlike race were to honour as the father of their kings, the ancestor of the Dorian Heracleidae.

<p>The minor persons are portrayed with care and ani- <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">The minor persons.</note> mation. Lichas is, before all things, the faithful henchman of Heracles; but, like every one else, he feels the charm of  Deianeira, and is feebly anxious to spare her feelings. His well-meant attempt is somewhat maladroit, since he has already been so communicative to her neighbours; but we remark the ingenuity of the poet, who has here utilised the varying traditions as to the motive of the war against Oechalia. Lichas exists only for his master; and there is a tragic fitness in his becoming the first victim of his master's fate. It would be a mistake to conceive his death as a poetical retribution for his duplicity; since, even if he had told the truth at first, Deianeira would still have sent the robe. At worst he is only a rather poor creature, who becomes involved in the doom of his betters.</p>
<p>The Messenger, with his interested zeal, afterwards dignified by his sturdy veracity, combines the traits of two similar persons in the <title>Oedipus Tyrannus</title>,&mdash;the Corinthian messenger, and the Theban shepherd who confutes him. The old Nurse, who counsels Deianeira in the first scene, and subsequently relates her death, interprets the affection which her mistress inspired in <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">The Chorus.</note>the household. As for the Trachinian maidens of the Chorus, their part is essentially relative to Deianeira; to them she confides her fears, or hopes; their odes reflect her anxieties, her transient joy, and her despair. With her death, their function is virtually at an end; after verse 970, they have only two utterances, both very brief (1044 f.; 1112 f.).</p>
<p><note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">The incident of the robe.</note></p></div2>
<div2 id="cis15" type="section" n="15">
<p>Among the difficulties of detail which the subject presented to a dramatist, not the least was that of the supposed &lsquo;love-charm.&rsquo; The operation of the hydra's venom, like that of the poison in the wound of Philoctetes, is supernatural. Since, however, an innocent yet deliberate human agent intervenes between Nessus and Heracles, the poet was compelled to treat the incident with circumstance, and to invest it with just enough probability for the purpose of scenic effect. Sophocles has managed this by a simple but skilful device. He merely makes an assumption which no spectator would pause to examine. &lsquo;The hydra's venom was such that <emph>exposure to heat</emph> must call it into activity.&rsquo; All is then easy. Nessus tells Deianeira that his gift, this infallible love-charm, must be kept in a cool and dark place. She tells us how scrupulously she  had observed this rule. She impresses it upon Lichas. The spectator knows that the robe is to be worn for the first time on an occasion of <emph>burnt sacrifice;</emph> and his anxiety is awakened.</p>
<p>It is interesting to compare this episode with the parallel <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Comparison with the <title>Medea.</title></note> one in the <title>Medea</title>, where Glauc&egrave;, Jason's new bride, is burnt to death by the magic agency of the robe and diadem which Medea, the injured wife, had given her. We see at once that Euripides had a far easier task than Sophocles. No third person, no innocent yet deliberate agent, intervenes between Medea and Glauc&egrave;. The gifts come to Glauc&egrave; directly from the hands of the mighty enchantress; and they had come to the enchantress from her grandsire, the Sun-god himself.</p>
<p>The garment of Heracles, like that of Glauc&egrave;, has naturally <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Supposed solar imagery.</note> been claimed for the wardrobe of the solar myth. It is the glow which enwraps the dawn or the sunset. Then Iol&egrave; is &lsquo;the violet cloud&rsquo; who is to marry the rising sun (Hyllus), when his precursor (Heracles) has sunk to rest upon a flaming couch. The servitude to Omphal&egrave; is the apparent descent of the sun (Heracles) from the zenith to the horizon. Deianeira is the darkness which awaits him in the west. Thus to explain a story of varied human pathos, is at least to begin at the wrong end: it is to suppose myth-makers so intent on the sunrise and the sunset that men and women interested them primarily as symbols of those phenomena. Even the more limited theory, that Heracles was evolved from some older solar divinity, ill agrees with the central point of the fable,&mdash;promotion, painfully won, from earth to heaven. Later Greeks identified their Heracles, in certain aspects, with Melkarth, the sun-god of Tyre: some moderns have derived him from Izdubar, the solar hero of ancient Babylon<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="1" resp="RCJ">This view is sensibly rejected by  MeyerE. , <title>Geschichte des Alterthums</title> (Stuttgart, 1884), p. 185.</note>. In both cases the analogy is confined to details: the essence of the Greek myth remains distinct.

<p>The allusions in the <title>Trachiniae</title> to oracles concerning <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">The oracles.</note> Heracles have sometimes been censured as obscure. But they are not really so. Only two oracles are mentioned. (1) One was given to Heracles at Dodona, twelve years before the date at which the play begins, and said that, at the end of twelve years,  he should have &lsquo;rest.&rsquo; The term of twelve years is mentioned in verses 824 f. (where see the note). (2) The other oracle, noticed only in vv. 1159 ff., was given to Heracles by Zeus himself, at some still earlier moment; but when, and where, we are not told. It concerned the <emph>manner</emph> of his death; saying that he was to be slain by a dead foe. These oracles have sometimes been regarded as if they formed the only bond which holds the plot together; and it has accordingly been objected to the plot that its unity is of a merely mechanical nature<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="1" resp="RCJ"><bibl>Wilamowitz, Eur. <title>Her.</title> 1. p. 384</bibl>: <quote lang="de">&lsquo;das drama nur k&uuml;mmerlich durch orakelspr&uuml;che zu einer &auml;usserlichen einheit zusammengehalten wird.&rsquo;</quote></note>. The objection is ill-founded. The oracles have, indeed, a dramatic value, but it is of a different and a subordinate kind. At the outset of the play, the oracle concerning the twelve-years' term serves as a motive for anxiety; it announces that some crisis is imminent. Towards the close, the two oracles combined show Heracles that his hour has come.</p>
<p><note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Dramatic structure.</note></p></div2>
<div2 id="cis17" type="section" n="17">
<p>But the unity of the plot is independent of the oracles. It is effected by the love of Heracles for Iol&egrave;, which causes him to destroy Oechalia, and also causes Deianeira to send the robe; thus bringing the two episodes into a strict connection. Professor Campbell is, in my opinion, quite right when he says that &lsquo;in point of dramatic structure the Trachiniae will bear comparison with the greatest of Sophoclean tragedies.&rsquo; For, even if, as I hold, the inferiority in dramatic interest of Heracles to Deianeira is such as to constitute a serious defect, this is not a defect of structure. It does not concern the manner in which the plot has been put together. It concerns something antecedent to the plot; namely, the conception of Heracles adopted by the poet, as compared with his conception of Deianeira. Given those two conceptions, the most perfect dramatic structure could not save the interest in Heracles from being overpowered by the interest in Deianeira.</p>
<p><note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Unity of time neglected.</note>There is, however, one point in which the texture of the plot is fairly open to criticism, though it is not a point of importance. The &lsquo;unity of time&rsquo; has been disregarded with exceptional boldness. Hyllus goes to Euboea, witnesses the sacrifice there, and returns to Trachis, in a space of time measured by less than  700 lines (vv. 93&mdash;734). Nay, Lichas, who leaves Trachis at verse 632, had reached Euboea before the sacrifice began. Many other examples show the habitual laxity of Greek dramatists, and the tolerance of Greek audiences, in this particular. But in the <title>Trachiniae</title> the license has a special excuse. Amid the excitement, the alternations of hope and fear, which pervade this play, the action hastens forward in a manner which leaves us no leisure to remark the feats of travelling performed by Hyllus and by Lichas. This is the case even with readers; much more would it be so with spectators. And here we may observe the subtlety of the poet, who has introduced two direct allusions to the passage of time. Lichas, about to start for Euboea, remarks that he has already stayed too long (v. 599); and the Chorus prays that the ship which is bringing Heracles &lsquo;may not tarry&rsquo; (v. 655). This is like the art of a diplomatist who diverts suspicion by apparent frankness.

<div2 id="cis18" type="section" n="18">
<p>After the two dramas of the Attic masters, Heracles <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Seneca's <title>Hercules Oetaeus.</title></note> appears only once in the extant literature of ancient Tragedy. Seneca founded his <title>Hercules Furens</title> on the play of Euripides, and his <title>Hercules Oetaeus</title> on the play of Sophocles. It would be profitless to institute a detailed comparison between the <title>Trachiniae</title> and a work which Seneca, in the fashion of his day, composed rather as a rhetorical exercise than as a piece for the stage. Those who read it, with the Greek model present to their minds, can only wonder how the Roman's brilliant gifts of expression, &mdash;which shine in epigram and, at moments, reach a true elevation of sentiment,&mdash;could co-exist with such abject tastelessness, such extravagance of bombast, such insensibility to proportion. Yet, in one respect, a comparison is very interesting. If the Phaedra of the <title>Hippolytus</title> has fared ill at Seneca's hands, far worse is the transformation which he has effected in the Deianeira of the <title>Trachiniae.</title> The following lines describe <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">The Latin Deianeira</note> Deianeira's behaviour when Iol&egrave; first arrives at Trachis:&mdash;

O. 436">Ib. 436.</bibl></note>. Certainly Seneca has protected our sympathy with the hero from competition; but the hero himself, bragging and whining by turns, fails to profit by that advantage. The <title>Hercules Oetaeus</title> became the model of Rotrou, in his tragedy entitled <title>Hercule Mourant</title><note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="3" resp="RCJ">Published in 1632. Rotrou gave Heracles a successful rival in the affections of Iol&egrave;, a certain Arcas. The dying hero forbade Iol&egrave; to marry Arcas; but, after his apotheosis, he showed his magnanimity by descending from Olympus on purpose to revoke the veto.</note>; and also influenced, in a greater or less degree, several other French dramas on the same theme<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="4" resp="RCJ"><bibl>M. Patin, <title>Etudes sur les trag. grecs</title>, vol. II. p. 89.</bibl></note>. It was inevitable that the Latin writer, rather than Sophocles, should be imitated by a French dramatist of the seventeenth century. Apart from this, however, the Deianeira of Seneca, considered as a general type, would be more truly congenial to the French stage. It was difficult for the Latin races to imagine a woman, supplanted in her husband's love, who did not wish to kill somebody,&mdash;her rival, or her husband, or both. Ovid's Deianeira is by no means so bad as Seneca's; but she, too, has the impulse to destroy Iol&egrave;<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="5" resp="RCJ"><bibl n="Ov.

The Deianeira of the <title>Trachiniae</title>, with anguish in her soul,&mdash;intent on regaining her lord's heart, but not angry, not malevolent towards him or towards Iol&egrave;,&mdash;this Deianeira is a creation of the Hellenic spirit, refined by the sweetness, the purity, the restrained strength of Athens at her best; if any one would see the spiritual kinswomen of this Deianeira, he must look for them on the grave-reliefs of the Cerameicus.</p>
<p><note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">The fable </note></p></div2>
<div2 id="cis19" type="section" n="19">
<p>The wide range of subjects or motives which the Heracles legends gave to Greek art of every period includes, of course, several episodes mentioned in the <title>Trachiniae;</title>&mdash;the combat of Heracles with Achelo&uuml;s; the death of Nessus; Heracles with the Eurytidae; the death of Iphitus; the servitude to Om phal&egrave;<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="1" resp="RCJ">See Roscher's <title>Lexicon der gr. und r&ouml;m. Mythologie</title>, where, under &lsquo;Herakles,&rsquo; the illustrations of the fable in art are fully treated by  FurtwA. &auml;ngler. He recognises Iphitus on a vase in the Louvre (no. 972), where Heracles is hurling a man from a <quote lang="greek">kli/nh</quote>, apparently during a meal (p. 2233). Cp.  <bibl n="Hom.

Sophocles follows the version according to which Iphitus was hurled from a high wall or tower ( <bibl n="Soph.

But, in relation to the legends of Heracles, Attic Tragedy, represented by the <title>Mad Heracles</title> and the <title>Trachiniae</title>, had no direct influence upon art, such as can be traced, for instance, in regard to Philoctetes. For the story of Heracles, artists drew upon other, generally older, sources of poetry or tradition. When, indeed, in Hellenistic and Roman times a degenerate Heracles became the type of a strong man easily enthralled by pleasure, a companion of the Bacchic thiasos or of the Er&ocirc;tes<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="2" resp="RCJ">See Furtw&auml;ngler, <emph>ap.</emph> Roscher, p. 2248.</note>, then the art which desired to portray him often went for material to the theatre; but such material was furnished by the Heracles of Comedy or of satyr-drama. It is not surprising, then, that the illustrations of the <title>Trachiniae</title> which Greek art affords are only of a general kind. For example, each of the three successive forms assumed by the Achelo&uuml;s of the <title>Trachiniae</title>, when he was a suitor for Deianeira, can be separately identified in works of art<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="3" resp="RCJ">See commentary on v. 11.</note>. But, though the fight of Heracles with Achelo&uuml;s was a subject often treated by artists, no extant representation of that combat corresponds precisely with the scene as described by Sophocles<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="4" resp="RCJ">The nearest approach to an illustration of the poet's text is given by an archaic gem, now in the British Museum, first published (roughly) in King's <title>Ancient Gems</title>, II. pl. 34, fig. 3. Mr   Murray S. has kindly given me an impression of it. Yet even this diverges from Sophocles in three particulars. (1) On the gem, Achelo&uuml;s is the man-headed bull,&mdash;a frequent type, but not one of those specified by the poet. (2) Deianeira stands lamenting, close to the combatants; whereas the poet describes her as sitting by a hill at some distance from the fray. (3) There is no trace of Aphrodit&egrave;, whom Sophocles mentions as present with the combatants in the quality of umpire.</note>.

<div2 id="cis20" type="section" n="20">
<p>We have now considered the nature of the legendary <note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Diction.</note> material used in the <title>Trachiniae;</title> the character of the treatment  applied to it by the poet; and the principal features of the tragedy viewed as a work of dramatic art. An introduction to this play must also, however, take account of its style in a more limited sense,&mdash;the style of its poetical diction, the complexion of the language. For the details of this subject, reference must necessarily be made to the commentary on the text. But a few general observations may properly be offered here.</p>
<p><note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Successive phases in the style of Sophocles.</note>It is a well-attested tradition, and one which can still be partially verified, that the style of Sophocles, like that of many other great poets, was developed through successive phases, belonging to successive periods of his life. He himself, according to Plutarch<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="1" resp="RCJ">  <title>Mor.</title>p. 79  B. (<quote lang="greek">*pw=s a)/n tis ai)/sqoito e(autou= proko/ptontos e)p' a)reth=|</quote>, c. 7.) <quote lang="greek">w(/sper ga\r o( *sofoklh=s e)/lege to\n *ai)sxu/lou diapepaixw\s o)/gkon, e&lt;*&gt;ta to\ pikro\n kai\ kata/texnon th=s au(tou= kataskeuh=s, tri/ton h)/dh to\ th=s le/cews metaba/llein e&lt;*&gt;dos o(/per e)sti\n h)qikw/taton kai\ be/ltiston, ou(/tws oi( filosofou=ntes, o(/tan e)k tw=n panhgurikw=n kai\ katate/xnwn ei)s to\n a(pto/menon h)/qous kai\ pa/qous lo/gon katabw=sin, a)/rxontai th\n a)lhqh= prokoph\n kai\ a)/tufon proko/ptein</quote>.</note>, distinguished three such phases. In the earliest, he had imitated the majesty, the pomp,&mdash;<quote lang="greek">o)/gkos</quote>,&mdash;of Aeschylus. Next came the style which, in Plutarch's notice, is described by the words, <quote lang="greek">to\ pikro\n kai\ kata/texnon th=s au(tou= kataskeuh=s</quote>. This was a style marked by subtle elaboration, and, as a result of it, by <quote lang="greek">to\ pikro/n</quote>, &lsquo;pungency,&rsquo; &lsquo;incisiveness&rsquo;; a style in which terse and polished force of expression drove home the &lsquo;sting&rsquo; of word or phrase;&mdash;as Eupolis,&mdash;to borrow an illustration from a different, yet cognate, province,&mdash;said that the incisive and highly wrought oratory of Pericles left its &lsquo;sting&rsquo; in the minds of those who heard him: <quote lang="greek">to\ ke/ntron e)gkate/lipe toi=s a)krowme/nois</quote>. Such a style, with its affinities to an elevated and refined rhetoric, can be a source of great brilliancy and power in poetry; but its essential quality is not that which constitutes the highest excellence of drama: its defect, for the purposes of drama, is that it is too suggestive of conscious effort in the artist; its tendency is to image <emph>his</emph> mind somewhat too strongly in the persons whom he wishes to make live upon the scene. Hence we readily comprehend the words in which Sophocles (according to Plutarch) defined the third, the final, phase of his style;&mdash;<quote lang="greek">to\ th=s le/cews ei)=dos o(/per e)sti\n h)qikw/taton kai\ be/ltiston</quote>: &lsquo;the kind of diction  which is most expressive of character, and best&rsquo;; that is, fittest to make each person of the drama seem a real human being; and best, therefore, for the purposes of a dramatist.</p>
<p>The first of these three phases, the Aeschylean, is not traceable in the extant work of Sophocles. Nor can it be said that any one of the seven tragedies represents the second style in a form which sharply distinguishes it from the third; that is, in a form from which the characteristic quality of the third style is absent. But, if the <title>Philoctetes</title>, one of the very latest plays (409 B.C.), be taken as a standard of comparison, there, at least, is seen the perfection of the third style, the style which is &lsquo;expressive of character&rsquo;; while there is less of visible and masterful art in language, less of <quote lang="greek">to\ pikro\n kai\ kata/texnon</quote>, than appears, for example, in the <title>Antigone.</title>

It is exquisitely moulded to the expression of her nature. Take, again, the scene where the Messenger, in Deianeira's presence, taxes Lichas with deceit (vv. 393&mdash;435). The shades of language most skilfully characterise the three persons,&mdash;the gentle but resolute lady; the herald, nervously deferential to her, but angrily assertive of his dignity against his humble cross-examiner, the Messenger; and lastly the Messenger himself, with his traits of blunt or familiar speech<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="1" resp="RCJ">One of these traits is notable,&mdash;the <quote lang="greek">poi/an do/khsin</quote>; (427). This use of <quote lang="greek">poi=os</quote>, a common colloquialism, occurs in only one other passage of Tragedy, and that is in a late play of Euripides (<title>Helen.</title> 566; 412 B.C.).</note>. In this aspect, then, the <title>Trachiniae</title> shows, like the <title>Philoctetes</title>, the full excellence of the third style,&mdash;that which is <quote lang="greek">h)qikw/taton</quote>, &lsquo;most expressive of character.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But the <title>Trachiniae</title> combines this ethical charm of style with a highly elaborate manner in a certain class of passages. Every Greek tragedy contains at least one set speech, <quote lang="greek">r(h=sis</quote>, of the type usually spoken by a messenger who relates a catastrophe. In such speeches, which were really short excursions of drama into the region of epos, the dramatist was convention ally free to use any measure of rhetorical elaboration, however unsuitable it might be to the person of the speaker; some of the most elaborate <quote lang="greek">r(h/seis</quote> are delivered by servants. Now, it is a peculiarity of the <title>Trachiniae</title> that, beside two speeches which are normal examples of this class,&mdash;the speech of Hyllus (vv. 749&mdash;812), and that of the Nurse (vv. 899&mdash;946),&mdash;it contains a remarkable number of other passages which are closely akin to that class. Such are the following short narratives;&mdash;Lichas recounts the recent deeds of his master (248&mdash;290); Deianeira relates her meeting with Nessus (531&mdash;587); and describes the occurrence which rouses her fears concerning the &lsquo;love-charm&rsquo; (672&mdash;722): such, also, is the great speech of Heracles (1046&mdash; 1111). Altogether, about one fourth of the play consists of passages which invited or demanded this high elaboration of style, usually reserved for very exceptional moments. It is no accident that the element of narrative in the <title>Trachiniae</title> is so abnormally large; the cause lies in the nature of the fable itself, and is independent of the circumstance that an epic poem, the <title>Capture of Oechalia</title>, was probably one of the chief sources. In narrative or description Sophocles exhibits, as a rule, two characteristics; he is remarkably terse; and he has a bold but artistic originality of phrase, often in a manner which resembles that of Vergil. If the passages just cited from the <title>Trachiniae</title> are compared with their only proper analogues, the set <quote lang="greek">r(h/seis</quote> of the poet's other plays, it will be felt that, with allowance for differences of degree, the essential quality of style is the same; the greater frequency of it is the distinction of the <title>Trachiniae.</title> This play, like the <title>Philoctetes</title>, is mainly an example of that Sophoclean manner which tradition calls the third or ripest,&mdash;the manner &lsquo;best fitted to express character.&rsquo; But, owing to special causes, it also gives striking prominence to the dominant trait of the poet's &lsquo;second&rsquo; manner, elaborate and incisive force of phrase,&mdash;<quote lang="greek">to\ pikro\n kai\ kata/texnon</quote>. This is a peculiar combination of elements; and it tends to make a reader feel that the style of the <title>Trachiniae</title> is somehow, as a whole, unlike the style found in any one of the other six plays. From that feeling, it has been an easy, but hasty, step to the inference that the manner of this play is unworthy of the master; that it  shows the immaturity of youth, or the feebleness of age; or even that it is altogether foreign to him, and must have proceeded from some inferior hand<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="1" resp="RCJ">See above, &sect; 1, notes 1, 2, 3.</note>.

<p>The extent to which the <title>Trachiniae</title> shows the influ-<note anchored="yes" place="marg" resp="RCJ">Supposed influence of Euripides.</note> ence of Euripides has sometimes been exaggerated. Stress has been laid especially on the form of the prologue; Deianeira opens the play with a speech of some length, in which she incidentally relates certain previous events. But here we must distinguish. The prologue of the <title>Trachiniae</title> is Euripidean only in so far as it is partly historical; it is utterly unlike the typical prologues of Euripides in being dramatic. For, in the first place, Deianeira's speech is no soliloquy,&mdash;though it is true that she is rather communing with her own thoughts than directly addressing the Nurse; it gives the cue for the Nurse's suggestion that Hyllus should be sent to seek his father, and thus serves to set the drama in motion. Secondly, it is dramatic as illustrating the mind of Deianeira herself,&mdash;that mind which is to govern the subsequent action<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="2" resp="RCJ">Schlegel's criticism (&sect; 1, n. 3) was the inspiration of a short &lsquo;programm&rsquo; published at Cleve (Prussia) in 1830 by C.  M. AxtA. , <title>Commentatio critica qua Trachiniarum Sophocleae prologum subdititium esse demonstratur.</title> Axt uses the term &lsquo;prologue,&rsquo; not in the Greek sense (i.e. to denote vv. 1&mdash;93), but only with reference to Deianeira's speech, vv. 1&mdash;48. He holds that the play ought to begin at v. 49, with the speech of the <quote lang="greek">trofo/s</quote>.</note>. Even with regard to this prologue, the inner contrast between the two poets is more significant than the resemblance. Nor can it be said that the general style of the play shows any pervading influence of the supposed kind. There are a few coincidences of phrase between verses of the <title>Trachiniae</title> and verses of Euripides<note anchored="yes" place="foot" n="3" resp="RCJ">(1)  <bibl n="Soph.

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">*pleurw=ni</lemma>. The ancient Pleuron stood in a fertile plain of Aetolia, near the mountain called <quote lang="greek">*kou/rion</quote>, a few miles  W.N.W. of Calydon. About 230 B.C. that site was deserted, and a new Pleuron was founded more to the S.W., not far from the modern Mesolonghi. (<bibl n="Strab. 10.451">Strabo 10. 451</bibl>: <bibl>Leake, <title>North. Gr.</title> I. 115 ff.</bibl>) In the <title>Iliad</title> Pleuron figures among the chief Aetolian towns (2. 639, with four others: 13. 217, with Calydon only).</p>
<p>Calydon was usually represented as the seat of Oeneus ( <bibl n="Hom.

The inverted order of the words (&lsquo;chiasmus&rsquo;) has its usual effect for the ear,&mdash;viz., to indi cate that <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">flogizo/menon</lemma> balances <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">e)narizome/na</lemma>, as <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">kateuna/zei</lemma> balances <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ti/ktei</lemma>. And this is so, if <quote lang="greek">e)narizo&lt;*&gt;e/na</quote> implies, not only &lsquo;slain,&rsquo; but &lsquo;despoiled,&rsquo;&mdash;thus serving, with  <quote lang="greek">ai)o/la</quote>, to suggest that bright panoply which Night is still wearing when the Dawn comes to vanquish her,&mdash;ere the Sun-god has yet issued from her womb.

<p>The text has been much suspected (see cr. n.), but without reason. The imagery, indeed, does not form a consistent whole: Night is slain, and then overcomes. But this is merely one of many instances in which the poet's language wavers between the figurative and the literal.</p>

With <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">*krh/sion</lemma> cp.  <title>C.</title> 1. 26. 1 ff. The image is that of a strong swimmer buffeting a rough sea. One wave twists him aside (<lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">stre/fei</lemma>) from his course: the next sweeps him onward, lifting him on its crest. It is characteristic of Sophocles that, in the second clause, he has preferred <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">au)/cei</lemma> to <quote lang="greek">ai)/rei</quote>, through thinking of that which the <emph>uplifting</emph> wave figures,&mdash; viz., the <emph>honour</emph> won by the hero. For the omission of <quote lang="greek">to\ me/n</quote> (implied by <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">to\ d)</lemma>) before <quote lang="greek">stre/fei</quote>, cp.  <bibl n="Hom.

It is therefore necessary, as it is easy, to supply <quote lang="greek">pe/lagos</quote> from what follows.</p>
<p>Among those who receive <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">stre/fei</lemma> (due to Reiske) are Dindorf, Nauck, Wecklein, Hartung. The last-named, however, takes it as = &lsquo;overturns,&rsquo; referring it to the swimmer being <emph>plunged down</emph> into the trough of the sea. For this sense of <quote lang="greek">stre/fein</quote>, see on  <bibl n="Soph. OC 1453"> <title>O. C.</title>1453</bibl> f. But here the idea of &lsquo;turning aside or back&rsquo; better suits the image of reverses alternating with triumphs. <quote lang="greek">stre/fein</quote> was said of the wrestler who &lsquo;twists back&rsquo; his foe (Pollux 3. 155: cp. <quote lang="greek">a)postre/yas</quote> in   <bibl n="Aristoph. Kn. 264">Ar. <title>Eq.</title>264</bibl>).</p>
<p>As to the MS. <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">tre/fei</lemma>, we may observe:&mdash;(1)   <bibl n="Eur. Hipp. 367">Eur. <title>Hipp.</title>367</bibl><quote lang="greek">w)= po/noi tre/fontes brotou/s</quote> may fairly be quoted to show that the sense here might be, &lsquo;troubles make up the life of Heracles.&rsquo; (2) But the context seems to show that,  instead of this, we require a word (<emph>a</emph>) which shall convey the idea of <emph>vexing</emph>, and (<emph>b</emph>) which can be opposed to <quote lang="greek">au)/cei</quote>.

<p>Hense (whom Nauck follows) thinks that this second antistrophe (122&mdash;131) requires to be transposed, so as to become the second strophe, immediately following v. 111. But this change is worse than unnecessary. It is liable to the fatal objection that vv. 132 ff.

<p>(1) It is a gen. of connection, equiv. to the gen. with <quote lang="greek">peri/</quote>, and going with the whole phrase <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ei(marme/na e)kteleuta=sqai</lemma> rather than with either word alone. &lsquo;He said that such things were destined to be  accomplished <emph>in regard to</emph> the toils of Heracles.&rsquo; This is only a rarer and bolder form of the gen. used in poetry after verbs of &lsquo;speaking <emph>about</emph>&rsquo; ( <bibl n="Soph.

<p>(2) It is also possible, though less probable, that the gen. should be taken as partitive with <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">e)kteleuta=sqai</lemma>: destined to be accomplished as part of (in the number of) his toils.

The signs were taken from the movement and rustling of the oak's leaves; and these signs were interpreted by the priestesses called <quote lang="greek">*peleia/des</quote>. Cp. fr. 414 <quote lang="greek">ta\s qespiw|dou\s i(eri/as *dwdwni/das</quote>. Euripides spoke of three such priestesses; but Pindar, like Sophocles, gave the number as two (schol. here). In saying that the oak &lsquo;<emph>spake</emph>&rsquo; (<quote lang="greek">au)dh=sai</quote>) by their mouths, he follows the established mode of expression with regard to it.

<p>Others understand:&mdash;(1) &lsquo;by the agency of two doves&rsquo;: <foreign lang="la">i.e.</foreign>, the signs from the oak were somehow combined with, or explained by, signs derived from birds. (2) &lsquo;The oak spake from between two doves&rsquo;; <foreign lang="la">i.e.</foreign> a symbolical dove, of stone or metal, stood on either side of the tree. The Appendix will show what can be said for or against each of these theories. Here  it may be noted that neither seems to accord so well with the phrase <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">au)dh=sai e)k</lemma>. It was through the inspired <emph>lips</emph> that the utterance of the oak became a &lsquo;voice.&rsquo;</p>

<p>This is one of those passages in which the manner of Sophocles recalls that of Vergil. The general meaning is simple and clear&lt;*&gt; but a verbal analysis demands the nicest care.

<p> This lively &lsquo;dance-song&rsquo; (<quote lang="greek">u(po/rxhma</quote>) is the direct response of the Chorus to Deianeira's appeal (202 <quote lang="greek">fwnh/sat)</quote>),&mdash;expressing their delight at the good news. As Dr. W. Christ, who calls it &lsquo;a paean to Artemis and Apollo,&rsquo; justly remarks (<title>Metrik</title> &sect; 443), its contents clearly point to a distribution of the verses between different singers. (1) The first part, down to v. 215 (<quote lang="greek">*nu/mfas</quote>), is an invitation to song and dance; this would be given either by the coryphaeus, or by the leader of one semichorus. (2) The second part, vv. 216&mdash;220 (<quote lang="greek">a)ei/rom)...a(/millan</quote>), is the response, delivered by the leader of the other semichorus. (3) Then, at v. 221, the whole Chorus joins in with the refrain of the paean, <quote lang="greek">i)w\ i)w\ *paia/n</quote>.  (4) The coryphaeus then gives the last three verses, which introduce the next scene.&mdash;For the metres, see Metrical Analysis.
</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">a)nololuca/tw</lemma> has been recognised by almost all recent critics and metrists as a certain correction of <quote lang="greek">a)nololu/cete</quote> (L) or <quote lang="greek">-ate</quote>. But I should keep the MS. <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">do/mois</lemma>, merely reading <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">a(</lemma> for <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">o(</lemma> with Erfurdt. The clue to a right interpretation here depends on two points in the context. (1) Deianeira has called for a joyous cry from the women <emph>in the house</emph>, and from those <emph>outside of it</emph> (203 f.). The first words of the Chorus accordingly appeal to the women <emph>in the house</emph>,&mdash;as is marked, not only by <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">do/mois</lemma>, but by <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">e)festi/ois</lemma>, adding that the <emph>men</emph> of the household are to join in. Then, at v. 210, <quote lang="greek">o(mou= de\...paia=n)...w)= parqe/noi</quote>, the maidens <emph>of the Chorus</emph> are invited to raise the paean. (2) The words <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">e)n de\ koino\s a)rse/nwn</lemma> <foreign lang="greek">k.t.l.</foreign> could not have been used unless a reference to <emph>women</emph> had <emph>preceded;</emph> it is not enough that it should <emph>follow</emph>, in <quote lang="greek">w)= parqe/noi</quote>, at v. 210.</p>
<p>Hence we have to choose between these views, of which I prefer the first. (1) <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">a( mello/numfos</lemma>, &lsquo;she whose nuptials are soon to come,&rsquo; is a poetical phrase for <emph>virgo nubilis</emph>, and denotes the maidens of the household generally. Nauck, reading <quote lang="greek">do/mois...<emph>o(</emph> mello/numfos</quote>, gives this sense to it, but admits that the masc. (&lsquo;<emph>quisquis</emph> nubilis est&rsquo;) is awkward: rather it is impossible. (2) <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">a( mello/numfos</lemma>=&lsquo;she who is soon to be (re-)united to a husband,&rsquo; <foreign lang="la">i.e.</foreign> Deianeira. This is a forcing of the Greek word which can easily be smoothed over in an English paraphrase, but which would probably have seemed very strange to a Greek. (3) Reading <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">do/mos &hellip; o( mello/numfos</lemma>, &lsquo;the household of maidens,&rsquo; <foreign lang="la">i.e.</foreign> &lsquo;the maidens of the household.&rsquo; This seems an untenable usage: moreover the metre condemns <quote lang="greek">do/mos</quote>.&mdash;Another version of this reading, &lsquo;the house which is soon to receive the husband,&rsquo; not only strains <quote lang="greek">mello/numfos</quote>, but fails to supply the necessary antithesis to <quote lang="greek">a)rse/nwn</quote>.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">a)nololuca/tw</lemma>: the <quote lang="greek">o)lolugh/</quote> or <quote lang="greek">o)lolugmo/s</quote> was a cry to the gods, usually expressive of joy or hope, in prayer or sacrifice: and it is especially said of women (<emph>e.g. </emph> <bibl n="Hom.

If the poet had made Heracles go to Lydia 39, instead of 15, months before his death, there would have been less room for those hopes which contend with fears in the opening scene of the <title>Trachiniae.</title>

Instances of zeugma quite as bold occur elsewhere in poetry; for the Greek mind was quick to seize the hint of a contrast, and did not always require full expression of it: <foreign lang="la">e.g.</foreign>,  <bibl n="Hom.

In these examples, just as here, the antithesis of nouns supersedes an explicit antithesis of verbs.</p>
<p>Others understand :&mdash;&lsquo;railed against him both with (rude) words and with evil intent.&rsquo; To this there are two objections. (1) Since <emph>all</emph> the supposed affronts are then verbal, the antithesis would require an epithet for <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">lo/gois</lemma> (such as <quote lang="greek">ai)sxroi=s</quote>), to balance <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">a)thra=|</lemma>. (2) The formula <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">polla\ me\n &hellip; polla\ de/</lemma> would be out of place, unless two classes of verbal taunts were distinguished by the presence or absence of a spiteful intent; but the context excludes such a distinction.</p>

The length of this ridge, from N. to S. , is about 328 yards: its width about 109. The upper citadel of Tiryns was at the southern end, where the rock attains a height of about 72 feet above sea-level, and of 59 feet above the present surface of the plain. North of this was the lower citadel; and the whole was surrounded by those massive &lsquo;Cyclopean&rsquo; walls from which Tiryns derived its Homeric epithet ( <bibl n="Hom. Il. 2.559"> <title>Il.</title>2. 559</bibl>), <quote lang="greek">teixio/essa</quote>. See Schliemann's <title>Tiryns</title>, p. 177.

The word <quote lang="greek">pu/rgos</quote> oft.=a city-wall with its towers ( <bibl n="Soph. OT 56"> <title>O. T.</title>56</bibl> n.). Thus it would satisfy all these statements to suppose that Iphitus was thrown from some high part of the walls which encompassed Tiryns <quote lang="greek">teixio/essa</quote>. And by <quote lang="greek">purgw/dhs pla/c</quote> Sophocles may well have meant  &lsquo;the summit of a tower-like <emph>building.</emph>&rsquo; Modern critics have usually held that he meant &lsquo;the top of a towering rock or cliff&rsquo;: and so the schol. here explains, <quote lang="greek">u(yhlou= o)/rous</quote>. We need not press the argument that it is not well-suited to the locality. But it may be doubted whether a Greek poet would have compared a rock or cliff to a <quote lang="greek">pu/rgos</quote> merely because it was high and steep. On the other hand, where <quote lang="greek">purgoeidh/s</quote> occurs elsewhere, it refers to a building. Josephus <title>Bell.

Dion Cassius 74. 5 <quote lang="greek">pura\ purgoeidh/s</quote>.

<p>The midd. <quote lang="greek">e)fi/stamai</quote> does not elsewhere occur in a causal sense (except in the aor., as   <bibl n="Xen.

<p>A fact which confirms this view is that <quote lang="greek">e)fista/nai, e)fi/stasqai</quote> were regularly used with ref. to a halt.   <bibl n="Xen.

If the text be sound, it means:&mdash;&lsquo;he makes war upon her country, that in which (Lichas) said that this Eurytus was master of the throne.&rsquo; But there are three difficulties:</p>
<p>(1) It was needless to say that the girl's <quote lang="greek">patri/s</quote> was also the realm of Eurytus: <bibl n="Soph. Trach. 244">cp. 244</bibl> f.: 283 ff.: 315. The excuse must be that the Messenger himself had not yet said so; he is wordy, and anxious, in his own fashion, to be lucid. The reading <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">to/nd)</lemma>, it may be noted, suits this view of him. And <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">tw=nd)</lemma> (<quote lang="greek">qro/nwn</quote>) would be very awkward.</p>
<p>(2) Heracles is subject to <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">e)pistrateu/ei</lemma> and <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ktei/nei</lemma>: but Lichas to <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ei)=pe</lemma>. (Heracles cannot be the subject to <quote lang="greek">ei)=pe</quote>: he needed not to tell his warriors that Eurytus <emph>reigned</emph> there; and, on the other hand, <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">despo/zein</lemma> could not mean, &lsquo;<emph>usurped.</emph>&rsquo;) Such a change of subject is very harsh: still, it is not impossible; and, as the <emph>narrative</emph> of Lichas has been the foremost topic so far, <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ei)=pe</lemma> would at once suggest him. An example almost as bold occurs in  <bibl n="Thuc.  2. 3">Thuc.2. 3</bibl>: <quote lang="greek">oi( de\ *plataih=s... lo/gous deca/menoi h(su/xazon, a)/llws te kai\ e)peidh\ e)s ou)de/na ou)de\n e)newte/rizon. pra/ssontes de/ pws tau=ta kateno/hsan k.t.l.</quote>: where the Plataeans are the subject of <quote lang="greek">h(su/xazon</quote> and <quote lang="greek">kateno/hsan</quote>, but the Thebans of <quote lang="greek">e)newte/rizon</quote>.</p>
<p>(3) At v. 377 Deianeira asks, <quote lang="greek">a)=r' a)nw/numos</quote> &verbar; <quote lang="greek">pe/fuken</quote><emph>; i.e.</emph>, &lsquo;is she of obscure birth?&rsquo;&mdash;and then, for the first time, learns that the girl's father is <title>Eurytus.</title> So she must have understood <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">a)/nakta</lemma> in 364 to mean, not &lsquo;the king,&rsquo; but some (minor) &lsquo;prince&rsquo; or &lsquo;chief.&rsquo; Yet, even so, her question at v. 377 is strange. (At v. 342 we saw that she ignored a hint given in v. 336: but on <emph>this</emph> question&mdash;the girl's birth&mdash;we should have expected her to be attentive.)</p>
<p>The only course which removes all these three difficulties is Hartung's,&mdash;who brackets the words <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">th\n tau/ths &hellip; pate/ra</lemma>, so that three verses shrink into one,&mdash; <quote lang="greek">e)pistrateu/ei patri/da th=sde, kai\ po/lin k.t.l.</quote> This would certainly improve the passage. And it is conceivable that the interpolation should have been due to actors.</p>
<p>Others read <foreign lang="greek"><emph>tw=n</emph> *eu)ru/tou <emph>to/nd'</emph></foreign>, rendering: &lsquo;in which (Lichas) said that Heracles (<quote lang="greek">to/nd)</quote>) holds&rsquo; [or &lsquo;wishes to hold&rsquo;] the throne of Eurytus.&rsquo; But Heracles simply laid Oechalia waste; there was no question of his reigning there.&mdash;Wecklein ingeniously reads <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">to\n e)rga/thn</lemma> (for <quote lang="greek">*eu)/ruton</quote>) <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">tw=nd)</lemma>: &lsquo;where Heracles said (to his warriors) that the author of these wrongs was king.&rsquo;</p>

<p>In some ancient texts this verse was given to Deianeira. Among recent editors, Paley shares that view.

(2) It agrees best with the practice of Sophocles to suppose that <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">h)= ka/rta</lemma> are a speaker's first words. &mdash;Some, indeed, of the MSS. (as B, K, T), which give v. 379 to Deianeira, have <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">h)\</lemma> instead of <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">h)=</lemma>, with the mark of interrogation after <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">fu/sin</lemma>, and only a comma after <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">diw/mnuto</lemma>.

<p>The comment is aimed at Lichas in the  first instance; but its vague form seems purposed, so that the hearers may extend it, if they please, to Heracles.

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">w(s o(ra=|s</lemma>. I receive this slight and easy correction of <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ei)sora=|s</lemma>, holding that the latter does not admit of any sound defence. Various explanations of it have been attempted. (1) Seidler: <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ei)sora=|s</lemma> governs the gen. No one would now maintain this: the alleged instances are irrelevant (  <bibl n="Aristoph. Frogs 815">Ar. <title>Ran.</title>815</bibl><quote lang="greek">pari/dh|</quote> with a gen. <emph>absol.</emph>:  <title>M.</title> 1. 1. 11 <quote lang="greek">ou)dei\s de\ tw/pote *swkra/tous ou)de\n a)sebe\s...ou)/te pra/ttontos ei)=den</quote>, etc., where the verb governs the acc., and the gen. is possessive). (2) Hermann: the constr. is, <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">w(s</lemma> (&lsquo;<emph>since</emph>&rsquo;), <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">e(/rpontos e)mou=, ei)sora=|s</lemma> (<quote lang="greek">tou=to, e(/rponta/ me</quote>). But <quote lang="greek">w(s</quote> must go with the gen. absol. (3) Nauck: <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">w(s e(/rpontos e)mou=</lemma>, (<quote lang="greek">ou(/tws</quote>) <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ei)sora=|s</lemma> (<quote lang="greek">e)me\ e(/rponta</quote>). But (<emph>a</emph>) this implies a harsh asyndeton (<quote lang="greek">di/dacon &mdash;ei)sora=|s</quote>): and (<emph>b</emph>) the constr. is not justified by  <bibl n="Soph.

(4) Matthiae: there is a confusion between <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ei)sora=|s w(s e(/rpontos e)mou=</lemma>, and <quote lang="greek">w(s</quote> (since) <quote lang="greek">ei)sora=|s e(/rponta eme/</quote>. (5) Dindorf: <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ei)sora=|s</lemma> is parenthetic. This is the best plea: but it does not suit the idiom of tragedy.

<p>This is a remarkable passage, and it is of some moment to understand it rightly. The meaning is not merely that Iol&egrave;'s relation to Heracles was excused by the omnipotence of Er&ocirc;s. Concubinage (<quote lang="greek">pallaki/a</quote>) was not merely tolerated by Athenian opinion, but, in some measure, protected by law (see <foreign lang="la">e.g.</foreign>, <bibl n="Lys. 1.31">Lys. or. 1 &sect; 31</bibl>: <bibl n="Isaeus 8.39">Isae. or. 8 &sect; 39</bibl>). Its relation to the life of the family is illustrated by the <title>Andromach&egrave;</title> of Euripides; for though Andromach&egrave; is Trojan, and Hermion&egrave; Spartan, the sentiments are Athenian. A wife (<quote lang="greek">gameth\ gunh/</quote>) who tolerates a <quote lang="greek">pallakh/</quote> is there represented as proving her goodness of heart (<quote lang="greek">a)reth/</quote>, 226), and her wise moderation (938&mdash;942); she ought to be consoled by her higher place, and by the advantage which her children will have over the <quote lang="greek">no/qoi</quote>.</p>
<p>But is Deianeira in earnest here; or is she feigning acquiescence, to reassure Lichas? Presently she tells the Chorus that she cannot endure to share her home with Iol&egrave; (539&mdash;546). Probably Sophocles meant her to be sincere in both places. The faith in her own power to bear the trial is natural at this moment of excitement and suspense. Not less so is the reaction, when she knows the worst, and has had time to think.

The number of his sons finally grew to about seventy, whose mothers are enumerated by Apollodorus (2. 7. 8).

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">e)ntakei/h tw=| filei=n</lemma>; the subject to the verb is surely Iol&egrave;. To make Heracles the subject is not impossible (Greek could be bold in such transitions),&mdash; but it would be excessively harsh. Deianeira has already implied that she believed Iol&egrave; to be enamoured of Heracles (444). Such a belief would mitigate,  rather than increase, the wife's pain. The opposite supposition would be still more humiliating; for it would imply more persistent ardour on the part of Heracles. And it is pathetically natural that Deianeira should assume Iol&egrave;'s passion as a matter of course.</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">e)ntakei/h</lemma> admits of two explanations: I prefer the first. (1) &lsquo;Though she be utterly <emph>absorbed in</emph> her love&rsquo;: lit., melted into it,&mdash;with her whole soul irrevocably steeped in it.

Marshes, due partly to the lake Melit&egrave;, insulated the hill on which the town stood, and made the site a strong one. The name was familiar to Athenians in the poet's time. Oeniadae was long a centre of anti-Athenian influence in western Greece. It was unsuccessfully besieged by Pericles (<bibl n="Thuc. 1.111">Th. 1. 111</bibl>, <date value="-454">454 B.C.</date>); but, under pressure from the other Acarnanian towns, was received into the Athenian alliance by Demosthenes in <date value="-424">424 B.C.</date> <bibl n="Thuc. 4.77">(Th. 4. 77)</bibl>. The site (now Tricardo) was first identified by Leake.</p>
<p>Oeniadae was some twelve miles W.S.W. of Pleuron. As Heracles arrives from his famous home to the east, so it is fitting that the river-god should come from the western town which was a chief seat of his worship. The head of the Achelo&uuml;s appears on coins of Oeniadae.

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">&dagger;e)gw\ de\ ma/thr&dagger; me\n oi(=a fra/zw</lemma>. The words <quote lang="greek">e)gw\ de\ ma/thr</quote> (if no others) are unquestionably corrupt. They have been explained to mean:&mdash;&lsquo;I speak as a mother&rsquo; (or &lsquo;her mother&rsquo;) &lsquo;might speak&rsquo;: <foreign lang="la">i.e.</foreign>, with all a mother's tender sympathy. If anything could increase the strangeness of such language, it would be the fact that the young maidens of Trachis are speaking of one who is old enough to be <emph>their</emph> mother. Or: (2) &lsquo;I tell the story as her mother told it,&rsquo;&mdash;a way of explaining how they can describe what they had not seen. This needs no refutation.</p>
<p>The true key to this passage depends on observing the sequence of topics. (1) In 517&mdash;522, <quote lang="greek">to/t' h)=n xero/s...sto/nos a)mfoi=n</quote>, we have a brief picture of the fight. (2) Then vv. 523&mdash;525, <quote lang="greek">a( d' eu)w=pis...a)koi/tan</quote>, mark Deianeira's suspense. (3) Next comes the obscure parenthesis, <quote lang="greek">e)gw\ de\...fra/zw</quote>. (4) And then we <emph>return</emph>, at v. 527, to Deianeira's suspense,&mdash;not, however, in a form which adds anything new to vv. 523 &mdash;525, but in one which merely repeats their substance:&mdash;<quote lang="greek">to\ d' a)mfinei/khton...a)mme/nei</quote>.</p>
<p>Now, to justify such a repetition, it is manifest that (2) and (4) should be separated, not by a mere parenthesis, such as (3) now is, but by some further allusion to <emph>the fight.</emph> This inference is strengthened by the phrase, <quote lang="greek">to\ d' a)mfinei/khton o)/mma nu/mfas</quote>, which gains point if a reference to the <quote lang="greek">nei=kos</quote> has immediately preceded.</p>
<p>I believe that <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">e)gw\</lemma> has come from <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">a)gw\n</lemma>, under the influence of <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">fra/zw</lemma>. The sense of the verse was, &lsquo;And the strife goes on raging, as I describe&rsquo; (referring to vv. 517&mdash;522). <quote lang="greek">*m*a*t*h*r</quote> may well be a corruption of <quote lang="greek">*m*a*r*g*a*i</quote>, a loss of <quote lang="greek">*r</quote> having been followed by a change of <quote lang="greek">*g</quote> to <quote lang="greek">*t</quote>. This may have happened after <quote lang="greek">a)gw\n</quote> had become <quote lang="greek">e)gw\</quote>, with help, perhaps, from a reminiscence of  <bibl n="Soph.

<p> The text of this passage is, I believe, sound, though the diction is bold, and somewhat careless. The <emph>one</emph> <quote lang="greek">h(/bh</quote> (Iol&egrave;'s) is growing to the perfect flower, while the other (Deianeira's) is declining. (Cp.   <bibl n="Aristoph. Lys. 596">Ar. <title>Lys.</title>596</bibl><quote lang="greek">th=s de\ gunaiko\s smikro\s o( kairo/s</quote>.) In what follows, these points may be noted.</p>
<p>(1) <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">w(=n</lemma>, fem., refers to the two phases of <quote lang="greek">h(/bh</quote> just mentioned. The gen. is partitive: &lsquo;of (out of) these <quote lang="greek">h(=bai</quote>, the eye delights in the <quote lang="greek">a)/nqos</quote>.&rsquo; Here <quote lang="greek">a)/nqos</quote> is a shorter way of expressing <quote lang="greek">th\n a)nqou=san</quote>,&mdash;the <quote lang="greek">h(/bh</quote> which is in its early bloom. <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">w(=n</lemma> could not, surely, refer to <quote lang="greek">th\n me\n e(/rpousan pro/sw</quote> <emph>only</emph>, as if it meant <quote lang="greek">tw=n ne/wn gunaikw=n</quote> (schol.): it must refer to <quote lang="greek">th\n de\ fqi/nousan</quote> also. Nor, again, could <quote lang="greek">w)=n</quote> stand for <quote lang="greek">w(=n th=s me/n</quote>.</p>
<p>(2) <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">tw=n d' u(pektre/pei po/da</lemma>. Here <quote lang="greek">tw=n d)</quote> ought in strictness to have been <quote lang="greek">th=s d)</quote>, <emph>sc.</emph> <quote lang="greek">th=s fqinou/shs h(/bhs</quote>. But, in the poet's thought, <quote lang="greek">tw=n d)</quote> means, &lsquo;<emph>the other kind</emph>,&rsquo;&mdash; <foreign lang="la">i.e.</foreign>, the women who represent the <quote lang="greek">fqi/nousa h(/bh</quote>. The subject to <quote lang="greek">u(pektre/pei</quote> is not <quote lang="greek">o)fqalmo/s</quote>, but the <emph>man</emph> implied by it (<quote lang="greek">o( o(rw=n</quote>). The eye, as being here the guide of the choice, might, indeed, be said to &lsquo;turn the foot aside,&rsquo; in the sense of <emph>causing</emph> that movement; but this would be awkward. For the transition of thought from <quote lang="greek">o)fqalmo/s</quote> to the <emph>person</emph>, cp.   <bibl n="Eur.

Clearly, then, <quote lang="greek">luth/rion</quote> is sound: and it must mean, as everywhere else, &lsquo;giving deliverance.&rsquo; The corrupt word is <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">lu/phma</lemma>: it has displaced some word of which <quote lang="greek">luth/rion</quote> could be the epithet. I believe that Sophocles wrote <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">lw/fhma</lemma>, &lsquo;a means of <emph>relief.</emph>&rsquo; Hesychius shows that this noun was not only current, but tolerably familiar; for he has <quote lang="greek">lw=far: lw/fhma</quote>,&mdash;using it to explain the rarer form. The corruption into <quote lang="greek">lu/phma</quote> probably arose through a marginal gloss, <quote lang="greek">lu/phs</quote>, on <quote lang="greek">luth/rion</quote>.</p>
<p>Deianeira is here speaking of an expedient which gives her some hope, indeed, but no assured confidence (590 f.). This exactly suits the usage of <quote lang="greek">lwfa=n</quote> and its derivatives, which denote the <emph>alleviation</emph> of evil,&mdash;not its complete removal. Cp.  <bibl n="Soph. Aj. 61"> <title>Ai.</title>61</bibl><quote lang="greek">e)peidh\ tou=d' e)lw/fhsen po/nou</quote>.  <bibl n="Thuc.  6. 12">Thuc.6. 12</bibl><quote lang="greek">a)po\ no/sou mega/lhs kai\ pole/mou braxu/ ti lelwfh/ka&lt;*&gt;en</quote>.  <cit><bibl n="Plat.

Deianeira, in bethinking her of the philtre, has found that which holds out a promise of deliverance, and <emph>assuages</emph>, though it does not cure, her pain,&mdash;a <quote lang="greek">luth/rion lw/fhma</quote>.</p>
<p>The attempted versions of <quote lang="greek">luth/rion lu/phma</quote> have been these:&mdash;(1) With a comma after <quote lang="greek">th=|d)</quote>: &lsquo;a thing to grieve this girl, for my deliverance&rsquo;:&mdash;a grammatically sound phrase, but wholly unsuited to Deianeira, whose aim is to be <emph>more loved than</emph> Iol&egrave; (584 ff.),&mdash;but not to pain her. (2) Taking <quote lang="greek">luth/rion</quote> as=<quote lang="greek">luto/n</quote>: &lsquo;how I find that my pain is remediable.&rsquo; This is impossible. (3) Governing <quote lang="greek">lu/phma</quote> by <quote lang="greek">luth/rion</quote>: &lsquo;how I have a thing to remedy my pain.&rsquo; Also impossible.</p>
<p>Paley, changing <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">e)/xw</lemma> to <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">e)/xei</lemma>, renders, &lsquo;in what way my grief has <emph>a remedy</emph>&rsquo;&mdash; making <quote lang="greek">luth/rion</quote> a subst. This is clearly untenable. He cites   <bibl n="Pind.

Nor is the case helped by Hesychius, <quote lang="greek">luth/rion: fulakth/rion.&mdash; <emph>th=|d) u(mi=n fra/sw</emph></quote>: the words mean strictly that the story will follow the course&mdash; <foreign lang="la">i.e.</foreign>, will exhibit the line of thought&mdash;by which the remedy has been found.

(1) It is clear that <quote lang="greek">au)th\n</quote> means merely <emph>eam</emph>, not <emph>ipsam.</emph> We cannot distinguish <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ta\ th=s ce/nhs prosde/gmata</lemma>, as meaning the welcome of Iol&egrave; <emph>along with the other captives</emph>, from a special welcome given to Iol&egrave; personally. (2) <quote lang="greek">au)th\n</quote>, although unemphatic, has a position which would usually give emphasis. But this is excused by the fact that the whole clause, <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">au)th\n w(s e)deca/mhn fi/lws</lemma>, depends on <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">oi)=sqa</lemma>, being merely epexegetic of <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ta\ th=s ce/nhs prosde/gmata</lemma> (instead of <quote lang="greek">oi(=a e)ge/neto</quote> or the like). The chief stress falls on <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">fi/lws</lemma>. (3) If, however, we had <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">au)th/n q)</lemma>, then the sentence would lose that compact unity which justifies the place of the pronoun. And so <quote lang="greek">au)th/n q)</quote> would naturally seem to mean <emph>ipsam</emph>,&mdash;raising the objection noticed above (1). The insertion of <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">q)</lemma> may easily have arisen from a notion that the second clause required a link with the first.

<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ta=s peiqou=s pagxri/stw|</lemma> <quote lang="greek">k.t.l.</quote> The corresponding verses of the strophe (653 f.) appear sound: <quote lang="greek">nu=n d' *)/arhs oi)strhqei\s</quote> &verbar; <quote lang="greek">e)ce/lus' e)pi/ponon a(me/ran</quote>. The traditional text here, <quote lang="greek">ta=s peiqou=s pagxri/stw|</quote> &verbar; <quote lang="greek">sugkraqei\s e)pi\ profa/sei qhro/s</quote>, makes a long syllable answer to the second of <quote lang="greek">e)ce/lus)</quote>, and to the second of <quote lang="greek">a(me/ran</quote>.</p>
<p>Let us now examine the text in detail.</p>
<p>(1) <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">pagxri/stw|</lemma> does not look like a gloss. Dindorf, who thinks it one, can only suggest that it arose from <quote lang="greek">pa/gxristos</quote>, a gloss upon <quote lang="greek">sugkraqei/s</quote>. This is hardly probable. Sophocles is fond of intensive compounds with <quote lang="greek">pa=s</quote>: <bibl n="Soph. Trach. 505">cp. 505</bibl>, 652:  <bibl n="Soph. El. 851"> <title>El.</title>851</bibl><quote lang="greek">pansu/rtw|, pammh/nw|</quote>:  <bibl n="Soph. Ant. 1282"> <title>Ant.</title>1282</bibl><quote lang="greek">pammh/twr</quote>: fr. 347 <quote lang="greek">pa/gcenos</quote>, etc. As an epithet for the robe, <quote lang="greek">pagxri/stw|</quote>, &lsquo;thoroughly anointed,&rsquo; is suitable. (Cp. Deianeira's words in 580.) But it cannot be a subst., as the schol. on 663 would make it (<quote lang="greek">lei/pei tw=| pe/plw|</quote>).</p>
<p>(2) The words <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">e)pi\ profa/sei qhro/s</lemma>= <quote lang="greek">e)pi/ponon a(me/ran</quote> in 654. Besides being unmetrical, <quote lang="greek">qhro/s</quote> requires an unexampled sense for <quote lang="greek">profa/sei</quote>, viz., &lsquo;precept.&rsquo; Hence Dindorf reads <quote lang="greek">profa/nsei</quote> (a word which is not extant), and in 654 <quote lang="greek">e)pipo/nwn a(mera=n</quote>. For <quote lang="greek">qhro/s</quote>, M. Haupt conjectured <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">fa/rous</lemma> (<quote lang="greek">*q*h*r*o*s, *f*a*r*o*s</quote>): for the <quote lang="greek">a^</quote>, <bibl n="Soph. Trach. 916">cp. 916</bibl>. The words <quote lang="greek">e)pi\ profa/sei fa/rous</quote> then mean, &lsquo;on the pretext of the robe.&rsquo; The robe was the <quote lang="greek">pro/fasis</quote> for using the love-charm. <quote lang="greek">pagxri/stw|</quote> can be retained in the dat., agreeing with <quote lang="greek">profa/sei</quote> (cp.  <bibl n="Soph. Ant. 794"> <title>Ant.</title>794</bibl> n.).</p>
<p>(3) For <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">sugkraqei\s</lemma>, cp.  <bibl n="Soph. Ant. 1311"> <title>Ant.</title>1311</bibl><quote lang="greek">deilai/a| de\ sugke/kramai du/a|</quote> (&lsquo;steeped in&rsquo; it):  <bibl n="Soph. Aj. 895"> <title>Ai.</title>895</bibl><quote lang="greek">oi)/ktw| tw=|de sugkekrame/nhn</quote> (&lsquo;steeped in this lament,&rsquo;&mdash;<foreign lang="la">i.e.</foreign>, in the anguish of it).  <title>Plut.</title> 853 <quote lang="greek">ou(/tw polufo/rw| sugke/kramai dai/moni</quote>. Thus the primary sense of <emph>mixture</emph>, or <emph>fusion</emph>, led to that of intimate union. If we accept <quote lang="greek">fa/rous</quote>, then <quote lang="greek">sugkraqei\s</quote> would be most naturally taken in the sense which <quote lang="greek">pani/meros</quote>, just before it, could suggest,&mdash; &lsquo;made one in heart&rsquo; with Deianeira.</p>
<p>There remains, however, the metrical discrepancy between <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">sugkraqei\s</lemma> and <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">e)ce/lus)</lemma> in 654. Hermann read <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">e)cei/lus)</lemma> (&lsquo;unrolled,&rsquo; meaning, &lsquo;disentangled,&rsquo; &lsquo;brought to a smooth close&rsquo;). But <quote lang="greek">e)ce/lus)</quote>  seems genuine. It is possible, however, that <quote lang="greek">sugkraqei\s</quote> was an explanation of <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">suntakei\s</lemma> (suggested by Paley), which would give the same sense. Cp.   <bibl n="Aesch. Supp. 1029">Aesch. <title>Suppl.</title>1029</bibl><quote lang="greek">game/tas</quote> &verbar; <quote lang="greek">sunthxqei\s au)/rais a)do/lois</quote> &verbar; <quote lang="greek">gennai/as a)lo/xw| yuxa=s</quote>, &lsquo;husband <emph>made one with</emph> wife in the sincere spirit of a loyal soul.&rsquo; So <quote lang="greek">suntakei/s tini</quote>, of close attachment,   <bibl n="Plat. Sym. 183E">Plat. <title>Symp.</title> 183E</bibl><bibl n="Plat. Sym. 192">Plat. Symp., 192</bibl></p>
<p>Either <quote lang="greek">sugkraqei/s</quote> or <quote lang="greek">suntakei/s</quote> would here admit a secondary sense, unconsciously prophetic of the dire event (833 <quote lang="greek">prostake/ntos i)ou=</quote>: 836 <quote lang="greek">prostetakw/s</quote>),&mdash; like <quote lang="greek">prosarmo/sai</quote> in 494.&mdash;For other views, see Appendix.

So Pindar distinguishes him as <quote lang="greek">*kroni/dan</quote> &verbar; <quote lang="greek">*ke/ntauron</quote> (<title>N.</title> 3. 47), <quote lang="greek">ou)rani/da go/non eu)rume/donta *kro/nou</quote> (<title>P.</title> 3. 4): and Apollonius Rhodius as <quote lang="greek">a)/lla me\n i(/ppw|</quote>, &verbar; <quote lang="greek">a)/lla qew=| a)ta/lanton</quote> (2. 1240). He was still more separated from the rest of the Centaur tribe by his just and gentle character ( <bibl n="Hom. Il. 11.832"> <title>Il.</title>11. 832</bibl><quote lang="greek">dikaio/tatos *kentau/rwn</quote>). Hence Greek art, after the in vention of the hippo-centaur (564 n.), continued to portray Cheiron under the more humane type of the andro-centaur. This is his form on Greek vases, down at least to 400 B.C. Later art neglected this distinction. (See  Colvin S. in <title>Journ. Hellen. Stud.</title>, vol. 1. pp. 133&mdash; 137.)</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">phmh/nanta</lemma>. Other Centaurs, routed by Heracles in Arcadia, fled to Cheiron near Cape Malea; and the hero, in shooting at them, accidentally wounded his friend. Cheiron could not be healed; and, being a god, could not die. At last Zeus allowed him to exchange fates, the immortal for the mortal, with Prometheus; and so he found rest ( <bibl n="Apollod. 2.5.4">Apollod.2. 5. 4</bibl>).</p>
<p>Ovid varies the story. Heracles visited Cheiron on Mount Pelion; a poisoned arrow chanced to fall from the hero's quiver on the left foot of the Centaur. <cit><quote lang="la">Virus edax superabat opem...Nona dies aderat, cum tu, iustissime Chiron, &verbar; Bis septem stellis corpore cinctus eras.</quote> <bibl n="Ov.

(2) The next act would be to sprinkle the <quote lang="greek">xe/rniy</quote> on the sacrificers; who would then take barleymeal (<quote lang="greek">ou)loxu/tai</quote>) in the hands from the basket, <quote lang="greek">kanou=n</quote>. (3) Then Heracles offers his prayer to Zeus. (4) The actual immolation follows; the barley-meal is sprinkled on the heads of victims; hair, cut from one or more of them, is thrown on the altar-fire; and they are slain. (5) The <quote lang="greek">mhri/a</quote> ( <bibl n="Soph. Ant. 1011"> <title>Ant.</title>1011</bibl>), doubly wrapped in fat, are burnt on the altar.

<p>Several critics alter <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">kathu/xeto</lemma> to <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">kath/rxeto</lemma>.

<p>But <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">kathu/xeto</lemma> is an immeasurably finer reading.

Athenaeus (66 A) quotes vv. 781 f., as cited by Apollodorus (<emph>c.</emph> 140 B.C.), without variation from our text. The reading, then, is at least a very old one.

<p>This is the only passage of the play which mentions the period of twelve years. In 44 f. and 164 f., the reference is merely to the fifteen months which, when Heracles left home, were still wanting to those twelve years. It may be asked, then, whence the Chorus derive their knowledge of the twelve years; for Deianeira, in 155 ff., speaks as if they had not then heard of the oracle. The answer is simply that this inconsistency of detail was overlooked by the poet; the term of twelve years was in his mind, as a familiar part of the story; and he forgot that, if the Chorus were to know it, Deianeira ought to have mentioned it.</p>
<p>Needless difficulties have been made  by assuming that the allusion here must be to the fifteen months of 44 f. and 164 f. Even then, however, it has to be supposed that &lsquo;twelve months&rsquo; are put loosely for &lsquo;fifteen.&rsquo;</p>

<div3 id="cl839" type="commLine" n="839">
<p>It has long been the general belief that the words <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ne/sou</lemma> (or <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ne/ssou</lemma>) <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">q' u(/po</lemma>, found in the MSS., have arisen from a gloss,&mdash;the name of Nessus having been introduced to explain <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">melagxai/ta</lemma>. But otherwise there has been little agreement. The views of various critics are given in the Appendix.</p>
<p>Here I may briefly state my own conclusions. (1) <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">melagxai/ta</lemma>, &lsquo;the blackhaired one,&rsquo; could probably stand without a substantive, or proper name,&mdash;esp. as <quote lang="greek">*kentau/rou</quote> has occurred not far back; though it would be somewhat harsh.</p>
<p>(2) Comparing v. 830 with v. 840, we see that the words <quote lang="greek">e)/xoi qanw\n latrei/an</quote> in 830 correspond metrically with <quote lang="greek">-a^ ke/ntr' e)pize/santa</quote>. The words <quote lang="greek">e)/ti pot' e)/t' e)pi/ponon</quote> in 830 ought therefore to correspond with what stands between <quote lang="greek">ai)ki/zei</quote> in 839 and the <quote lang="greek">a^</quote> before <quote lang="greek">ke/ntr)</quote> in 840: viz., acc. to the MSS., <quote lang="greek">ne/sou</quote> (or <quote lang="greek">ne/ssou</quote>) <quote lang="greek">q' u(/po foi/nia dolo/muq-</quote>.</p>
<p>(3) Now, if <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">ne/sou q' u(/po</lemma> were ejected, this correspondence would be obtained by reading <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">u(po/fona</lemma> (instead of <quote lang="greek">foi/nia</quote>) <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">dolo/muqa</lemma>. The form <quote lang="greek">u(po/fonos</quote>, though not extant, is correct (cp. <quote lang="greek">a)po/fonos</quote> in   <bibl n="Eur. Orest. 163">Eur. <title>Or.</title>163</bibl><bibl n="Eur. Orest. 192">Eur. Or., 192</bibl>). The <quote lang="greek">ke/ntra</quote> would be <quote lang="greek">u(po/fona</quote> as being &lsquo;secretly fraught with death.&rsquo; The hiatus in <quote lang="greek">ai)ki/zei</quote> &verbar; <quote lang="greek">u(po/fona</quote> is not unexampled, though it has not the usual excuse of a slight pause: <bibl n="Soph. Trach. 833">cp. 833</bibl> f., 846 f.;  <bibl n="Soph. Phil. 832"> <title>Ph.</title>832</bibl> n. Such a hiatus has been assumed here by Hermann and others. It might be avoided, however, by reading <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">fo/nia dolio/muqa</lemma>. The forms <quote lang="greek">dolo/muqos</quote> and <quote lang="greek">dolio/muqos</quote> are equally correct: cp. <quote lang="greek">dolo/mhtis</quote> and <quote lang="greek">dolio/mhtis, dolo/frwn</quote> and <quote lang="greek">dolio/frwn</quote>. In this case, the origin of <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">u(/po</lemma> would remain obscure.</p>
<p>(4) But a closer adherence to the MS. text becomes possible, if, with Gleditsch, we read <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">*ne/ssou u(pofo/nia dolio/muqa ke/ntr' e)pize/santa</lemma>, and in 830 <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">e)/ti pot' e)/t' e)pi/ponon &lt;po/nwn&gt; e)/xoi qanw\n latrei/an</lemma>. The form <quote lang="greek">u(pofo/nios</quote> occurs in the neut. pl. <quote lang="greek">u(pofo/nia</quote>, as a subst., meaning the <quote lang="greek">poinh/</quote> paid to the kinsfolk of a slain man (Harpocr.). The great recommendation of this reading is that it fully accounts for the traditional text here,&mdash; the insertion in the MSS. of <quote lang="greek">q)</quote> before <quote lang="greek">u(/po</quote> being a trivial error of a common type; while in 830 <quote lang="greek">po/nwn</quote> might easily have dropped out after <quote lang="greek">e)pi/ponon</quote>.

<p>The doubt as to the reading here is confined to the words between <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">po/poi</lemma> and <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">e)pe/mole</lemma>. The traditional text is, <quote lang="greek">oi(=on a)narsi/wn</quote> &verbar; <quote lang="greek">ou)/pw a)gakleito\n *(hrakle/ous</quote>. The <emph>v. l.</emph> <quote lang="greek">*(hrakle/a</quote>, found in a few of the later MSS., was apparently prompted by <quote lang="greek">a)gakleito/n</quote>. In the corresponding vv. of the strophe (841 ff.), the MS. text is, <quote lang="greek">mega/lan prosorw=sa do/mois bla/ban</quote> &verbar; <quote lang="greek">ne/wn a)i+sso/ntwn ga/mwn, ta\ me\n ou)/ ti</quote>: where the only doubt affecting metre is between <quote lang="greek">do/mois</quote> and <quote lang="greek">do/moisi</quote>.</p>
<p>It seems almost certain that <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">*(hrakle/ous</lemma> was a gloss, and that <quote lang="greek">ta\ me\n ou)/ ti</quote> in the strophe answered metrically to <quote lang="greek">a)gakleito/n</quote> here. The proposed emendations of this passage are classified in the Appendix. Those which eject <quote lang="greek">*(hrakle/ous</quote> follow one of two methods. (1) To read <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">do/mois</lemma>, not <quote lang="greek">do/moisi</quote>, in 842: to insert a long syllable, beginning with a vowel (as <quote lang="greek">e)c</quote>), before <quote lang="greek">a)narsi/wn</quote>: and to supply something, equal to <quote lang="greek">&breve;&macr;</quote> (as <quote lang="greek">pot' a)/ndr)</quote>), between <quote lang="greek">ou)/pw</quote> and <quote lang="greek">a)gakleito/n</quote>. (2) To read <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">do/moisi</lemma> in 842: and to make such an addition to <quote lang="greek">ou)/pw</quote> as shall metrically balance <quote lang="greek">a)i+sso/ntwn ga/mwn</quote>. On this plan, I suggest <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">&lt;u(/p)&gt; ou)/pw &lt;tou=de sw=m)&gt; a)gakleito/n</lemma>. The prep. goes with <quote lang="greek">a)narsi/wn</quote>, which, without a prep., would here be somewhat harsh (as=&lsquo;from his foes&rsquo;). <quote lang="greek">*(hrakle/ous</quote> would have been a gloss on <quote lang="greek">to&lt;*&gt;e</quote>.

<p>The motive of the whole passage from 863 to 898 is the dramatic necessity of making an impressive preparation for the Nurse's <quote lang="greek">r(h=sis</quote>. It rests with the Chorus alone to do this, since no actor is present.</p>

<p>The genuine verse must have had some direct reference to the context. She is weeping at the sight of attached servants whom she is about to leave. The general sense ought to be, &lsquo;bewailing her own fate, and that of the household over which a change was impending&rsquo;; since, when master and mistress were dead, the household would be dissolved, and the faithful slaves would pass into other hands. After the death of Heracles, Ce&yuml;x, the king of Trachis (40 n.), was deterred by Eurystheus from continuing to protect the Heracleidae; who sought refuge at Athens.

<p> Exodos. Heracles bewails his doom, and gives his last commands to his son.&mdash;Anapaests, which mark the entrance of the mournful procession, are succeeded by lyrics <quote lang="greek">a)po\ skhnh=s</quote>, in the  nature of a <quote lang="greek">kommo/s</quote> (1004&mdash;1043). Iambic dialogue follows, down to 1258; and anapaests then close the play.</p>
<p>Hyllus, detained by the events within (928), cannot have been far on his way towards the harbour (902) when he met the sufferer.

<p><emph>971 f.</emph> The traditional text, <quote lang="greek">oi)/moi e)gw\ sou=</quote>, &verbar; <quote lang="greek">pa/ter, oi)/moi e)gw\ sou= me/leos</quote>, gives an anapaestic monometer, followed by an anapaestic dimeter in which the third foot lacks a syllable. The first four words, <quote lang="greek">oi)/moi e)gw\ sou=, pa/ter</quote>, are clearly sound. As regards the rest, the choice is between two remedies. (1) To omit the second <quote lang="greek">oi)/moi e)gw\ sou=</quote>, and substitute <quote lang="greek">w)=</quote>, as Dindorf does. Verses 971 f. then shrink into one anapaestic dimeter. (2) To supply the defect in 972 by substituting an anapaest, or its equivalent, for the second <quote lang="greek">sou=</quote>. Thus we might write <quote lang="greek">pa/ter, oi)/moi e)gw/, &lt;pa/ter, w)\&gt; me/leos</quote>. I incline to this second course, because the monometer in 971 <quote lang="greek">oi)/moi e)gw\ sou=</quote> seems right as a prelude.

<p> This passage consists of lyrics delivered by actors (<quote lang="greek">a)po\ skhnh=s</quote>). As the Chorus takes no part in it, it is not technically a <quote lang="greek">kommo/s</quote>, which is a <quote lang="greek">qrh=nos koino\s xorou= kai\ a)po\ skhnh=s</quote>.</p>
<p>The lyric structure is complex, but not obscure. The passage falls into two main parts, separated by the five hexameters in 1018&mdash;1022 (<quote lang="greek">w)= pai= tou=d' a)ndro\s...ne/mei *zeu/s</quote>). I. The first part consists of 1004&mdash;1017, in which the first three verses correspond metrically with the last three. II. The second part consists of 1023&mdash;1043. (It is equal in length with the first part, though the traditional numbering makes it appear longer.) Here, the first four verses correspond with the last four. Then the central portion of part I. corresponds with the central portion of part II. Thus: (1) 1st strophe, 1004&mdash;1006,=1st antistr., 1015&mdash;1017. (2) 2nd str., 1007&mdash;1009,=2nd antistr., 1027&mdash;1030. (3) 3rd str., 1023&mdash;1026, =3rd antistr., 1040&mdash;1043. The dactyls in 1010&mdash;1014, and 1031&mdash;1040, could also be regarded as forming a fourth strophe and antistrophe.&mdash;For the metres see Metrical Analysis.

(1) The corresponding verses of the antistrophe (1016 f.) may be taken as showing the true metre. (2) L's variant for <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">eu)na=sai</lemma> in 1005, viz. <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">u(/staton</lemma>, may therefore be received. <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">eu)na/sai</lemma> (<quote lang="greek">a^</quote>), from <quote lang="greek">eu)na/zw</quote> is impossible, since, like <quote lang="greek">eu)na=sai</quote> (<quote lang="greek">eu)na/w</quote>), it could only be transitive. (3) In 1006 the MS. <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">du/stanon</lemma> is clearly wrong; it may have been either a gloss on <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">du/smoron</lemma>, or a corruption of <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">u(/staton</lemma>. (4) Hermann's reading in 1006, <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">e)a=q' u(/staton eu)na=sqai</lemma>, is strongly confirmed by the metrical correspondence with 1017, <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">molw\n tou= stugerou=; feu= feu=</lemma>,&mdash;a verse of undoubted soundness.

<p>Cicero's version is essentially that of an orator; the true test for it would be declamation. But even a reader can feel its sonorous vigour, and its Roman gravity; Cicero succeeds as Lord Derby succeeded in much of the <title>Iliad.</title> The rendering of the Greek is very free, sometimes inadequate, but always manly, and highly terse; indeed, the 57 lines of the original become 45; in one place, eleven verses (1079&mdash;1089) are reduced to four (vv. 30&mdash;33).</p>

Here <quote lang="greek">qerma\</quote> is not &lsquo;rash,&rsquo; but expresses intense conflict with deadly peril; as we speak of &lsquo;a hot fight.&rsquo;</p>
<p><lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">kou) lo/gw| kaka\</lemma> fitly follows <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">qerma/</lemma>, the word which recalls the moment of dire stress. His trials had been fiery, and grievous, not in report or name alone.  No <quote lang="greek">lo/gos</quote> could express to others what the <quote lang="greek">e)/rga</quote> had been to the doer. In  <bibl n="Soph.

<p>The MS. reading, <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">kai\ lo/gw| kaka\</lemma>, is certainly wrong, for two reasons. (1) When the required sense is, &lsquo;grievous to tell,&rsquo; <quote lang="greek">kaka/</quote> becomes, for Greek poetical idiom, too weak; we need such a word as <quote lang="greek">deina/</quote> or <quote lang="greek">a)lgeina/</quote>. This objection does not apply to a phrase of ironical form, such as <quote lang="greek">ou) lo/gw| kaka/</quote>. (2) Idiom would require <quote lang="greek">kai\ le/gein</quote> rather than <quote lang="greek">kai\ lo/gw|</quote>. Cicero, no doubt, read <quote lang="greek">kai\ lo/gw|</quote> (&lsquo;<title>O multa</title> dictu gravia, <emph>perpessu aspera</emph>&rsquo;); but that proves nothing. In  <bibl n="Soph.

Amphitryon accidentally killed his uncle, Electryon, and then fled from Tiryns to Thebes with his betrothed. At Thebes Alcmena bore Heracles to Zeus.

He  afterwards slew Iphitus, and then sought a refuge for his household at Trachis (39). But, in the course of the fifteen months since he departed for Lydia, Alcmena had returned to Tiryns, (Eurystheus having no cause to fear the aged widow,)&mdash;and had taken some of her grandchildren with her, in order to lighten the burden on the hospitality of Ce&yuml;x.&mdash; <lemma lang="greek" targOrder="U">cullabou=s)</lemma>, here simply=<quote lang="greek">labou=sa meq' e(auth=s</quote>: cp.  <bibl n="Soph.

<p>The name <quote lang="greek">*selloi/</quote>, or <quote lang="greek">*(elloi/</quote> (akin to <quote lang="greek">*(/ellhn, *(ella/s</quote>), denoted a prehistoric tribe, dwelling at and around Dodona: see Appendix, &sect; 4.

<p>Iol&egrave; figured in legend as the wife of Hyllus. Their son, <quote lang="greek">*kleodai=os</quote> (called <quote lang="greek">*kleoda/ths</quote> by Theopompus, fr. 30), was mentioned by Hesiod (schol. <bibl n="Apollon. 1.824">Ap.

Hyllus and Iol&egrave; had also a daughter, <quote lang="greek">*eu)ai/xmh</quote>, known in Messenian story ( <bibl n="Paus. 4. 2. 1">Paus.4. 2. 1</bibl>).</p>
<p>But, in this play, Iol&egrave; is the paramour of Heracles, and indirectly the cause of his death. How, then, could Hyllus wed her? His own words (1233&mdash;1237) express what a Greek would feel. It was necessary, then, that the marriage should be imposed upon him by his dying father's inexorable command.</p>

<p> The unanimous tradition assigned verses 1264&mdash;1274 to Hyllus. Verses 1275&mdash;1278 were given by some to the Chorus, and by others to Hyllus. From the indication in L at v. 1275 (<quote lang="greek">xoro\s gra/fetai u(/llos</quote>), and from the schol. there (<quote lang="greek">xoro/s: tine\s u(/llos</quote>), it may be conjectured that the attribution of 1275&mdash;1278 to the Chorus was the prevalent one. This was only natural, as the Chorus usually closes the play. A majority of modern editors, however, give vv. 1264&mdash;1278 wholly to Hyllus; and they seem right.&mdash;See Appendix.

<p> These four verses are addressed by Hyllus to the leader of the Chorus, and give the signal for moving from the orchestra.
