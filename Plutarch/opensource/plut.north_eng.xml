                  <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">The Family of the Martians.</note>The house of the Martians at Rome was of the number
of the Patricians, out of the which have sprung many noble personages,
whereof Ancus Martius was one, King Numa's daughter's
son, who was King of Rome after Tullus Hostilius. 
<note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Publius and Quintius Martius brought the water by conduits to Rome.</note> 
Of
the same house were Publius and Quintus, who brought to Rome
their best water they had, by conduits. Censorinus also came
of that family, that was so surnamed, because the people had
chosen him Censor twice. 
<note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Censorinus' law.</note>Through whose persuasion they made
a law, that no man from thenceforth might 
<term>require</term>

or enjoy
the Censorship twice. Caius Martius, whose life we intend now
to write, being left an orphan by his father, was brought up
under his mother a widow; who taught us by experience, that
orphanage bringeth many 
<term>discommodities</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">disadvantages.</note>

<pb n="2"/>
not hinder him to become an honest man, and to excel in virtue
above the common sort: as they that are meanly born wrongfully
do complain, that it is the occasion of their casting away,
for that no man in their youth taketh any care of them to see
them well brought up, and taught that were 
<term>meet</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">whatever is fitting.</note>. This man
also is a good proof to confirm some men's opinions: That a
rare and excellent wit, untaught, cloth bring forth many good and
evil things together: as a fat soil that lieth unmanured bringeth
forth both herbs and weeds. For this Martius' natural
wit and great heart did marvellously stir up his courage to do
and attempt notable acts. But on the other side, for lack of
education, he was so choleric and impatient, that he would
yield to no living creature: which made him churlish, uncivil,
and altogether unfit for any man's 
<term>conversation</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">company</note>. Yet men marvelling
much at his constancy, that he was never overcome

thereupon they well liked and
commended his stoutness and

                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">moderation</note>
But for all that
they could not be acquainted with him, as one citizen useth to
be with another in the city: his behaviour was so unpleasant
to them by reason of a certain insolent and stern manner he
had, which, because he was too lordly, was disliked. <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">The benefit of learning.</note>And to
say truly, the greatest benefit that learning bringeth unto men

<milestone n="2" unit="para"/>But Martius
being more inclined to the wars than any other gentleman
of his time, began from his childhood to give himself to
handle weapons, and daily did exercise himself therein: and he
esteemed outward armour to no purpose, unless one were
naturally armed within. Moreover he did so exercise his body
to

was when Tarquin surnamed the proud (that had been king of
Rome, and was driven out for his pride, after many attempts
made by sundry battles to come in again, wherein he was ever
overcome) did come to Rome with all the aid of the Latins,
and many other people of Italy: even as it were

upon a battle by them, who with a great and mighty
army had undertaken to put him into his kingdom again, not
so much to pleasure him, as to overthrow the power of the
Romans, whose greatness they both feared and envied. In
this battle, wherein were many hot and sharp encounters of
either 
<term>party</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">on both sides.</note>,
Martius valiantly fought in the sight of the Dictator:

hard 
<term>by</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">quite close beside.</note>

with his own hands, that had before overthrown the Roman.
<note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Coriolanus crowned with a garland of oaken boughs.</note>Hereupon, after the battle was won, the Dictator did not forget
so noble an act, and therefore first of all he crowned Martius
with a garland of oaken boughs. For whosoever saveth the life
of a Roman, it is a 
<term>manner</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">custom.</note>
among them, to honour him with
such a garland. This was, either because the law did this
honour to the oak, in favour of the Arcadians, who by the oracle
of Apollo were in old time called eaters of acorns: or else because
the soldiers might easily in every place come 
<term>by</term>

oaken
boughs: or lastly, because they thought it very necessary, to
give him that had saved a citizen's life, a crown of this tree to
honour him, being properly dedicated unto Jupiter, the patron
and protector of cities, and thought amongst other wild trees to
bring forth a profitable fruit, and of plants to be the strongest.
<note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">The goodness of the oak.</note>Moreover, men at the first beginning did use acorns for their
bread, and honey for their drink: and further, the oak did feed
their beasts, and give them birds, by taking glue from the oaks,
with the which they made bird-lime to catch silly birds. They
say that Castor and Pollux appeared in this battle, and that

                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">immediately</note>
after the battle, men saw them in the marketplace
at Rome, all their horses being on a white foam: and
they were the first that brought news of the victory, even in the
same place where remaineth at this present a temple built in
the honour of them, near unto the fountain. And this is the
cause why the day of this victory (which was the fifteenth of
July) is consecrated yet to this day unto Castor and Pollux.

but touching Martius, the only thing that made him to love
honour was the joy he saw his mother did take of him. For
he thought nothing made him so happy and honourable, as that
his mother might hear every body praise and commend him,

venture himself to follow the flying enemies into their city, for
that it was full of men of war very well armed and appointed,

afar off. Then they all began to call upon the Consul to
march forward, and to delay no longer, but to give charge upon
the enemy. Martius asked him how the order of their enemy's
battle was, and on which side they had placed their best fighting
men. The Consul made him answer, that he thought the

family they came of. The third was some addition given, either
for some act or notable service, or for some mark on their face,
or of some shape of their body, or else for some special virtue
they had. Even so did the Grecians in old time give

to princes, by reason of some notable act

memory. As
when they have called some Soter and Callinicos, as much to
say as saviour and conqueror. Or else of some notable apparent
mark on one's face, or on his body, they have called him
Phiscon and Grypos: as ye would say, gore<term>belly</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">fat-paunch.</note>,
and hooknosed;
or else for some virtue, as Euergetes and Philadelphes,
to wit, a benefactor, and lover of his brethren. Orotherwise for
one's great felicity, as Eudaemon: as much to say as fortunate.
For so was the second of the

                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">These were the princes that built the city of Cyrene.</note>

of a sore he had in his forehead. One other of his own
family was called Celer, the quick-fly, because a few days after

fencers at

shortness of time. Other had their surnames derived of some
accident at their birth. As to this day they call him Proculeius,
that is born, his father being in some far voyage: and him
Posthumius, that is born after the death of his father. And
<pb n="12"/>


when of two brethren twins, the one cloth die, and the other
surviveth, they call the survivor Vopiscus. Sometime also
they give surnames derived of some mark or misfortune of the
body: as Sylla, to say, crook-nosed: Niger, black: Rufus, red:
Caecus, blind: Claudus, lame. They did wisely in this thing to
accustom men to think, that neither the loss of their sight, nor
other such misfortunes as may chance to men, are any shame
or disgrace unto them; but the manner was to answer boldly to
such names, as if they were called by their proper names.
Howbeit these matters would be better amplified in other stories
than this.

<milestone n="9" ed="Skeat" unit="chapter"/> Martius then, who was now grown to great credit, and a

<milestone n="14" unit="para"/>Shortly after this, Martius stood for the Consulship: and the
common people favoured his suit, thinking it would be a shame
to them to deny and refuse the chiefest noble man of blood,
and most worthy person of Rome, and specially him that had
done so great service and good to the commonwealth. <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">The manner of suing at Rome.</note>For the

a poor gown on their backs, and without any coat underneath,
to pray the citizens to remember them at the day of

testimonies of their valiantness. <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Officers given then by desert, without favour or corruption.</note>Now it is not to be thought
that the suitors went thus loose in a simple gown in the marketplace,
without any coat under it, for fear and suspicion of the

given by favour or corruption. It was but of late time, and long
after this, that buying and selling

                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">took place.</note>
in election of officers,
and that the voices of the electors were bought for money. But
after corruption had once gotten way into the election of offices,
it hath run from man to man, even to the very sentence of

<term>that only</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">that alone.</note>
fumed commonwealths into kingdoms, by making

                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">was right.</note>

that said:<note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Banquets and money given, only destroyers of commonwealths.</note> "he that first made banquets and gave money to the

continuing a long

<milestone n="15" unit="para"/>Now Martius, following this custom, shewed many wounds and
cuts upon his body, which he had received in seventeen years'

foremost man that did set out

                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">advance</note>
to fight. So that there was
not a man among the people but was ashamed of himself, to
refuse so valiant a man: and one of them said to another, "we
must needs choose him Consul, there is no remedy." But when
the day of election was come, and that Martius came to the
market-place with great pomp, accompanied with all the Senate
and the whole Nobility of the city about him, who sought to
make him Consul with the greatest

and intreaty they
could, or ever attempted for any man or matter: then the love
and goodwill of the common people turned straight to an hate
and envy toward him, fearing to put this office of sovereign authority
into his hands, being a man somewhat partial towards
the Nobility, and of great credit and authority amongst the
Patricians, and as one they might 
<term>doubt</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">fear.</note>
would take away altogether
the liberty from the people. Whereupon, for these considerations,
they refused Martius in the end, and made two
other that were suitors, Consuls. The Senate, being marvellously
offended with the people, did account the shame of this
refusal rather to redound to themselves than to Martius but
Martius took it in far worse part than the Senate, and was out
of all patience. For he was a man too full of passion and
choler, and too much given over to self-will and 
<term>opinion</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">self-opinion.</note>,
as one
of a high mind and great courage, that lacked the gravity and

which only is to be

it were a great folly for us, methinks, to do it: yea, shall
I say more? we should, if we were wise, take from them their 
Tribuneship, which most manifestly is the embasing of the 
Consulship, and the cause of the division of the city. The
state whereof, as it standeth, is not now as it was wont to be,
but becometh dismembered in two factions, which maintains
always civil dissension and discord between us, and will never
suffer us again to be united into one body."

these officers that came to arrest him. Then the Tribunes in
their own persons, accompanied with the Aediles, went to fetch
him by force, and so laid violent hands upon him. Howbeit the

and laid sore upon the Aediles: so for that
time the night parted them, and the tumult appeased. The
next morning betimes, the Consuls seeing the people in an uproar,
running to the market-place out of all parts of the city,
they were afraid lest all the city 
<term>would</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">would come.</note>
together by the ears:
wherefore assembling the Senate in all haste, they declared how

                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">concerned them.</note>,
to appease the fury of the people with some
gentle words or grateful decrees in their favour: and moreover,
like wise men they should consider, it was now no time to stand
at defence and in contention, nor yet to fight for honour against
the commonalty, they being fallen to so great an extremity, and
offering such imminent danger. Wherefore they were to consider
temperately of things, and to deliver some present and
gentle pacification. The most part of the Senators that were
present at this council, thought this opinion best, and gave
their consents unto it. Whereupon the Consuls rising out of
council, went to speak unto the people as gently as they could,
and they did pacify their fury and anger,

said: " Forasmuch as the Senate yielded unto reason, the people

the Senate to
change the present state of the commonweal, and to take the
sovereign authority out of the people's hands? Next, when he
was sent for by authority of their officers, why he did contemptuously
resist and disobey? Lastly, seeing he had driven and
beaten the Aediles into the market-place before all the world: if,
in doing this, he had not done as much as in him lay, to raise
civil wars, and to set one citizen against another?" All this was
<pb n="19"/>
spoken to one of these two ends, either that Martius, against his
nature, should be constrained to humble himself and to abase
his haughty and fierce mind: or else, if he continued still in his

<term>stoutness</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">boldness.</note>,
he should incur the people's displeasure and ill-will
so far, that he should never possibly win them again. Which
they hoped would rather

                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">turn out.</note>
so, than otherwise: as indeed
they guessed unhappily, considering Martius' nature and disposition.


<milestone n="11" ed="Skeat" unit="chapter"/> So Martius came and presented himself to answer their
accusations against him, and the people held their peace, and
gave attentive ear, to hear what he would say. <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Coriolanus' stoutness in defense of himself.</note>But where they

                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">make clear.</note>

gave himself in his words to thunder, and look therewithal so
grimly, as though he made no reckoning of the matter. This

the Aediles to apprehend him, and carry him straight

among themselves, and
some of them, holding up their hands to the people, besought

                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">confusion.</note>

was so great, until such time as the Tribunes' own friends and

                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">impossibility.</note>
to convey
Martius to execution without great slaughter and murder of the
nobility, did persuade and advise not to proceed in so violent
and extraordinary a sort, as to put such a man to death without
lawful process in law, but that they should refer the sentence of
his death to the free voice of the people. Then Sicinius, bethinking
<pb n="20"/>
himself a little, did ask the Patricians, for what cause
they took Martius out of the officers' hands that went to do execution? 
The Patricians asked him again, why they would of
themselves so cruelly and wickedly put to death so noble and
valiant a Roman as Martius was, and that without law and justice? 
"Well then," said Sicinius, "if that be the matter, let there
be no quarrel or dissension against the people: for they do
grant your demand, that his cause shall be heard according to
the law. <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Coriolanus hath day given him to answer the people.</note>Therefore," said he to Martius, "we do

and charge
you to appear before the people, the third day of our next sitting

ever as an heavy enemy to the people)
did avow and protest, that they would utterly abase the authority
of the Senate, and destroy the commonweal, if they would
suffer the common people to have authority by voices to give
judgment against the Nobility. On the other side again, the
most ancient Senators, and such as were given to favour the
common people, said: " that when the people should see they had
authority of life and death in their hands, they would not be so
cruel and fierce, but gentle and

                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">courteous.</note>.
More also, that it was not
for contempt of Nobility or the Senate that they sought to have
the authority of justice in their hands, as a pre-eminence and

should be contemned and hated of the Nobility. So

partly for the love and goodwill the nobility did bear
him, and partly for the fear they stood in of the people: asked

                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">on that count.</note>

in any case (whatsoever

their voices by Tribes, and not by hundreds: for by this means
the multitude of the poor needy people (and all such rabble as
had nothing to lose, and had less regard of honesty before their

) than the noble honest citizens, whose

                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">endeavored.</note>

unto the common people, and persuading also to take the office
of Tribuneship from them. And for the third, they charged
him anew, that he had not made the common distribution of
the spoil he had gotten in the invading the territories of the
Antiates: but had of his own authority divided it among them
who were with him in that journey. But this matter was most
strange of all to Martius,

least to have been

with that as with any matter of offence. Whereupon being
burdened on the sudden, and having no ready excuse to make
even at that instant: he began to fall a praising of the soldiers
that had served with him in that journey. But those that were
not with him, being the greater number, cried out so loud, and
made such a noise, that he could not be heard. <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Coriolanus banished forever.</note>To conclude,

desire of revenge, that he had no sense nor feeling of the hard
state he was in: which the common people judge not to be sorrow,
although indeed it be the very same. For when sorrow (as
you would say) is set on fire, then it is converted into spite and
malice, and driveth away for that time all faintness of heart and
natural fear. And this is the cause why the choleric man is so
altered and mad in his actions, as a man set on fire with a
burning ague: for when a man's heart is troubled within, his

it appeared true soon after by his doings.
For when he was come home to his house again, and had taken
his leave of his mother and wife, finding them weeping and
shrieking out for sorrow, and had also comforted and persuaded
them to be content with his chance: he went immediately to
the gate of the city, accompanied with a great number of Patricians,
that brought him thither, from whence he went on his
way with three or four of his friends only, taking nothing with
him, nor requesting anything of any man. So he remained a
few days in the country at his houses,

no way to take a
profitable or honourable course, but only was pricked forward
still to be revenged of the Romans: he thought to raise up
some great wars against them, by their nearest neighbours.
Whereupon he thought it his best way, first to stir up the Volsces
against them, knowing they were yet able enough in
strength and riches to encounter them, notwithstanding their
former losses they had received not long before, and that their
power was not so much impaired, as their malice and desire 
was increased to be revenged of the Romans.

                  <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Tullus Aufidius, a great person among the Volsces.</note> Now in the city 
of Antium there was one called Tullus Aufidius, who for his 
riches, as also for his nobility and valiantness, was honoured 
among the Volsces as a king. Martius knew very well that
Tullus did more 
<term>malice</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">hate.</note>
and envy him than he did all the Romans 
besides: because that many times, in battles where they 
met, they were ever at the encounter one against another, like
lusty courageous youths striving in all emulation of honour, and 
had encountered many times together. Insomuch as, besides
the common quarrel between them, there was bred a marvellous 
private hate one against another. Yet notwithstanding, considering
that Tullus Aufidius was a man of a great mind, and
that he above all other of the Volsces most desired revenge of
the Romans, for the injuries they had done unto them: he did 
an act that confirmed the words of an ancient poet to be true,
who said:
<quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>It is a thing full hard, man's anger to withstand,</l>
                     <l>If it be stiffly bent to take an enterprise in hand.</l>
                     <l>For then most men will have the thing that they desire,</l>

                  </quote>

And so did he. For he disguised himself in such array and
attire, as he thought no man could ever have known him for the
person he was, seeing him in that apparel he had upon his
back: and as Homer said of Ulysses:

<quote rend="blockquote">

good memory and witness of the malice and displeasure thou
shouldest bear me. Indeed the name only remaineth with
me: for the rest the envy and cruelty of the people of Rome
have taken from me, by the sufferance of the dastardly nobility
and magistrates, who have forsaken me, and let me be
banished by the people. This extremity hath now driven me
to come as a poor suitor, to take thy chimney-hearth, not of
any hope I have to save my life thereby for if I had feared
death, I would not have come hither to have put myself in

said unto him: " Stand up, O Martius, and be of good cheer, for
in proffering thyself unto us thou doest us great honour: and
by this means thou mayest hope also of greater things at all the

him in the honourablest manner he could, talking with
him of no other matter at that present: but within few days
after they fell to consultation together, in what sort they should
begin their wars.

                  <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Great Dissension at Rome about Martius' banishment.</note> Now on the other side, the city of Rome was in marvellous 
uproar and discord, the nobility against the commonalty,
and chiefly for Martius' condemnation and banishment. Moreover
the priests, the soothsayers, and private men also, came
and declared to the Senate certain sights and wonders in the
air, which they had seen, and were to be considered of: amongst
the which such a vision happened: There was a citizen of Rome
called Titus Latinus, a man of mean quality and condition, but
otherwise an honest sober man, given to a quiet life, without
superstition, and much less to vanity or lying. This man had
a vision in his dream, in the which he thought that Jupiter appeared
unto him, and commanded him to signify to the Senate,
that they had caused a very vile lewd dancer to go before the
procession: and said, the first time this vision had appeared
unto him, he made no reckoning of it: and coming again another
time into his mind, he made not much more account of the
matter than before. In the end, he saw one of his sons die,
who had the best nature and condition of all his brethren: and
suddenly he himself was so taken in all his limbs, that he became
lame and impotent. Hereupon he told the whole circumstance
of this vision before the Senate, sitting upon his little
couch or bed, whereon he was carried on men's arms: and he
had no sooner reported this vision to the Senate, but he

<term>presently</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">at once.</note>
felt his body and limbs restored again to their former 
strength and use. So raising up himself upon his couch, he
got up on his feet at that instant, and walked home to his
house, without help of any man. The Senate being amazed at
this matter, made diligent enquiry to understand the truth:
and in the end they found there was such a thing: There was
one that had delivered a bondman of his that had offended him
into the hands of other slaves and bondmen, and had commanded
them to whip him up and down the market-place, and
afterwards to kill him: and as they had him in 
<term>execution</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">punishment.</note>,

whipping him cruelly, they did so 
<term>martyr</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">torture.</note>
the poor wretch, that,
<pb n="26"/>
for the cruel smart and pain he felt, he turned and writhed his
body in strange and pitiful sort. The procession by chance
came by even at the same time, and many that followed it
were heartily moved and offended with the sight, saying: that
this was no good sight to behold, nor meet to be met in procession
time. But for all this, there was nothing done: saving
they blamed and rebuked him that punished his slave so cruelly.
For the Romans at that time did use their bondmen very
gently, because they themselves did labour with their own
hands, and lived with them and among them: and therefore
they did use them the more gently and familiarly. For the
greatest punishment they gave a slave that had offended, was
this. <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">The Romans' manner of punishing their slaves.</note>They made him carry a

                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">limber, shaft.</note>

that no man would ever trust him after, and they called him

                  <name>Furcifer</name>, because the Latins call the wood that runneth into the

<milestone n="25" unit="para"/>Now
when Latinus had made report to the Senate of the vision that
had happened to him, they were devising whom this unpleasant
dancer should be, that went before the procession. Thereupon
certain that stood by remembered the poor slave that was so
cruelly whipped through the market-place, whom they afterwards
put to death: and the thing that made him remember it;
was the strange and rare manner of h s punishment. The
priests hereupon were repaired unto for their advice: they were
wholly of opinion, that it was the whipping of the slave. So
they caused the slave's master to be punished, and began again
a new procession, and all other shows and sights in honour of
Jupiter. But hereby appeareth plainly, <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">A ceremony instituted by king Numa touching religion.</note>how king Numa did
wisely ordain all other ceremonies concerning devotion to the

                  <name>Thensa</name>, one of the coachhorses
that drew them stood still and would draw no more,
and because also the coach-man took the reins of his bridle
with the left hand, they ordained that the procession should be
begun again anew. Of late time also, they did renew and begin
a sacrifice thirty times one after another, because they

                  <milestone n="15" ed="Skeat" unit="chapter"/> Now Tullus and Martius had secret conference with
the greatest personages of the city of Antium, declaring unto
them that now they had good time offered them to make war
with the Romans, while they were in dissension one with another.
They answered them, they were ashamed to break the
league, considering that they were sworn to keep peace for two
years. <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">The Romans gave the Volsces occasion of was.</note> Howbeit, shortly after, the Romans gave them great

Consuls to accuse the Volsces falsely, advertising them how
they had made a conspiracy to set upon them while they were
busy in seeing these games, and also to set their city on fire.
This open proclamation made all the Volsces more offended
with the Romans than ever they were before: and Tullus, aggravating
the matter, did so inflame the Volsces against them,
that in the end they sent their ambassadors to Rome, to summon
them to deliver their lands and towns again, which they

The Romans, hearing this, were marvellously nettled: and made
no other answer but this: " If the Volsces be the first that begin
war, the Romans will be the last that will end it."

                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">immediately.</note>

This done, Tullus did counsel them to take Martius into their

he would do them more service in fighting for them than ever

with the people because they had so unjustly

the other side, accused the nobility, how they had procured
Martius to make these wars to be revenged of them: because it
pleased them to see their goods burnt and spoiled before their
eyes, whilst themselves were well at ease, and did behold the
people's losses and misfortunes, knowing their own goods safe
and out of danger: and how the war was not made against the
noblemen, that had the enemy abroad to keep that they had in
safety. Now Martius, having done his first exploit (which made
the Volsces bolder, and less fearful of the Romans), brought
home all the army again without loss of any man. 

<milestone n="28" unit="para"/>After their
whole army (which was marvellous great, and very forward to
<pb n="29"/>
service) was assembled in one camp, they agreed to leave part
of it for garrison in the country about, and the other part
should go on and make the war upon the Romans. So Martius
bade Tullus choose, and take which of the two charges he
liked best. Tullus made him answer, he knew by experience
that Martius was no less valiant than himself, and how he ever
had better fortune and good hap in all battles than himself
had. Therefore he thought it best for him to have the leading
of those that would make the wars abroad, and himself would

<milestone n="16" ed="Skeat" unit="chapter"/> So Martius, being stronger than before, went first of all
unto the city of

                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">Circcii.</note>,
inhabited by the Romans, who willingly
yielded themselves, and therefore had no hurt. From thence
he entered the country of the Latins, imagining the Romans
would fight with him there to defend the Latins, who were their
confederates, and had many times sent unto the Romans for
their aid. But on the one side, the people of Rome were very

<term>ill willing</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">unwilling</note>
to go: and on the other side, the Consuls being upon

of their office, would not hazard themselves for so
small a time: so that the ambassadors of the Latins returned
home again, and did no good. Then Martius did besiege their
cities, and having taken by force the town of the Tolerinians,
Vicanians, Pedanians, and the Bolanians, who made resistance,
he sacked all their goods and took them prisoners. Such as
did yield themselves willingly unto him, he was as careful as

should receive no damage

                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">with his consent.</note>,
he removed his camp as

<milestone n="29" unit="para"/>Afterwards, he took the

                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">Bola or Bolla.</note>
by assault, being about an hundred furlong from
Rome, where he had a marvellous great spoil, and put every
man to the sword that was able to carry weapon. The other
Volsces that were appointed to remain in garrison for defence
of their country, hearing this good news, would tarry no longer
at home, but armed themselves and ran to Martius' camp,
saying they did acknowledge no other captain but him. Hereupon
his fame ran through all Italy, and every one praised him
for a valiant captain, for that, by change of one man for another,
such and so strange events fell out in the state. 
<term>In this while</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">meanwhile</note>,

all went still to wrack at Rome. For, to come into the field to
fight with the enemy, they could not abide to hear of it, they
were one so much against another, and full of seditious words,
<pb n="30"/>
the nobility against the people, and the people against the
nobility. Until they had intelligence

and from whence came first their ancient original, for that
Aeneas at his first arrival into Italy did build that city. Then
fell there out a marvellous sudden change of mind among the
people, and far more strange and contrary in the nobility.
For the people thought it good to repeal the condemnation and
exile of Martius. The Senate, assembled upon it, would in no
case yield to that: who either did it of a selfwill to be contrary
to the people's desire: or because Martius should not return

<term>thorough</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">through.</note>
the grace and favour of the people. Or else, because
they were throughly angry and offended with him, that he
would set upon the whole, being offended but by a few, and in
his doings would shew himself an open enemy besides unto his
country: notwithstanding the most part of them took the wrong
they had done him in marvellous ill part, and as if the injury
had been done unto themselves. Report being made of the
Senate's resolution, the people found themselves in a 
<term>straight</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">strait.</note>:

for they could authorise and confirm nothing by their voices,
unless it had been first propounded and ordained by the Senate.


<milestone n="30" unit="para"/>But Martius, hearing this stir about him, was in a greater rage
with them than before: inasmuch as he raised his siege 
<term>incontinently</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">at once.</note>

before the city of Lavinium, and going towards Rome,
lodged his camp within forty furlong of the city, at the ditches
called Cluiliae. His incamping so near Rome did put all the
whole city in a wonderful fear: howbeit for the present time it
appeased the sedition and dissension betwixt the nobility and
the people. For there was no consul, senator, nor magistrate,

<milestone n="17" ed="Skeat" unit="chapter"/> When they saw the women in a marvellous fear, running
up and down the city: the temples of the gods full of old
people, weeping bitterly in their prayers to the gods: and finally,
not a man either wise or hardy to provide for their safety: then
they were ale of opinion, that the people had reason to call
home Martius again, to reconcile themselves to him, and that
the Senate, on the contrary part, were in marvellous great fault

Howbeit they found nothing less: for at their coming they were

having the chiefest men of the Volsces about him: so he commanded
them to declare openly the cause of their coming.
Which they delivered in the most humble and lowly words they
possibly could devise, and with all modest countenance and
behaviour agreeable to the same. When they had done their
message,

them to restore unto the Volsces all their lands and

that they should give them the like honour and freedom of

which was a loss of great importance, because it was that
which in reason might both loose and bind all, and preserve

the whole. Now Martius having given the Romans thirty days
respite for their answer, and specially because the wars have
not accustomed to make any great changes in less space of
time than that, he thought it good

not to lie asleep and

so mistrustful, and loth besides to make wars. Insomuch
as they properly resembled the bodies paralytic and
loosed of their limbs and members, as those which through the
palsy have lost all their sense and feeling.

<milestone n="18" ed="Skeat" unit="chapter"/> Wherefore, the time of peace expired, Martius being

of the Volsces out of their country: that afterwards
they might with better leisure fall to such agreements
together as should be thought most meet and necessary. For
the Romans were no men that would ever yield for fear. But
if he thought the Volsces had any ground to demand reasonable
articles and conditions, all that they would reasonably ask
should be granted unto by the Romans, who of themselves
would willingly yield to reason, conditionally, that they did lay
down arms. Martius to that answered: 'that, as general of the
Volsces, he would reply nothing unto it: but yet, as a Roman
citizen, he would counsel them to let fall their pride, and to be
conformable to reason, if they were wise: and that they should
return again within three days, delivering up the articles agreed
upon, which he had first delivered them. Otherwise, that he
would no more give them assurance or safe conduct to return
again into his camp with such vain and frivolous messages.'


<milestone n="32" unit="para"/>When the ambassadors were returned to Rome, and had reported
Martius' answer to the Senate: their city being in
extreme danger, and as it were in a terrible storm or tempest,
they threw out (as the common proverb saith) their holy anchor.
<note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">The priests and soothsayers sent to Coriolanus.</note>For then they appointed all the bishops, priests, ministers of
the gods, and keepers of holy things, and all the augurs or
soothsayers, which foreshew things to come by observation of
the flying of birds (which is an old ancient kind of prophesying
and divination amongst the Romans) to go to Martius, apparelled
as when they do their sacrifices: and first to intreat him
to leave off war, and then that he would speak to his countrymen,
<pb n="33"/>
and conclude peace with the Volsces. Martius suffered
them to come into his camp, but yet he granted them 
<term>nothing the more</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">none the more.</note>,
neither did he entertain them or speak more courteously
to them, than he did the first time that they came unto
him, saving only that he willed them to take the one of the
two: either to accept peace under the first conditions offered,
or else to receive war. When all this goodly rabble of superstitious
priests were returned, it was determined in council that
none should go out of the gates of the city, and that they should
watch and ward upon the walls to repulse their enemies if they
came to assault them: referring themselves and all their hope
to time, and fortune's uncertain favour, not knowing otherwise
how to remedy the danger. Now all the city was full of tumult,
fear, and marvellous doubt what would happen, until at the
length there fell out such a like matter, as Homer ofttimes said
they would least have thought of. For in great matters, that
happen seldom, Homer saith, and crieth out in this sort:

in former age, when they procured loving peace, instead of
hateful war, between their fathers and their husbands. Come

intreat him to take pity upon us, and also to report the truth
unto him, how much you are bound unto the citizens: who
notwithstanding they have sustained great hurt and losses by
him, yet they have not hitherto sought revenge upon your persons
by any discourteous usage, neither ever conceived any
such thought or intent against you, but to deliver you safe
into his hands, though thereby they look for no better grace
or clemency from him." When Valeria had spoken this unto
them, all the other ladies together, with one voice, confirmed 
that she had said. Then Volumnia in this sort did answer 
her: <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">The answer of Volumnia to the Roman ladies.</note>"My good ladies, we are partakers with you of the common

than of any love to defend his person. But yet the greatest
grief of our heaped mishaps is to see our poor country brought
to such extremity, that all the hope of the safety and preservation
thereof is now unfortunately cast upon us simple
women: because we know not what account he will make of 
us, since he hath cast from him all care of his natural country

and commonweal, which heretofore he hath holden more dear
and precious than either his mother, wife, or children. Notwithstanding,
if ye think we can do good, we will willingly do
w hat you will have us; bring us to him, I pray you. For if we
cannot prevail, we may yet die at his feet, as humble suitors

was not a man among them that once durst say a word unto

the honours of a general, and when he had spied the women
coming afar off, he marvelled what the matter meant: but
afterwards knowing his wife which came foremost, he determined
at the first to persist in his obstinate and inflexible rancour.

And nature so wrought with him that the tears fell

so as that which is the only comfort to all other in their adversity

to our country and for safety of thy life also: but a world

upon us, are forcibly wrapt up in our prayers. For the bitter
sop of most hard choice is offered thy wife and children, to
forego one of the two: either to lose the person of thyself, or
the nurse of their native country. For myself, my son, I am
determined not to tarry till fortune, in my lifetime, do make an
end of this war. For if I cannot persuade thee, rather to do
good unto both parties than to overthrow and destroy the one,
preferring love and nature before the malice and calamity of

them, and of his natural country. For
if it were so, that my request tended to save thy country, in

destroying the Volsces, I must confess, thou wouldest hardly
and doubtfully resolve on that. For as, to destroy thy natural
country, it is altogether unmeet and unlawful, so were it not
just, and less honourable, to betray those that put their trust
in thee. But my

demand consisteth, to make a gaol-delivery
of all evils, which delivereth equal benefit and safety
both to the one and the other, but most honourable for the
Volsces. For it shall appear, that, having victory in their
hands, they have of special favour granted us singular graces,
peace, and amity, albeit themselves have no less part of both
than we. Of which good, if so it came to pass, thyself is the

and fall out contrary, thyself alone deservedly shalt carry the
shameful reproach and burthen of either party. So, though the
end of war be uncertain, yet this notwithstanding is most certain,
that, if it be thy chance to conquer, this benefit shalt thou

and danger their city stood of this war, when they were delivered.
For so soon as the watch upon the walls of the city perceived

<term>presently</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">at once.</note>
set open, and full of men wearing garlands of
flowers upon their heads, sacrificing to the gods, as they were
wont to do upon the news of some great obtained victory. And
this common joy was yet more manifestly shewed by the honourable
courtesies the whole Senate and people did bestow on
their ladies. For they were all 
<term>throughly</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">thoroughly.</note>
persuaded, and did
certainly believe, that the ladies only were cause of the saving of

<term>instant</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">urgent.</note>
danger of
the war. Whereupon the Senate ordained that the magistrates,
to gratify and honour these ladies, should grant them all that
they would require. <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">The temple of Fortune built for the women.</note>And they only requested that they would

whereof they offered themselves to defray the whole charge of

and forwardness, ordained that the temple and image should be
made at the common charge of the city. Notwithstanding that,
<pb n="39"/>
the ladies gathered money among them, and made with the
same a second image of Fortune, which the Romans say did
speak as they offered her up in the temple and did set her in
her place: and they affirm, that she spake these words: <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">The image of Fortune spake to the ladies at Romen.</note>"Ladies,
ye have devoutly offered me up." 

<milestone n="38" unit="para"/>Moreover, that she spake that
twice together: making us to believe things that never were, and
are not to be credited. For to see images that seem to sweat or
weep, or to put forth any humour red or bloody, it is not a thing

<term>unpossible</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">impossible.</note>.
For wood and stone do commonly receive certain
moisture, whereof are ingendered humours, which do yield of
themselves, or do take of the air, many sorts and kinds of spots
and colours: by which signs and tokens it is not amiss, me think,
that the gods sometimes do warn men of things to come. And
it is possible also, that these images and statues do sometimes
put forth sounds like unto sighs or mourning, when in the midst
or bottom of the same there is made some violent separation or
breaking asunder of things blown or devised therein: but that
a body which hath neither life nor soul should have any direct
or 
<term>exquisite</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">exact, distinct</note>
words formed in it by express voice, that is altogether

For the soul nor God himself can distinctly speak
without a body, having necessary organs and instruments meet
for the parts of the same, to form and utter distinct words. But
where stories many times do force us to believe a thing reported
to be true, by many grave testimonies: there we must say, that
it is some passion contrary to our five natural senses, which being
begotten in the imaginative part or understanding draweth
an opinion unto itself, even as we do in our sleeping. For many
times we think we hear that we do not hear, and we imagine we
see that we see not. Yet notwithstanding, such as are godly
bent and zealously given to think on heavenly things, so as they
can no way be drawn from believing that which is spoken of
them, they have this reason to ground the foundation of their
belief upon; <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Of the omnipotency of God.</note>that is, the

saith, for lack of faith, are hidden and unknown unto us.

                  <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Tullus Aufidius seeketh to kill Coriolanus.</note>Now when Martius was returned again into the city of
Antium from his voyage, Tullus, that hated and could no longer
abide him for the fear he had of his authority, sought diverse
means to make him away; thinking, if he let slip that present
time, he should never recover the like and fit occasion again.
Wherefore Tullus, having procured many other of his confederacy,

<term>required</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">demanded that.</note>
Martius might be deposed from his estate, to render up
account to the Volsces of his charge and government. Martius,
fearing to become a private man again under Tullus being
general (whose authority was greater otherwise than any other
among all the Volsces), answered: he was willing to give up his
charge, and would resign it into the hands of the lords of the
Volsces, if they did all command him, as by all their commandment
he received it. And moreover, that he would not refuse
even at that present to give up an account unto the people, if
they would tarry the hearing of it The people hereupon called
a common council, in which assembly there were certain orators
appointed that stirred up the common people against him: and
when they had told their tales, Martius rose up to make them
answer. Now, notwithstanding the mutinous people made a
marvellous great noise, yet when they saw him, for the reverence
they bare unto his valiantness, they quieted themselves, and
gave him audience to allege with leisure what he could for his

Moreover, the 
<term>honestest</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">most honourable.</note>
men of the Antiates, and
who most rejoiced in peace, shewed by their countenance that
they would hear him willingly and judge also according to
their conscience. Whereupon Tullus, fearing that, if he did let
him speak, he would prove his 
<term>innocency</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">innocence.</note>
to the people, because
amongst other things he had an eloquent tongue; besides that
the first good service he had done to the people of the Volsces
did win him more favour than these last accusations could 
<term>purchase</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">procure.</note>

 him displeasure: and furthermore, the offence they laid to
his charge was a testimony of the goodwill they 
<term>ought</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">owed.</note>
him; for
they would never have thought he had done them wrong for that
they took not the city of Rome, if they had not been very near
taking of it by means of his approach and 
<term>conduction</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">guidance.</note>.
For
these causes Tullus thought he might no longer delay his 
<term>pretence</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">intention.</note>

and enterprise, neither to tarry for the

                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">mutinying.</note>
and rising of
the common people against him: wherefore those that were of
the conspiracy began to cry out that he was not to be heard,
and that they would not suffer a traitor to usurp tyrannical power
over the tribe of the Volsces, who would not yield up his state

and authority. <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Coriolanus murdered in the city of Antium.</note>And in saying these words, they all fell upon

men came out of all parts to honour his body, and did honourably
bury him; setting out his tomb with great store of armour
and spoils, as the tomb of a worthy person and great captain.
The Romans, understanding of his death, shewed no other
honour or malice, saving that they granted the ladies their
request they made, that they might mourn ten months for him:

promising to be obedient at their commandment.</p>

had Caesar put away his wife Cornelia, the daughter of Cinna

The cause of Caesar's ill will unto Sylla was by means of marriage: 
<pb n="43"/>
for Marius the elder married his father's own sister, by
whom he had Marius the younger, whereby Caesar and he were
cousin-germans. Sylla being troubled in weighty matters, putting
to death so many of his enemies, when he came to be
conqueror, he made no reckoning of Caesar: and he was
not contented to be hidden in safety, but came and made suit

Sylla's means, that secretly was against him. Who, when he
was determined to have killed him, some of his friends told him,
that it was to no purpose to put so young a boy as he to death.
But Sylla told them again, that they did not

there were many Marians in that young boy. Caesar understanding
that, stole out of Rome, and hid himself a long time
in the country of the Sabines, wandering still from place to
place. But one day being carried from house to house, he fell
into the hands of Sylla's soldiers, who searched all those places,
and took them whom they found hidden. Caesar bribed the
captain, whose name was Cornelius, with two talents which he
gave him.

<milestone n="2" ed="Skeat" unit="chapter"/> After he had escaped them thus, he went unto the seaside,

for those pirates kept all upon the sea-coast, with a great fleet

for his ransom, Caesar laughed them to scorn, as though they
knew not what a man they had taken, and of himself promised
them fifty talents. <milestone n="2" unit="para"/>Then he sent his men up and down to get

no noise. Thus was he thirty-eight days among them, not kept
as prisoner, but rather waited upon by them as a prince. All

But this Praetor, having a great fancy to be fingering of the

would consider of these prisoners at better leisure. Caesar,
leaving Junius there, returned again unto Pergamus, and there
hung up all these thieves openly upon a cross, as he had oftentimes

                  <milestone n="3" ed="Skeat" unit="chapter"/> Afterwards when Sylla's power began to decay, Caesar's
friends wrote unto him, to pray him to come home again. But
he sailed first unto Rhodes, to study there a time under Apollonius
the son of Molon, whose scholar also Cicero was, for
he was a very honest man and an excellent good rhetorician.
It is reported, that <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Caesar's eloquence.</note> Caesar had an excellent natural gift to speak
well before the people; and besides that rare gift, he was excellently
well studied, so that doubtless he was counted the second
man for eloquence in his time, and gave place to the first,
because he would be the first and chiefest man of war and
authority, being not yet come to the degree of perfection to
speak well, which his nature could have performed in him,
because he was given rather to follow wars and to manage great
matters, which in the end brought him to be lord of all Rome.
And therefore in a book he wrote against that which Cicero
made in the praise of Cato, he prayeth the readers not to compare
the style of a soldier with the eloquence of an excellent
orator, that had followed it the most part of his life. <milestone n="4" unit="para"/>When he
was returned again unto Rome, he accused Dolabella for his ill
behaviour in the government of his provinces, and he had divers
cities of Greece that gave in evidence against him. Notwithstanding,
Dolabella at the length was dismissed. Caesar, to

<pb n="45"/>
requite the good will of the Grecians which they had shewed
him in his accusation of Dolabella, took their cause in hand,
when they did accuse Publius Antonius before Marcus Lucullus,
Praetor of Macedon: and followed it so hard against him in
their behalf, that Antonius was driven to appeal before the
tribunes at Rome, alleging, to colour his appeal withal, that
he could have no justice in Greece against the Grecians. Now
Caesar immediately 
<term>wan</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">won.</note> many men's good wills at Rome,
through his eloquence in pleading of their causes, and the
people loved him marvellously also, because of the courteous
manner he had to speak to every man, and to use them gently,
being more ceremonious therein than was 
<term>looked for</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">expected.</note> in one of
his years. Furthermore, <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Caesar loved hospitality.</note> he ever kept a good board, and fared
well at his table, and was very liberal besides: the which indeed
did advance him forward, and brought him in estimation with
the people. His enemies, judging that this <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Caesar a follower of the common people.</note> favour of the common
people would soon 
<term>quail</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">fail.</note>, when he could no longer 
hold
out that charge and expense, suffered him to run on, till by
little and little he was grown to be of great strength and power.
But in fine, when they had thus given him the bridle to grow to
this greatness, and that they could not then pull him back, though
indeed 
<term>in sight</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">it was evident.</note> it would turn one day to the destruction of the
whole state and commonwealth of Rome: too late they found,
that there is not so little a beginning of any thing, but continuance
of time will soon make it strong, when through contempt
there is no impediment to hinder the greatness.

<milestone n="4" ed="Skeat" unit="chapter"/> Thereupon Cicero, like a wise shipmaster that feareth
the calmness of the sea, was the first man that, mistrusting his

proof than the first, was at the death of his aunt Julia, the

Sylla's victory, because that Marius and all his confederates had
been proclaimed traitors and enemies to the commonwealth.
For when there were some that cried out upon Caesar for doing

the faction of Sylla, which was very strong and of great power;

and the other of Marius, which then was under foot, and durst

The next morning, when every man saw the glistering of these
golden images excellently well wrought, shewing by the inscriptions
that they were the victories which Marius had won upon
the Cimbres, every one marvelled much at the boldness of him
that durst set them up there, knowing well enough who it was.
Hereupon it ran straight through all the city, and every man
came thither to see them. <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Caesar accused to make a rebellion in the state.</note>Then some cried out upon Caesar,
and said, it was a tyranny which he meant to set up, by renewing

it was no more but a bait to gauge the people's good wills, which
he had set out in the stately shews of his common plays, to see
if he had brought them to his lure, that they would abide such
parts to be played, and a new alteration of things to be made.
They of Marius' faction on the other side, encouraging one
another, shewed themselves straight a great number gathered
together, and made the mount of the Capitol ring again with
their cries and clapping of hands: insomuch as the tears ran
down many of their cheeks, for very joy, when they saw the

him the worthiest man of all the

the greatest authority at that time in Rome, rose, and vehemently
inveighed against Caesar, and spake that then which
ever since hath been noted much: that Caesar did not now
covertly go to work, but by plain force sought to alter the state
of the commonwealth. Nevertheless, Caesar at that time answered
him so, that the Senate was satisfied. Thereupon they

to Cato and Catulus to speak. They both did sharply inveigh
against him, but Cato chiefly: who in <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Cato's oration against Caesar.</note>his oration made Caesar
suspected to be of the conspiracy, and stoutly spake against
him, insomuch that the offenders were put into the hands of
the officers to be put to death. Caesar coming out of the
Senate, a company of young men which guarded Cicero for
the safety of his person, did set upon him with their swords
drawn. But some say, that Curio covered Caesar with his gown,
and took him out of their hands. And Cicero self, when the
young men looked upon him, beckoned with his head that they
should not kill him, either fearing the fury of the people, or
else that he thought it too shameful and wicked a part. But
if that were true, I marvel why Cicero did not put it into his
book he wrote of his consulship. But certainly they blamed him
afterwards, for that he took not the opportunity offered him
against Caesar, only for overmuch fear of the people, that loved
him very dearly. For shortly after, when Caesar went into the
Senate, to clear himself of certain presumptions and false accusations
objected against him, and being bitterly taunted among
them, the Senate keeping him longer than they were wont:
the people came about the council-house, and called out aloud
for him, bidding them let him out. Cato then, fearing the
insurrection of the poor needy persons, which were they that
put all their hope in Caesar, and did also move the people to stir,
did persuade the Senate to make a

mother. Howbeit the Romans hold opinion, that it is a nymph
of the woods married unto the god Faunus. The Grecians, they
say also, that she was one of the mothers of the god Bacchus,
whom they dare not name. And for proof hereof, on her feastday,
the women make certain tabernacles of vine-twigs, and
leaves of vine-branches; and also they make, as the tale goeth,
a holy dragon for this goddess, and do set it by her: besides, it
is not lawful for any man to be present at their sacrifices, no,
not within the house itself where they are made. Furthermore

village that had not many households, and yet poor cottages.
There his friends that did accompany him asked him merrily,
if there were any contending for offices in that town, and whether
there were any strife there amongst the noblemen for honour.
Caesar speaking in good earnest, answered: "I cannot tell that,"
said he, "but for my part I had rather be the chiefest man here
than the second person in Rome." Another time also when he
was in Spain, reading the history of Alexander's acts, when he
had read it, he was sorrowful a good while after, and then burst
out in weeping. His friends seeing that, marvelled what should
be the cause of his sorrow. He answered them, " Do ye not
think," said he, " that I have good cause to be heavy, when king

so that he

                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">won.</note> their ship from them. And Cassius Scaeva also,
in a conflict before the city of Dyrrachium, having one of his
eyes put out with an arrow, his shoulder stricken through with
a dart, and his thigh with another, and having received thirty
arrows upon his shield, he called to his enemies, and made as
though he would yield unto them. But when two of them came
running to him, he crave one of their shoulders from his body
with his sword, and hurt the other in the face: so that he made
him turn his back, and at the length saved himself, by means of
his companions that came to help him. And in Britain also,
when the captains of the bands were driven into a

                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">marsh</note> or

Then this soldier, being the hindmost man of all the captains,
marching with great pain through the mire and dirt, half swimming
and half on foot, in the end got to the other side, but left
his shield behind him. Caesar, wondering at his noble courage,
ran to him with joy to embrace him. But the poor soldier
hanging down his head, the water standing in his eyes, fell
down at Caesar's feet, and besought him to pardon him, for that
he had left his target behind him. And in Africa also, Scipio

in them. First, for that he gave them bountifully, and did
honour them also, strewing thereby, that he did not heap up
riches in the wars to maintain his life afterwards in wantonness
and pleasure, but that he did keep it in store, honourably to
reward their valiant service: and that by so much he thought
himself rich, by how much he was liberal in rewarding of them
that had deserved it. Furthermore, they did not wonder so much
at his valiantness in putting himself at every instant in such
manifest danger, and in taking so extreme pains as he did,
knowing that it was his greedy desire of honour that set him on
fire, and pricked him forward to do it: but that he always continued

and

<term>sickness</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">epilepsy.</note>
(the which took him the first time, as it is reported, 
in Corduba,
a city of Spain :) but yet therefore yielded not to the
disease of his body, to make it a cloak to cherish him withal,
but contrarily, took the pains of war as a medicine to cure his
sick body, fighting always with his disease, travelling continually,
living soberly, and commonly lying abroad in the field.
For the most nights he slept in his coach or litter, and thereby
bestowed his rest, to make him always able to do something:
and in the day-time he would travel up and down the country
to see towns, castles, and strong places. He had always a
secretary with him in the coach, who did 
<term>still</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">continually.</note> write as he went
by the way, and a soldier behind him that carried his sword.
He made such speed the first time he came from Rome, when 
he had his office, that in eight days he came to the River of
Rhone. He was so excellent a rider of horse from his youth,
that holding his hands behind him, he would gallop his horse
upon the spur. In his wars in Gaul, he did further exercise

that Caesar was the first that devised friends might talk together

to have abstained to eat of that they misliked, and not to shame
their friend, and how that he lacked good manners that found
fault with his friend. Another time, as he travelled through the
country, he was driven by foul weather on the sudden to take a
poor man's cottage, that had but one little cabin in it, and that
was so narrow, that one man could but scarce lie in it. Then he
said to his friends that were about him: " Greatest rooms are
meetest for greatest men, and the most necessary rooms for the
sickest persons." And thereupon he called Oppius that was
sick to lie there all night: and he himself, with the rest of his

saying that the enemies were no valianter than the Cimbri had
been, nor that he was a captain inferior unto Marius. This

them not to fight until the new moon. Caesar having intelligence
thereof, and perceiving that the barbarous people thereupon
stirred not, thought it best then to set upon them, being
discouraged with this superstitious fear, rather than, losing time,
he should tarry their leisure. So he did skirmish with them
even to their forts and little hills where they lay, and by this
means provoked them so, that with great fury they came down
to fight. <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">King Ariovistus overthrown by Caesar.</note>There he overcame them in battle, and followed them

his men. It is said that there were slain fourscore thousand

thinking of the affairs at Rome, went over the mountains into
Gaul about the river of Po, being part of his province which he
had in charge. For there the river called Rubico divideth the

his army against the Nervians, the stoutest warriors of all the

run unto him from the top of the hill where they stood in

a Roman escaped alive that day. But taking example of
Caesar's valiantness, they fought desperately beyond their power,
and <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">The Nervii slain by Caesar.</note>yet could not make the Nervians fly, but they fought it out

only but five hundred: and of four hundred gentlemen and

it at Rome, ordained that they should do sacrifice unto
the gods, and keep feasts and solemn processions fifteen days
together without intermission, having never made the like ordinance
at Rome for any victory that ever was obtained: because
they saw the danger had been marvellous great, so many nations
rising as they did in arms together against him: and further, the
love of the people unto him made his victory much more
famous.

<milestone n="21" ed="Skeat" unit="chapter"/> For when Caesar had set his affairs

sixscore sergeants carrying rods and axes before the Magistrates:
and above two hundred Senators besides. There they fell in
consultation, and determined that Pompey and Crassus should
again be chosen Consuls the next year following. Furthermore
they did appoint, that Caesar should have money again
delivered him to pay his army; and besides, did prorogue the
time of his government five years further. This was thought
a very strange and an unreasonable matter unto wise men;
for they themselves that had taken so much money of Caesar,
persuaded the Senate to let him have money of the common
treasure, as though he had had none before: yea, to speak
more plainly, they compelled the Senate unto it, sighing and
lamenting to see the decrees they passed. Cato was not there
then, for they had purposely sent him before into Cyprus.
Howbeit Faonius, that followed Cato's steps, when he saw that
he could not prevail nor withstand them, he went out of the
Senate in choler, and cried out amongst the people that it
was a horrible shame. But no man did hearken to him: some
for the reverence they bare unto Pompey and Crassus; and
others, favouring Caesar s proceedings, did put all their hope
and trust in him: and therefore did quiet themselves, and
stirred not.

caused his whole army to march against them, thinking it a
folly and madness to keep faith with such traitorous barbarous
breakers of leagues. Canutius writeth, that the Senate appointing
again to do new sacrifice, processions, and feasts, to give
thanks to the gods for this victory, Cato was of contrary opinion,
that Caesar should be delivered into the hands of the barbarous

the first Roman that ever passed over the river of Rheyn with an
army, he built a bridge over it. <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Caesar made a bridge over the river of Rhine.</note>This river is marvellous broad,

river (which the stream bringeth down with it) did with the
great blows and force thereof marvellously shake the posts of
the bridge he had set up. But to prevent the blows of those
trees, and also to break the fury of the stream, he made a
pile of great wood above the bridge a good way, and did
forcibly ram them into the bottom of the river; so that in ten
days space he had set up and finished his bridge of the goodliest
carpenters' work, and most excellent invention

Alexia, besides them that were within the city, which amounted
to the number of threescore and ten thousand fighting men at 
the least: so that perceiving he was shut in betwixt two so

the one against them of the city, and the other against them 

<term>without</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">outside.</note>. For if those two armies had joined together, Caesar

and the battle he

                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">won</note> before it, did deservedly win him more

                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">urgent.</note>
and extreme danger, he shewed more valiantness and wisdom
than he did in any battle he fought before. But what a wonderful
thing was this! that they of the city never heard anything
of them that came to aid them until Caesar had overcome them
and furthermore, that the Romans themselves, which kept watch
upon the wall that was built against the city, knew also no more
of it than they, until it was done, and that they heard the cries
and lamentations of men and women in Alexia, when they perceived
on the other side of the city such a number of 
<term>glistering</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">glittering.</note>
shields of gold and silver, such store of bloody corslets and
armours, such a deal of plate and moveables, and such a number
of tents and pavilions after the fashion of the Gauls, which the
Romans had gotten of their spoils in their camp! Thus suddenly
was this great army vanished, as a dream or vision:
where the most part of them were slain that day in battle
Furthermore, after that they within the city of Alexia had done

yielded themselves. And Vercingentorix (he that was their king

                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">trappings.</note>, and unarmed himself, and laid all on the ground, and
went and sat down at Caesar's feet, and said never a word. So
Caesar at length committed him as a prisoner taken in the wars,
to lead him afterwards in the triumph at Rome.

Caesar contrarily, having had that drift in his head from the beginning,

lacked no more to put his enterprise in execution, but some
occasions of 
<term>colour</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">pretext, excuse.</note>, which Pompey partly gave him, and partly
also the time delivered him, but chiefly, the hard fortune and ill
government at that time of the commonwealth at Rome.<note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">The people's voices bought at Rome for money.</note> For
they that made suit for honour and offices bought the voices of
the people with ready money, which they gave out openly to
usury, without shame or fear. Thereupon the common people
that had sold their voices for money, came to the market-place
at the day of election, to fight for him that had hired them: not
with their voices, but with their bows, slings, and swords. So
that the assembly seldom times brake up, but the pulpit for
orations was defiled and sprinkled with the blood of them that
were slain in the market-place, the city remaining all that time
without government of magistrate, like a ship left without a
pilot. Insomuch as men of deep judgment and discretion, seeing
such fury and madness of the people, thought themselves
happy if the commonwealth were no worse troubled than with
the absolute state of a monarchy and sovereign lord to govern
them. Furthermore, there were many that were not afraid to
speak it openly, that there was no other help to remedy the
troubles of the commonwealth, but by the authority of one man
only, that should command them all: and that this medicine
must be ministered by the hands of him that was the gentlest
physician, meaning covertly Pompey. Now Pompey used many
fine speeches, making semblance as though he would none of it,
and yet cunningly underhand did lay all the irons in the fire he
could, to bring it to pass that he might be chosen Dictator.
Cato finding the mark he shot at, and fearing lest in the end the
people should be compelled to make him Dictator, he persuaded
the Senate rather to make him sole Consul, that, contenting
himself with that more just and lawful government, he should
not covet the other unlawful. The Senate, following his counsel,
<pb n="69"/>
did not only make him Consul, but further did 
<term>prorogue</term>

government of the provinces he had. <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Pompey governed Spain and Africa.</note>For he had two provinces,

                  <milestone n="29" unit="para"/>Hereupon Caesar took occasion
also to send his men to make suit in his name for the consulship,
and also to have the government of his provinces 
prorogued.
Pompey at the first held his peace; but Marcellus and Lentulus
(that otherwise hated Caesar) withstood them, and, to shame and
dishonour him, had much needless speech in matters of weight.
Furthermore they took away the freedom from the colonies which
Caesar had lately brought unto the city of Novumcomum in
Gaul towards Italy, where Caesar not long before had lodged
them. And moreover, when Marcellus was Consul, he made
one of the senators in that city to be whipped with rods, who
came to Rome about those matters: and said, he gave him
those marks, that he should know he was no Roman citizen, and
bade him go his way, and tell Caesar of it.

<milestone n="28" ed="Skeat" unit="chapter"/> 
                  <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Caesar bribeth tha magistrates at Rome.</note>After Marcellus' consulship, Caesar, setting open his
coffers of the treasure he had gotten among the Gauls, did
frankly give it out amongst the magistrates at Rome, without
restraint or spare. First, he set Curio the tribune clear out of
debt: and gave also unto Paul the Consul a thousand five hundred
talents, with which money he built that notable palace by
the market-place, called Paul's Basilick, in the place of Fulvius'
Basilick. Then Pompey, being afraid of this 
<term>practice.</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">contrivance.</note>, began
openly to procure, both by himself and his friends, that they
should send Caesar a successor: and moreover, he sent unto
Caesar for his two legions of men of war, which he had lent
him for the conquest of Gaul. Caesar sent him them again,
and gave every private soldier two hundred and fifty silver
drachmas. Now, they that brought these two legions back
from Caesar, gave out ill and seditious words against him among
the people, and did also <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Pompey abused by flatterers.</note>abuse Pompey with false persuasions
and vain hopes, informing him that he was marvellously desired
and wished for in Caesar's camp: and though in Rome,
for the malice and secret spite which the governors there did
bear him, he could hardly obtain that he desired, yet in Gaul
he might assure himself, that all the army was at his commandment.
They added further also, that if the soldiers there did
once return over the mountains again into Italy, they would
all straight come to him, they did so hate Caesar, because he
<pb n="70"/>
wearied them with too much labour and continual fight: and
withal, for that they suspected he aspired to be king. These
words breeding security in Pompey, and a vain conceit of himself,
made him negligent in his doings, so that he made no
preparation of war, as though he had no occasion to be afraid:
but only studied to thwart Caesar in speech, and to 
<term>cross</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">thwart.</note> the
suits he made. Howbeit Caesar 
<term>passed not of</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">passed not over.</note> all this. For
the report went, that one of Caesar's captains which was sent
to Rome to prosecute his suit, being at the Senate-door, and
hearing that they denied to prorogue Caesar's time of government
which he sued for, clapping his hand upon his sword, he
said: " 
<term>Sith</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">Since</note> you will not grant it him, this shall give it him."
<milestone n="30" unit="para"/>Notwithstanding, <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Caesar's requests unto the Senate.</note>the requests that Caesar propounded carried
great semblance of reason with them. For he said, that he was
contented to lay down arms, so that Pompey did the like: and
that both of them, as private persons, should come and make
suit of their citizens to obtain honourable recompence: declaring
unto them that, taking arms from him, and granting
them unto Pompey, they did wrongfully accuse him 
<term>in</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">of</note> going
about to make himself a tyrant, and in the mean time to grant
the other means to be a tyrant. Curio making these offers and
persuasions openly before the people in the name of Caesar, he
was heard with great rejoicing and clapping of hands, and there
were some that cast flowers and nosegays upon him when he
went his way, as they commonly use to do unto any man, when
he hath obtained victory and won the games. Then Antonius,
one of the tribunes, brought a letter sent from Caesar, and

<term>made</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">caused.</note> it openly to be read in despite of the Consuls. But
Scipio in the Senate, Pompey's father-in-law, made this motion:
that if Caesar did not dismiss his army by a certain day appointed
him, the Romans should proclaim him an enemy unto
Rome. Then the Consuls openly asked in the presence of the
senators, if they thought it good that Pompey should dismiss
his army: but few agreed to that demand. After that again
they asked, if they liked that Caesar should dismiss his army:
thereto they all 
<term>in manner</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">apparently.</note> answered, "Yea, yea." But when
Antonius requested again that both of them should lay down
arms, then they were all 
<term>indifferently</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">impartially.</note> of his mind. Notwithstanding,
because Scipio did insolently behave himself, and
Marcellus also, who cried, that they must use force of arms and
not men's opinion against a thief, the Senate rose straight upon
it without further determination; and men changed apparel
<pb n="71"/>

through the city because of this dissension, as they 
<term>use</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">are wont.</note> to do
in a common calamity. <milestone n="31" unit="para"/>After that, there came other letters
from Caesar, which seemed much more reasonable: in the
which he requested that they would grant him Gaul that
lieth between the mountains of the Alps and Italy and Illyria,
with two legions only, and then that he would request nothing
else; until he made suit for the second Consulship. Cicero the
orator, that was newly come from the government of Cilicia,
travailed to reconcile them together, and pacified Pompey the
best he could: who told him he would yield to anything he
would have him, so he did let him alone with his army. So
Cicero persuaded Caesar's friends to be contented, to take those
two provinces, and six thousand men only, that they might be
friends and at peace together. Pompey very willingly yielded
unto it, and granted them. But Lentulus the Consul would not
agree to it, but shamefully

                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">drove.</note> Curio and Antonius out of the

Caesar had not in all about him above five thousand footmen
and three thousand horsemen: for the rest of his army he left
on the other side of the mountains, to be brought after him by
his lieutenants. So, considering that, for the execution of his
enterprise, he should not need so many men of war at the first
but rather, suddenly stealing upon them, to make them afraid
with valiantness, taking benefit of the opportunity of time; because
he should more easily make his enemies afraid of him
coming so suddenly when they looked not for him, than he
should otherwise distress them, assailing them with his whole
army, in giving them leisure to provide further for him: he
commanded his captains and lieutenants to go before, without
any other armour than their swords, to take the city of Ariminum
(a great city of Gaul, being the first city men come to,
when they come out of Gaul) with as little bloodshed and tumult
as they could possible. Then, committing that force and
army he had with him unto Hortensius, one of his friends, he
remained a whole day together, openly in the sight of every
man, to see the sword-players handle their weapons before him
At night he went into his lodging, and, bathing his body a

little, came afterwards into the hall amongst them, and made
merry a while with them whom he had bidden to supper. Then,
when it was well forward night, and very dark, he rose from the
table, and prayed his company to be merry, and no man to stir,
for he would straight come to them again: howbeit he had
secretly before commanded a few of his trustiest friends to follow
him; not 
<term>altogether</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">all together.</note>, but some one way, and some another
way. He himself in the mean time took a coach he had hired,
and made as though he would have gone some other way at the
first, but suddenly he turned back again towards the city of
Ariminum.

For in all places men were of contrary opinions, and there were
dangerous stirs and tumults everywhere, because they that
were glad of this trouble could keep in no certain place; but,
running up and down the city, when they met with others in
divers places that seemed either to be afraid or angry with this
tumult (as otherwise it is impossible in so great a city) they
flatly fell out with them, and boldly threatened them with that
that was to come. Pompey himself, who at that time was not
a little amazed, was yet much more troubled with the ill words
some gave him on the one side, and some on the other. For
some of them reproved him, and said, that he had done
wisely, and had paid for his folly, because he had made
Caesar so great and strong against him and the commonwealth.
And other again did blame him, because he had refused the
honest offers and reasonable conditions of peace which Caesar
had offered him, suffering Lentulus the Consul to abuse him toe
much. On the other side, Phaonius spake unto him, and bade
him stamp on the ground with his foot: for Pompey being one

of Saturn, but told him that it was against the law: "Tush,"

I have in my hands." When he had spoken thus unto
Metellus,<note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Caesar taketh money out of the temple of Saturn.</note> he went to the temple-door where the treasure lay,
and, finding no keys there, he caused smiths to be sent for,
and made them break open the locks. Metellus thereupon
began again to withstand him, and certain men that stood by
praised him in his doing: but Caesar at length, speaking bigly
to him, threatened him he would kill him presently, if he
troubled him any more: and told him furthermore, "Young

marching on, by small journeys came at length unto the city

Caesar had already passed over the sea, then they

ships returning back to transport them over. <milestone n="38" unit="para"/>Caesar in the

army to fight with Pompey, it grieved him for that the rest
of his army was so long a-coming, not knowing what way
to take. <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">A great adventure of Caesar.</note>In the end he followed a dangerous determination, to

of 12 oars only, to pass
over the sea again unto Brundusium, the which he could not
do without great danger, considering that all that sea was full of
Pompey's ships and armies. So he took ship in the night,
apparelled like a slave, and went aboard upon this little pinnace,
and said never a word, as if he had been some poor man of
mean condition. The pinnace lay in the mouth of the <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Anius fl.</note>river of
Anius, the which commonly was wont to be very calm and quiet,
by reason of a little wind that came from the shore, which every
morning

night (by ill fortune) there came a great wind from the sea, that
overcame the landwind, insomuch as, the force and strength
of the river fighting against the violence of the rage and waves
of the sea, the encounter was marvellous dangerous, the water
of the river being driven back and rebounding upward, with
great noise and danger in turning of the water. Thereupon
the master of the pinnace, seeing that he could not possibly
get out of the mouth of this river, bade the mariners to 
<term>cast about</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">turn around.</note> again, and to return against the stream. Caesar hearing
that, straight discovered himself unto the master of the pinnace,
who at the first was amazed when he saw him; but Caesar
then taking him by the hand, said unto him, " Good fellow,
be of good cheer, and forwards hardily; fear not, for thou hast
Caesar and his fortune with thee." Then the mariners, forgetting
the danger of the storm they were in,

get out of the mouth of this river. But at length, perceiving
they laboured in vain, and that the pinnace took in abundance
of water, and was ready to sink, Caesar then, to his great
grief, was driven to return back again: who when he was returned
unto his camp, his soldiers came in great companies
unto him, and were very sorry that he mistrusted he was not
able with them alone to overcome his enemies, but would put
his person in danger to go fetch them that were absent, putting

cast away. For Pompey came on with his battle upon them,
and they were not able to abide it, but were fought with, and
driven into their camp, and their trenches were filled with dead
bodies, which were slain within the very gate and bulwarks
of their camp, they were so valiantly pursued. Caesar stood
before them that fled, to make them to turn head again, but
he could not prevail. For when he would have taken the
ensigns to have stayed them, the ensign-bearers threw them
down on the ground: so that the enemies took two and thirty of
them, and Caesar's self also escaped hardly with life. For, striking
a great big soldier that fled by him, commanding him to

great extremity, that (if Pompey had not either for fear, or

troubled him more than any night that ever he had. For still
his mind ran with great sorrow of the foul fault he had committed
in leading of his army, of self-will to remain there so
long by the sea-side, his enemies being the stronger by sea,
considering that he had before him a goodly country, rich and
plentiful of all things, and goodly cities of Macedon and Thessaly:
and had not the wit to bring the war from thence, but to
lose his time in a place, where he was rather besieged of his
enemies for lack of victuals than that he did besiege them by
force of arms. Thus fretting and chafing to see himself so

he had been overcome and had fled. But for Pompey himself,
he would in no respect hazard battle, which was a matter of so
great importance. For finding himself so well provided of all

little strength that remained in Caesar's army: of the which, the
best men were marvellous well trained and good soldiers, and
for valiantness at one day's battle were incomparable. But on
the other side again, to remove here and there so oft, and to
fortify their camp where they came, and to besiege any wall, or
to keep watch all night in their armour: the most part of them
could not do it, by reason of their age, being then unable to

he was accused of treason, that for money he had sold his
army unto Caesar), he went busily asking, " why they fought not
with that merchant, unto whom they said he had sold the
province of Spain? " So that Pompey, with these kinds of
speeches, against his will, was driven to follow Caesar to fight
with him. Then was Caesar at the first marvellously perplexed
and troubled by the way, because he found none that would
give him any victuals, being despised of every man for the late
loss and overthrow he had received. But after he had taken the

any lucky sign or token of good luck. The soothsayer answered:
" For that, thou shalt answer thyself better than I can do: for
the gods do promise us a marvellous great change and alteration

Crassinius, what hope shall we have to-day? how are we determined,
to fight it out manfully? " Then Crassinius, casting
up his hand, answered him aloud: "This day, O Caesar, we
I shall have a noble victory, and I promise thee ere night thou
shalt praise me alive or dead." When he had told him so, he
was himself the foremost man that gave charge upon his enemies,

with his band following of him, being about six score men; and
making a lane through the foremost ranks with great slaughter,
he entered far into the battle of his enemies, until that, valiantly
fighting in this sort, he was thrust in at length into the mouth
with a sword, that the point of it came out again at his neck.

horsemen of the left wing of Pompey did march as fiercely also,
spreading out their troops, to compass in the right wing of
Caesar's battle. But before they began to give charge, the six
ensigns of footmen which Caesar had laid in ambush behind him,
they began to run full upon them, not throwing away their darts
far off, as they were wont to do, neither striking their enemies
on the thighs nor on the legs, but to seek to hit them full in the
eyes, and to hurt them in the face, as Caesar had taught them.
<note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Caesar's strategem.</note>For he hoped that these lusty young gentlemen that had not
been often in the wars nor were used to see themselves hurt,
and the which, being in the prime of their youth and beauty,
would be afraid of those hurts, as well for the fear of the
present danger to be slain, as also for that their faces should
not for ever be deformed. As indeed it came to pass, for they
could never abide that they should come so near their faces
with the points of their darts, but hung down their heads for
fear to be hit with them in their eyes, and turned their backs,
covering their face because they should not be hurt. Then,

words then in Latin, which he afterwards wrote in Greek; and
saith furthermore, that the most part of them which were put to
the sword in the camp were slaves and bondmen, and that there
were not slain in all this battle above six thousand soldiers. As

down again, to consider of the birds, after he had bethought
him of the signs, he suddenly rose up on his feet, and cried out

the other provinces pertaining to Rome.

plucked up his race by the roots, men did not think it meet for
him to triumph so for the calamities of his country, rejoicing at
a thing for the which he had but one excuse to allege in his
defence unto the gods and men, that he was compelled to do
that he did. And the rather they thought it not meet, because
he had never before sent letters nor messengers unto the

<note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Caesar Dictator perpetual.</note>This was a plain tyranny: for to this absolute power of
Dictator, they added this, never to be afraid to be deposed.
Cicero pronounced before the Senate, that they should give him
such honours as were meet for amen: howbeit others afterwards
added too honours beyond all reason. For men striving who
should most honour him, they made him hateful and troublesome
to themselves that most favoured him, by reason of the unmeasurable
greatness and honours which they gave him. Thereupon
it is reported, that even they that most hated him were no
less favourers and furtherers of his honours than they that most

                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">pretext.</note>
to attempt that they did against him. And now for himself, after
he had ended his civil wars, he did so honourably behave himself,
that there was no fault to be found in him: and therefore
methinks, amongst other honours they gave him, he rightly deserved
this, that <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">The temple of clemency dedicated unto Caesar, for his coutesy.</note>they should build him a temple of Clemency, to
thank him for his courtesy he had used unto them in his victory.
For he pardoned many of them that had borne arms against
him, and furthermore, did prefer some of them to honour and
office in the commonwealth: as, amongst others, <note type="sum" resp="trans" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">Cassius and Brutus Praetors.</note>Cassius and
Brutus, both the which were made Praetors. And, where Pompey's
images had been thrown down, he caused them to be set
up again: whereupon Cicero said then, that, Caesar setting up
Pompey's images again, he made his own to stand the surer.
And when some of his friends did counsel him to have a guard
for the safety of his person, and some also did offer themselves
to serve him, he would never consent to it, but said: <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Caesar;s saying of death.</note>"It was

<note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Goodwill of subjects, the best guard and safety for princes.</note>win himself the love and goodwill of the people, as the honourablest
guard and best safety he could have, he made common
feasts again and general distributions of corn. Furthermore, to
gratify the soldiers also, he replenished many cities again with
inhabitants, which before had been destroyed, and placed them
there that had no place to repair unto: of the which the noblest
<pb n="93"/>

and chiefest cities were these two, Carthage and Corinth: and
it chanced also, that like as aforetime they had been both taken
and destroyed together, even so were they both set on foot again,
and replenished with people, at one

them Praetors and Consuls in time to come; and unto others
honours and preferments: but to all men generally good hope,
seeking all the ways he could to make every man contented
with his reign. Insomuch as one of his Consuls called Maximus,
chancing to die a day before his consulship ended, he
<note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Caninius Rebilius consul for one day.</note>declared Caninius Rebilius Consul only for the day that remained.
So, divers going to his house (as the manner was) to salute him,
and to congratulate with him of his calling and preferment,
being newly chosen officer, Cicero pleasantly said: "Come, let
us make haste, and be gone thither before his consulship 
<term>come out</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">come to an end.</note>." Furthermore, Caesar being born to attempt all great
enterprises, and having an ambitious desire besides to covet
great honours, the prosperous good success he had of his former
conquests bred no desire in him quietly to enjoy the fruits of his
labours; but rather gave him the hope of things to come, still
kindling more and more in him thoughts of greater enterprises
and desire of new glory, as if that which he had present were
stale and nothing worth. This humour of his was no other but
an emulation with himself as with another man, and a certain
contention to overcome the things he prepared to attempt. For
he was determined, and made preparation also, to make war
with the Persians. Then, when he had overcome them, to pass
through Hyrcania (compassing in the sea Caspium, and mount
Caucasus) into the realm of Pontus, and so to invade Scythia:
and, overrunning all the countries and people adjoining unto
high Germany, and Germany itself, at length to return by Gaul
into Italy, and so to enlarge the Roman empire round, that it
might be every way compassed in with the great sea Oceanum.
But whilst he was preparing for this voyage, he attempted to cut
the bar of the 
<term>straight</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">strait, isthmus.</note> of Peloponnesus, in the market-place

the city of

                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">Circeii.</note>, with a deep channel and high banks cast
up on either side, and so to fall into the sea at Terracina, for
the better safety and commodity of the merchants that came to
Rome to traffic there. Furthermore, he determined to drain
and

                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">drain.</note> all the water of the

Nomentum and Setium, to make firm land, for the benefit of

take away all other impediments that made the

meet to harbour such ships as did continually traffic thither.
All these things were purposed to be done, but took no effect.

the year, to take away all confusion of time, being exactly calculated

great commodity unto all men. For the Romans, using then the
ancient computation of the year, had not only such uncertainty
and alteration of the month and times, that the sacrifices and
yearly feasts came, by little and little, to seasons contrary for
the purpose they were ordained: but also, in the revolution of
the sun (which is called Annus Solaris) no other nation agreed
with them in account: and, of the Romans themselves, only
the priests understood it. And therefore when they 
<term>listed</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">pleased.</note>, they
suddenly (no man being able to control them) did thrust in a

                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">Mercedonius mensis intercalaris.</note>. Some say that Numa Pompilius was the

                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">arrange.</note> them to

and best expert mathematicians at that time, did set
forth an excellent and perfect calendar, more exactly calculated
than any other that was before: the which the Romans do use
until this present day, and 
<term>do nothing</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">in no way.</note> err as others in the
difference of time. But his enemies notwithstanding, that envied
his greatness, did not stick to find fault withal. As Cicero the
orator, when one said, "to-morrow the star Lyra will rise :"
"Yea," said he, "at the commandment of Caesar;" as if men
were compelled so to say and think by Caesar's edict. <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Why Caesar was hated.</note>
                  <milestone n="60" unit="para"/>But the
chiefest cause that made him mortally hated was the covetous
desire he had to be called king: which first gave the people
just cause, and next his secret enemies honest 
<term>colour</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">good reason.</note>, to
bear him ill-will. This notwithstanding, they that procured
him this honour and dignity gave it out among the people that
it was written in the Sybilline prophecies, 'how the Romans
might overcome the Parthians, if they made war with them and
<pb n="95"/>

were led by a king, but otherwise that they were unconquerable.'
And furthermore they were so bold besides, that, Caesar returning
to Rome from the city of Alba, when they came to salute
him, they called him king. But the people being offended, and
Caesar also angry, he said he was not called king, but Caesar.
Then every man keeping silence, he went his way heavy and
sorrowful. When they had decreed divers honours for him in
the Senate, the Consuls and Praetors, accompanied with the
whole assembly of the Senate, went unto him in the marketplace,
where he was set by the pulpit for orations, to tell him
what honours they had decreed for him in his absence. But he,
sitting still in his majesty, disdaining to rise up unto them when
they came in, as if they had been private men, answered them:
'that his honours had more need to be cut off than enlarged.'
This did not only offend the Senate but the common people also,
to see that he should so lightly esteem of the magistrates of the
commonwealth: insomuch as every man that might lawfully
go his way departed thence very sorrowfully. Thereupon also
Caesar rising departed home to his house, and tearing open his
doublet-collar, making his neck bare, he cried out aloud to his
friends, 'that his throat was ready to offer to any man that
would come and cut it.' Notwithstanding it is reported, that
afterwards, to excuse his folly, he imputed it to his disease,
saying, 'that their wits are not 
<term>perfit</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">perfect.</note> which have this disease of
the

common people, but are soon troubled with a trembling of their
body, and a sudden dimness and giddiness.' But that was not
true, for he would have risen up to the Senate, but Cornelius
Balbus one of his friends (or rather a flatterer) would not let
him, saying: "What, do you not remember that you are
Caesar, and will you not let them reverence you and do their
duties?"

the which in old time men say was the feast of shepherds or
herdmen, and is much like unto the feast of the Lycaens in
Arcadia. But howsoever it is, that day there are divers noblemen's
sons, young men, (and some of them magistrates themselves
that govern then), which run naked through the city,
striking in sport them they meet in their way with leather
thongs, hair and all on, to make them 
<term>give place</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">draw back.</note>. And many,

their way, and do put forth their hands to be stricken, as scholars
hold them out to their schoolmaster to be stricken with the

have good delivery; and so, being barren, that it will make them
to conceive with child. Caesar sat to behold that sport upon
the pulpit for orations, in a chain of gold, apparelled in triumphant
manner. <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Antonius, being Consul, was one of the Lupercalians.</note>Antonius, who was Consul at that time, was
one of them that ran this holy course. So when he came into
the market-place, the people made a lane for him to run at
liberty, and he came to Caesar, and <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Antonius presented the diadem to Caesar.</note>presented him a diadem
wreathed about with laurel. Whereupon there rose a certain
cry of rejoicing, not very great, done only by a few appointed
for the purpose. But when Caesar refused the diadem, then all
the people together made an outcry of joy. Then Antonius
offering it him again, there was a second shout of joy, but yet of
a few. But when Caesar refused it again the second time, then
all the whole people shouted. Caesar having made this proof,
found that the people did not like of it, and thereupon rose out
of his chair, and commanded the crown to be earned unto
Jupiter in the Capitol. After that, there were set up images of
Caesar in the city, with diadems upon their heads like kings.
Those the two tribunes, Flavius and Marullus, went and
pulled down, and furthermore, meeting with them that first saluted
Caesar as king, they committed them to prison. The people
followed them rejoicing at it, and called them Brutes, because
of Brutus, who had in old time driven the kings out of Rome,
and that brought the kingdom of one person unto government
of the Senate and people. Caesar was so offended withal,
that he deprived Marullus and Flavius of their tribuneships,
and accusing them, he spake also against the people, and called
them Bruti and Cumani, to wit, beasts and fools.

obtained it before Cassius, who likewise made suit for the
same: and Caesar also, as it is reported, said in this contention,

clapping his hand on his body, told them, "Brutus will look for

to rule after him, but yet that, for ambition's sake, he would not
shew himself unthankful or dishonourable. Now they that
desired change, and wished Brutus only their prince and governor

cast sundry papers into the Praetor's seat, where he gave audience,

in fire: and furthermore, that there was a slave of the soldiers
that did cast a marvellous burning flame out of his hand, insomuch
as they that saw it thought he had been burnt; but when
the fire was out, it was found he had no hurt. Caesar

                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">himself.</note> also
<pb n="98"/>
doing sacrifice unto the gods, found that one of the beasts
which was sacrificed had no heart: and that was a strange thing
in nature, how a beast could live without a heart. Furthermore
there was a certain <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Caesar's day of his death prognosticated by a soothsayer.</note>soothsayer that had given Caesar warning
long time afore, to take heed of the day of the Ides of March,
(which is the fifteenth of the month), for on that day he should
be in great danger. That day being come, Caesar going unto
the Senate-house, and speaking merrily unto the soothsayer,
told him, "the Ides of March be come :" " so they be," softly
answered the soothsayer, " but yet are they not past." And the
very day before, Caesar, supping with Marcus Lepidus, sealed
certain letters, as he was wont to do, at the board: so, talk falling
out amongst them, reasoning what death was best, he, 
<term>preventing</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">anticipating.</note>
their opinions, cried out aloud, " death unlooked for."
Then going to bed the same night, as his manner was, and
lying with his wife Calpurnia, all the windows and doors of his

afraid when he saw such light: but more, when he heard his
wife Calpurnia, being fast asleep, weep and sigh, and put forth
many 
<term>fumbling</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">rambling.</note> lamentable speeches: for <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">The dream of Calpurnia, Caesar's wife.</note>she dreamed that
Caesar was slain, and that she had him in her arms. Others
also do deny that she had any such dream, as, amongst other,

she saw it broken down, and that she thought she lamented
and wept for it. Insomuch that, Caesar rising in the morning,
she prayed him, if it were possible, not to go out of the doors
that day, but to adjourn the session of the Senate until another
day. And if that he made no reckoning of her dream, yet that
he would search further of the soothsayers by their sacrifices,
to know what should happen him that day. Thereby it seemed
that Caesar likewise did fear or suspect somewhat, because his
wife Calpurnia until that time was never given to any fear and
superstition: and that then he saw her so troubled in mind
with this dream she had. But much more afterwards, when the
soothsayers having sacrificed many beasts one after another,
told him that none did

and yet was of the conspiracy with Cassius and Brutus: he,
fearing that if Caesar did adjourn the session that day, the conspiracy
would be betrayed, laughed at the soothsayers, and
reproved Caesar, saying, " that he gave the Senate occasion to
mislike with him, and that they might think he mocked them,
considering that by his commandment they were assembled,
and that they were ready willingly to grant him all things, and
to proclaim him king of all his provinces of the Empire of
Rome out of Italy, and that he should wear his diadem in all

and that quickly, for they be matters of great weight, and
touch you nearly." Caesar took it of him, but could never read
it, though he many times attempted it, for the number of people
that did salute him: but holding it still in his hand, keeping
it to himself, went on withal into the Senate-house. Howbeit
others are of opinion, that it was some man else that gave him
that memorial, and not Artemidorus, who did what he could

                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">murder.</note> was prepared,
and where the Senate were assembled, and where also
there stood up an image of Pompey dedicated by himself
amongst other ornaments which he gave unto the theatre, all
these were manifest proofs, that it was the ordinance of some
god that made this treason to be executed, specially in that
very place. It is also reported, that Cassius (though otherwise
he did favour the doctrine of Epicurus) beholding the image of
Pompey, before they entered into the action of their traitorous
enterprise, he did softly call upon it to aid him: but the instant
danger of the present time, taking away his former reason,
did suddenly put him into a furious passion, and made him
like a man half

faithful friend to Caesar, and a valiant man besides of his hands,
him Decius Brutus Albinus entertained out of the Senate-house,
having begun a long tale of set purpose. So Caesar coming
into the house, all the Senate stood up on their feet to do him
honour. Then part of Brutus' company and confederates stood
round about Caesar's chair, and part of them also came towards
him, as though they made suit with Metellus Cimber, to call
home his brother again from banishment: and thus prosecuting
still their suit, they followed Caesar till he was set in his chair.
Who denying their petitions, and being offended with them
one after another, because the more they were denied the more
they pressed upon him and were the earnester with him, Metellus
at length, taking his gown with both his hands, pulled it
over his neck, which was the sign given the confederates to
set upon him. <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Casca the first that struck at Caesar.</note>Then Casca, behind him,

                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">struck.</note> him in the
neck with his sword; howbeit the wound was not great nor
mortal, because it seemed the fear of such a devilish attempt
did amaze him and take his strength from him, that he killed
him not at the first blow. But Caesar, turning straight unto
him, caught hold of his sword and held it hard; and they both
cried out, Caesar in Latin: " O vile traitor Casca, what doest
thou?" and Casca, in Greek, to his brother: "Brother, help
me." At the beginning of this stir, they that were present, not
knowing of the conspiracy, were so amazed with the horrible
sight they saw, they had no power to fly, neither to help him,
nor so much as once to make an outcry. They on the other side
that had conspired his death compassed him in on every side with
<pb n="101"/>

their swords drawn in their hands, that Caesar turned him no where
but he was stricken at by some, and still had naked swords in
his face, and was 
<term>hackled</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">hacked.</note> and mangled among them, as a wild

every man should give him a wound, because all their parts
should be in this 
<term>murther</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">murder.</note>: and then Brutus himself gave him
one wound about his privities. Men report also, that Caesar
did still defend himself against the rest, running every way with
his body: but when he saw Brutus with his sword drawn in his
hand, then he pulled his gown over his head, and made no more
resistance, and was driven either casually or 
<term>purposedly</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">purposely.</note>, by the

Pompey's enemy, being thrown down on the ground at his feet,
and yielding up the ghost there, for the number of wounds he had
upon him. For it is reported, <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Caesar slain, and had 23 wounds upon him.</note>that he had three and twenty
wounds upon his body: and divers of the conspirators did hurt
themselves, striking one body with so many blows.

ordained besides, <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Caesar's funerals.</note>that Caesar's funerals should be honoured as

that he feared his dream, and had an ague on him

ready to pass over his army from the city of Abydos to the
other coast lying directly against it, slept every night (as his
manner was) in his tent; and being yet awake, thinking of his
affairs (for by report he was as careful a captain and lived with
as little sleep as ever man did) he thought he heard a noise at
his tent-door, and looking towards the light of the lamp that
waxed very dim, <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">A spirit appeared unto Brutus.</note>he saw a horrible vision of a man, of a wonderful
greatness and dreadful look, which at the first made him marvellously

him what he was. The image answered him: "I am thy ill
angel, Brutus, and thou shalt see me by the city of Philippes."
Then Brutus replied again, and said, "Well, I shall see thee
then." Therewithal the spirit 
<term>presently</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">at once.</note> vanished from him.
After that time Brutus, being in battle near unto the city of

battle he

knowing that he should die, did put himself to all hazard in
battle, but yet fighting could not be slain. So seeing his men
put to flight and overthrown, he ran unto a little rock not
far off, and there setting his sword's point to his breast, fell
upon it and slew himself; but yet, as it is reported, with the
help of his friend that despatched him.</p>

the ancient Romans made his statue of brass to be set up in the
Capitol, with the images of the kings, holding a naked sword in
his hand: because he had valiantly put down the Tarquins from
the kingdom of Rome. <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Brutus' manners.</note>But that Junius Brutus, being of a sour
stern nature not softened by reason, being like unto swordblades of too hard a temper, was so subject to his choler and
malice he bare unto the tyrants, that for their sakes he caused
his own sons to be executed. But this Marcus Brutus in contrary manner, whose life we presently write, having framed his
manners of life by the rules of virtue and study of philosophy,
and having employed his wit, which was gentle and constant, in
<pb n="106"/>
 attempting of great things, me thinks he was rightly made and
framed unto virtue. So that his very enemies which wish him
most hurt, because of his conspiracy against Julius Caesar, if
there were any noble attempt done in all this conspiracy, they
refer it wholly unto Brutus; and all the cruel and violent acts
unto Cassius, who was Brutus' familiar friend, but not so well

close under his arm, and went into the market-place. When he
was come thither, he made as though he had somewhat to say
unto him, and pressed as near him as he could: wherefore
Melius stooping down with his head to hear what he would say,
Servilius stabbed him in with his dagger and slew him. Thus
much all writers agree <term>for</term>

some, for the evil will and malice they bare unto Brutus, because
of the death of Julius Caesar, do maintain, that he came not of
Junius Brutus that drave out the Tarquins: for there were none
left of his race, considering that his two sons were executed for
conspiracy with the Tarquins; and that Marcus Brutus came of
a mean house, the which was raised to honour and office in the
common-wealth but of late time. Posidonius the Philosopher
writeth the contrary, that Junius Brutus indeed slew two of his
sons which were men grown, as the histories do declare; howbeit that there was a third son, being but a little child at that
time, from whom the house and family afterwards was derived:
and furthermore, that there were in his time certain famous men
of that family, whose stature and countenance resembled much
the image of Junius Brutus. <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Servilia, Cato's sister.</note>And thus much for this matter:


<milestone n="2" unit="para"/>Marcus Cato the philosopher was brother unto Servilia, Marcus

altogether to the old Academy. <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Brutus followed the old Academics.</note>Therefore he did ever greatly

in this sort: "I understand you have given Dolabella money:
if you have done it willingly, you confess you have offended
me; if against your wills, shew it then by giving me willingly."

choose the judgment of the Patareians, or the fortune of the
Xanthians." These were Brutus' manner of letters, which were
honoured for their briefness.

goods. But Cato, fearing he would be light-fingered, wrote unto
Brutus forthwith to come out of Pamphilia (where he was but
newly recovered of a sickness) into Cyprus; the which he did.
The which journey he was sorry to take upon him both for respect of Caninius' shame, whom Cato (as he thought) wrongfully
slandered: as also because he thought this office too mean and
unmeet for him, being a young man, and given to his book.
This notwithstanding, he behaved himself so honestly and carefully, that Cato did greatly commend him: and after all the
goods were sold and converted into ready money, he took the
most part of it, and returned withal to Rome.

because Pompey not long before had put his father to death. <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Brutus taketh part with Pompey.</note>But
Brutus, preferring the respect of his country and commonwealth
before private affection, and persuading himself that Pompey

governor of that province. But when he saw that there was no
way to rise, nor to do any noble exploits, and that Caesar and
Pompey were both camped together, and fought for victory: he
went of himself, unsent for, into Macedon, to be partaker of the
danger. It is reported that Pompey, being glad, and wondering
at his coming, when he saw him come to him, he rose out of his
chair, and went and embraced him before them all, and used him
as honorably as he could have done the noblest man that took
his part. <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Brutus studied in Pompey's camp.</note>Brutus, being in Pompey's camp, did nothing but study
all day long, except he were with Pompey; and not only the

                  <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Julius Caesar loved Servilia, Brutus' mother.</note>It is reported that Caesar did not forget him, and that he

unto them, that then they should bring him unto him: but if he
resisted and would not be taken, then that they should let him
go, and do him no hurt. Some say he did this for Servilia's
sake, Brutus' mother. For when he was a young man, he had
been acquainted with Servilia, who was extremely in love with
him. And because Brutus was born in that time when their
love was hottest, he persuaded himself that he begat him. For
proof hereof the report goeth, that when the weightiest matters
were in hand in the Senate, about the conspiracy of Catiline,
which was likely to have undone the city of Rome, Caesar and
Cato sat near together, and were both of contrary minds to each

other: and then, that in the mean time one delivered Caesar a
letter. Caesar took it, and read it softly to himself: but Cato
cried out upon Caesar, and said he did not well to receive advertisements from enemies: whereupon the whole Senate began
to murmur at it. Then Caesar gave Cato the letter as it was sent
him, who read it, and found that it was a love-letter sent from
his sister Servilia: thereupon he cast it again to Caesar, and said
unto him; ''<term>Hold</term>

bare unto Caesar. <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Brutus saved by Julius Caesar after the battle of Pharsalia.</note>

                  <milestone n="6" unit="para"/>So, after Pompey's overthrow at the battle of
Pharsalia, and that he fled to the sea, when Caesar came to besiege his camp, Brutus went out of the camp-gates unseen of any

                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">marsh.</note> full of water and reeds. Then
when night was come, he crept out, and went unto the city of

that he had <term>scaped</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">escaped.</note>, and sent for him to come unto him. When
Brutus was come, he did not only pardon him, but also kept him
always about him, and did as much honour and esteem him as
any man he had in his company. Now no man could tell
whither Pompey was fled, and all were marvellous desirous to
know it: wherefore Caesar walking a good way alone with Brutus,
he did ask him which way he thought Pompey took. Caesar
perceiving by his talk that Brutus guessed certainly whither
Pompey should be fled, he left all other ways, and took his
journey directly towards Egypt. Pompey (as Brutus had conjectured) was indeed fled into Egypt, but there he was villanously slain. Furthermore, Brutus obtained pardon of Caesar
for Cassius; and defending <term>also the king</term>

was overlaid with a world of accusations against him; howbeit,
intreating for him, he saved him the best part of his realm and
kingdom. They say also that Caesar said, when he heard
Brutus plead: "I know not," said he, "what this young man
would; but what he would, he willeth it vehemently." For as
Brutus' gravity and constant mind would not grant all men their
requests that sued unto him, but, being moved with reason and
discretion, did always incline to that which was good and honest:
even so, when it was moved to follow any matter, he used a kind
of forcible and vehement persuasion, that calmed not till he had
obtained his desire. For by flattering of him a man could
never obtain any thing at his hands, nor make him to do that
which was unjust. Further, he thought it not meet for a man of
<pb n="110"/>
calling and estimation, to yield unto the requests and entreaties
of a shameless and importunate suitor, requesting things unmeet:
the which notwithstanding some men do for shame, because they
dare deny nothing: and therefore he was wont to say, "That he
thought them evil brought up in their youth, that could deny
nothing."

good name contended against many noble exploits in arms,
which Cassius had done against the Parthians. So Caesar after
he had heard both their objections, told his friends, with whom
he consulted about this matter: "Cassius' cause is the juster,"
said he, "but Brutus must be first preferred." Thus Brutus had
the first Praetorship, and Cassius the second: who thanked not
Caesar so much for the Praetorship he had, as he was angry with
him for that he had lost. But Brutus in many other things
tasted of the benefit of Cesar's favour in any thing he requested.
For if he had <term>listed</term>

have been the chiefest man of Rome, if he could have contented
himself for a time to have been next unto Caesar, and to have

brake their cages where they were tied up and turned them loose,
thinking they would have done great mischief to the enemies,

did. For under the image of his ancestor Junius Brutus, (that
crave the kings out of Rome) they wrote: "O, that it pleased
the gods thou wert now alive, Brutus!" and again, "that 
thou
wert here among us now!" His tribunal or chair, where he
gave audience during the time he was Praetor, was full of such
bills4: "Brutus, thou art asleep, and art not Brutus indeed."
And of all this Caesar's flatterers were the cause: who, beside
many other exceeding and unspeakable honours they daily devised for him, in the night-time they put diadems upon the
heads of his images, supposing thereby to allure the common
people to call him King, instead of Dictator. Howbeit it turned
to the contrary, as we have written more at large in Julius
Caesar's life.

heard say that Caesar's friends should move the council that day,
that Caesar should be called king by the Senate. Brutus 
answered him, he would not be there. "But if we be sent for,"
said Cassius, "how then?" "For myself then," said Brutus, "I 
mean not to hold my peace, but to withstand it, and rather die
than lose my liberty." Cassius being bold, and taking hold of
this word: "Why," quoth he, "what Roman is he alive that
will suffer thee to die for thy liberty? What? knowest thou not
that thou art Brutus? Thinkest thou that they be cobblers, tapsters, or suchlike base <term>mechanical</term>

it.

specially required hot and earnest execution), seeking by persuasion to bring all things to such safety, as there should be no
peril. <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Civil war worse than tyrannical government.</note>Brutus also did let other of his friends alone, as Statilius
Epicurian, and Faonius, that made profession to follow Marcus
Cato: because that, having cast out words afar off, disputing together in philosophy to feel their minds, Faonius answered,
'that civil war was worse than tyrannical government usurped
against the law.' And Statilius told him also, 'that it were an
unwise part for him to put his life in danger, for a sort of ignorant fools and asses.' Labeo was present at this talk and maintained the contrary against them both. But Brutus held his
peace, as though it had been a doubtful matter, and a hard thing
to have been decided. But afterwards, being out of their company, he made Labeo privy to his intent; who very readily
offered himself to make one. And they thought good also to
bring in another Brutus to join with him, surnamed Albinus:

to bring good force of a great number of slaves, and fencers at

Cassius and Labeo told Brutus Albinus of it at the first, but
he made them no answer. But when he had spoken with
Brutus himself alone, and that Brutus had told him he was
the chief ringleader of all this conspiracy, then he willingly
promised him the best aid he could. <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">The wonderful faith and secrecy of the conspirators of Caesar's death.</note>Furthermore, the <term>only</term>

taken oaths together, nor taken or given any caution or assurance, nor binding themselves one to another by any religious

could so cunningly handle it, that notwithstanding the gods

                  <milestone n="10" ed="Skeat" unit="chapter"/> Now a day being appointed for the meeting of the
Senate, at what time they hoped Caesar would not fail to come,
the conspirators determined then to put their enterprise in
execution, because they might meet safely at that time without suspicion; and the rather, for that all the noblest and chiefest men of the city would be there: who, when they should see
such a great matter executed, would every man <term>set to</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">affix.</note> their
hands, for the defence of their liberty. Furthermore they
thought also, that the appointment of the place where the council should be kept was chosen of <term>purpose</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">on purpose.</note> by divine providence,
and made all for them. For it was one of the porches about the
theatre, in the which there was a certain place full of seats for
men to sit in; where also was set up the image of Pompey,
which the city had made and consecrated in honour of 
him,
when he did beautify that part of the city with the theatre
he built, with divers porches about it. In this place was the
assembly of the Senate appointed to be, just on the fifteenth
day of the month IvIarch, which the Romans call 
<name>Idus Martias</name>:
so that it seemed some god of <term>purpose</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">on purpose.</note>had brought Caesar
thither to be slain, for revenge of Pompey's death. So when the
day was come, Brutus went out of his house with a dagger by
his side under his long gown, that nobody saw nor knew but
his wife only. The other conspirators were all assembled at
Cassius' house, to bring his son into the market-place, who on
that day did put on the man's gown, called <name>toga virilis;</name> and
from thence they came all in a troop together unto Pompey's

here is to be noted the wonderful assured constancy of these
conspirators, in so dangerous and weighty an enterprise as they
had undertaken. For many of them being praetors, by reason
of their office (whose duty is to minister justice to everybody)
did not only with great quietness and courtesy hear them that
spake unto them, or that pleaded matters before them, and gave
them attentive ear as if they had no other matter in their heads:
<pb n="117"/>

but moreover they gave just sentence, and carefully despatched
the causes before them. So there was one among them, who,
being condemned in a certain sum of money, refused to pay it,
and cried out that he did appeal unto Caesar. Then Brutus,
casting his eyes upon the conspirators, said: "Caesar shall not
<term>let</term>

                  <milestone n="15" unit="para"/>Notwithstanding this, by
chance there fell out many misfortunes unto them, which was
enough to have marred the enterprise. The first and chiefest
was Caesar's long tarrying, who came very late to the Senate:
for, because the signs of the sacrifices appeared unlucky, his
wife Calphurnia kept him at home, and the soothsayers bade
him beware he went not abroad. The second cause was, when
one came unto Casca being a conspirator, and taking him by
the hand, said unto him: " O Casca? thou keptest it close from
me, but Brutus hath told me all." Casca being amazed at it,
the other went on with his tale, and said: " Why, how now, how
cometh it to pass thou art thus rich, that thou dost sue to be
Aedilis?" Thus Casca being deceived by the other's doubtful
words, he told them it was a thousand to one, he blabbed not
out all the conspiracy. Another Senator, called Popilius Laena,
after he had saluted Brutus and Cassius more friendly than he
was wont to do, he <term>rounded</term>

litter: for he determined not to stay in the Senate all that day
(because he was afraid of the unlucky signs of the sacrifices)
but to adjourn matters of importance unto the next session and
council holden, feigning himself not to be well at ease. When
Caesar came out of his litter, Popilius Laena (that had talked
before with Brutus and Cassius, and had prayed the gods they
might bring this enterprise to pass) went unto Caesar, and kept
him a long time with a talk. Caesar gave good ear unto him:
wherefore the conspirators (if so they should be called) not
hearing what he said to Caesar, but conjecturing by that he had
told them a little before that his talk was none other but the
very discovery of their conspiracy, they were afraid every man
of them; and, one looking in another's face, it was easy to see
that they all were of a mind, that it was no tarrying for them
till they were apprehended, but rather that they should kill
themselves with their own hands. <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Brutus with his countenance encouraged his fearful consorts.</note>And when Cassius and certain

Laena, and considering that he did use himself rather like an

to his companion (because there were many amongst them that
were not of the conspiracy), but with a pleasant countenance
encouraged Cassius. And immediately afier Laena vent from
Caesar, and kissed his hand; which shewed plainly that it was
for some matter concerning himself that he had held him so
long in talk.

<milestone n="17" unit="para"/>Now all the Senators being entered first into this
place or chapter-house where the council should be kept, all the
other conspirators straight stood about Caesar's chair, as if they
had had something to say unto him. And some say that Cassius,

and amongst them they presented one <term>Tullius Cimber</term>
                  <note resp="trans" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">In Caesar's life he is called Metellus Cimber.</note> who
made humble suit for the calling home again of his brother that

he violently thrust them from him. <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">The murder of Caesar.  Casca the first that wounded him.</note>Then Cimber with both his

and cried out in Latin: "O traitor Casca, what dost thou?"
Casca on the other side cried in Greek, and called his brother
to help him. So divers running on a heap together to fly upon
Caesar, he, looking about him to have fled, saw Brutus with a
sword drawn in his hand ready to strike at him: then he let
Casca's hand go, and casting his gown over his face, suffered
every man to strike at him that would. Then the conspirators
thronging one upon another, because every man was desirous to 
have a cut at him, so many swords and daggers lighting upon

because he was a wicked man, and that in nature favoured
tyranny: besides also, for that he was in great estimation with
soldiers, having been conversant of long time amongst them:
and especially having a mind bent to great enterprises, he was
also of great authority at that time, being Consul with Caesar.
But Brutus would not agree to it. <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Why Antonius was not slain with Caesar.</note>First, for that he said it was

indeed did the more increase the fear and tumult. But when
they saw they slew no man, neither did spoil or make havoc of
anything, then certain of the Senators and many of the people,
emboldening themselves, went to the Capitol unto them.

<milestone n="14" ed="Skeat" unit="chapter"/>  There, a great number of men being assembled together
one after another, Brutus made an oration unto them, to win
the favour of the people, and to justify that they had done. All
those that were by said they had done well, and cried unto
them that they should boldly come down from the Capitol:
whereupon Brutus and his companions came boldly down into
the market-place. The rest followed in <term>troupe</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">a troup</note>, but Brutus went
foremost, very honourably compassed in round about with the
noblest men of the city, which brought him from the Capitol,
through the market-place, to the pulpit for orations. When the
people saw him in the pulpit, although they were a multitude of
<term>rakehels</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">turbulent men.</note> of all sorts, and had a good will to make some stir;
yet, being ashamed to do it, for the reverence they bare unto
Brutus, they kept silence to hear what he would say. When
Brutus began to speak, they gave him quiet audience: howbeit.
immediately after, they shewed that they were not all contented
with the murtherl. For when another, called Cinna, would have
spoken, and began to accuse Caesar, they fell into a great uproar
among them, and marvellously reviled him; insomuch that the
conspirators returned again into the Capitol. There Brutus,
being afraid to be besieged, sent back again the noblemen that
came thither with him, thinking it no reason that they, which
were no partakers of the <term>murther</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">murder.</note>, should be partakers of the

<milestone n="19" unit="para"/>Then the next morning, the Senate being assembled,
and holden within the temple of the goddess Tellus, to wit, the
Earth: and Antonius, Plancus, and Cicero, having made a
motion to the Senate in that assembly that they should take an
order to pardon and forget all that was past, and to establish
friendship and peace again: it was decreed, that they should not
only be pardoned, but also that the Consuls should refer it to
the Senate, what honours should be appointed unto them. <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Honours decreed for the murderers of Caesar.</note>This

being agreed upon, the Senate brake up; and Antonius the
Consul, to put them in heart that were in the Capitol, sent them
his son for a pledge. Upon this assurance, Brutus and his companions came down from the Capitol, where every man saluted
and embraced each other; among the which Antonius himself
did <term>bid</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">invite</note> Cassius to supper to him, and Lepidus also bade Brutus;
and so one bade another, as they had friendship and acquaintance together.

they appointed them several governments of Provinces. For

Decius Brutus Albinus, Gaul on this side of the Alps. 

<milestone n="20" unit="para"/>When

and of his funerals and tomb. <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Caesar's will and funerals.</note>Then Antonius, thinking

went with the motion, and agreed unto it, wherein it seemeth
he committed a second fault. For the first fault he did, was
when he would not consent to his fellow-conspirators, that Antonius should be slain; and therefore he was justly accused,
that thereby he had saved and strengthened a strong and grievous enemy of their conspiracy. The second fault was, when he
agreed that Caesar's funerals should be as Antonius would have
them, the which indeed marred all. For first of all, when Caesar's
testament was openly read among them, whereby it appeared
that he bequeathed unto every citizen of Rome 75 drachmas a
man; and that he left his gardens and arbours unto the people,
which he had on this side of the river Tiber, in the place where
now the temple of Fortune is built: the people then loved him, and
were marvellous sorry for him. <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Antonius' funeral oration for Caesar.</note>Afterwards, when Caesar's body
was brought into the market-place, Antonius making his funeral
oration in praise of the dead, according to the ancient custom of
Rome, and perceiving that his words moved the common people

yearn the more; and taking Caesar's gown all bloody in his
hand, he laid it opento the sight of them all shewing what a

number of cuts and holes it had upon it. Therewithal the people
fell presently into such a rage and mutiny, that there was no more
order kept amongst the common people. For some of them
cried out, " Kill the murtherers :" others plucked up forms, tables,
and stalls about the market-place, as they had done before at
the funerals of Clodius, and having laid them all on a heap
together, they set them on fire, and thereupon did put the body
of Caesar, and burnt it in the <term>mids</term>

here, some there, took burning firebrands, and ran with them to

fell out another change and alteration, when the young man
Octavius Caesar came to Rome. He was the son of Julius Caesar's
niece, whom he had adopted for his son, and made his heir, by
his last will and testament. But when Julius Caesar, his adopted
father, was slain, he was in the city of Apollonia (where he
studied) tarrying for him, because he was detennined to make
war with the Parthians: but when he heard the news of his
death, he returned again to Rome. Where, to begin to curry
favour with the common people, he first of all took upon him his
adopted father's name, and made distribution among them of the
moneywhich his father had bequeathed unto them. By this means
he troubled Antonius sorely, and by force of money got a great
number of his father's soldiers together, that had served in the
wars with him. <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Brutus reproved Cicero for taking part with Octavius Caesar.</note>And Cicero himself, for the great malice he
bare Antonius, did favour his proceedings: but Brutus marvellously reproved him for it, and wrote unto him, that he seemed
by his doings not to be sorry to have a master, but only to be
afraid to have one that should hate him: and that all his doings
in the commonwealth did witness, that he chose to be subject to
a mild and courteous bondage, <term>sith</term>

abide to be subject to any masters, how gentle or mild soever
they were:" and, 'for his own part, that he had never resolutely
determined with himself to make war, or peace; but otherwise,
that he was certainly minded never to be slave nor subject.
And therefore he wondered much at him, how Cicero could be
afraid of the danger of civil wars, and would not be afraid of a
shameful peace: and that, to thrust Antonius out of the usurped
tyranny, in recompense he went <term>about</term>

Porcia seeing this picture, and likening herself to be in the same

Then Brutus smiling, answered again: "But yet," said he, "I
cannot for my part say unto Porcia, as Hector answered Andromache in the same place of the poet:

brought thereof into Macedon, Brutus, being then enforced to do
it, wrote unto Hortensius that he should put Caius Antonius to
death, to be revenged of the death of Cicero and of the other
Brutus, of the which the one was his friend, and the other a
kinsman. For this cause therefore Antonius afterwards, taking
Hortensius at the battle of Philippes, he made him to be slain
upon his brother's tomb. But when Brutus said that, he was
more ashamed of the cause for the which Cicero was slain than
he was otherwise sorry for his death; and that he could not but
greatly reprove his friends he had at Rome, who were slaves more
through their own fault than through their valiantness or manhood which usurped the tyranny: considering that they were so
cowardly and faint-hearted, as to suffer the sight of those things
before their eyes, the report whereof should only have grieved
them to the heart.

<milestone n="21" ed="Skeat" unit="chapter"/> Now when Brutus had passed over his army (that was
very great) into Asia, he gave order for the gathering of a great
number of ships together, as well in the coast of Bithynia, as also
in the city of Cyzicum, because he would have an army by sea;
and himself in the meantime went unto the cities, taking order
<term>for</term>

<pb n="129"/>
the country that had to do with him. Afterwards he sent
unto Cassius in Syria, to turn him from his journey into Egypt,
telling him that it was not for the conquest of any kingdom for
themselves that they wandered up and down in that sort, but
contrarily, that it was to restore their country again to her
liberty: and that the multitude of soldiers they gathered together was to subdue the tyrants that would keep them in
slavery and subjection. Wherefore, regarding their chief purpose and intent, they should not be far from Italy, as near as
they could possible, but should rather make all the haste they
could, to keep their countrymen. <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Brutus and Cassius do join armies together.</note>Cassius believed him, and
returned. Brutus went to meet him, and they both met at the
city of Smyrna, which was the first time that they saw together
since they took leave each of other at the haven of Piraea in
Athens, the one going into Syria, and the other into Macedon.
So they were marvellous joyful, and no less courageous, when
they saw the great armies together which they had both 
levied:
considering that they departed out of Italy like naked 
and poor
banished men, without armour and money, nor having any ship
ready nor soldier about them, nor any one town at their 
commandment; yet notwithstanding, in a short time after, they were
now met together, having ships, money, and soldiers enough,
both footmen and horsemen, to fight for the empire of Rome.

<milestone n="29" unit="para"/>
                  <milestone n="22" ed="Skeat" unit="chapter"/>  Now Cassius would have done Brutus much honour, as
Brutus did unto him, but Brutus most commonly <term>prevented</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">anticipated</note> him,
and went first unto him, both because he was the elder 
man as also for that he was sickly of body. <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">The sharp and cruel conditions of Cassius.</note>And men reputed him commonly to be very skilful in wars, but otherwise marvellous
choleric and cruel, who sought to rule men by fear rather than
with lenity: and on the other side, he was too familiar with
his friends, and would jest too broadly with them. <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Brutus' gentle and fair conditions.</note>But Brutus,
in contrary manner, for his virtue and valiantness, was well beloved of the people and his own, esteemed of noblemen, and
hated of no man, not so much as of his enemies; because he 
was a marvellous lowly and gentle person, noble-minded, and
would never be in any rage, nor carried away with pleasure
and covetousness, but had ever an upright mind with him,
and would never yield to any wrong or injustice; the which was 
the chiefest cause of his fame, of his rising, and of the goodwill
that every man bare him: for they were all persuaded that his
intent was good. <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Brutus' intent good, if he had overcome.</note>For they did not certainly believe that, if
Pompey himself had overcome Caesar, he would have resigned
<pb n="130"/>
his authority to the law, but rather they were of opinion that he
would still keep the sovereignty and absolute government in his
hands, taking only, to please the people, the title of Consul, or
Dictator, or of some other more civil office. And as for Cassius,
a hot, choleric, and cruel man, that would oftentimes be carried
away from justice for gain, it was certainly thought that he made
war and put himself into sundry dangers, more to have absolute
power and authority than to defend the liberty of his country.
For they that will also consider others that were elder men
than they, as Cinna, Marinus, and Carbo, it is out of doubt that
the end and hope of their victory was to be the lords of their
country, and in manner they did all confess that they fought for
the tyranny, and to be lords of the empire of Rome. And in
contrary manner, his enemies themselves did never reprove
Brutus for any such change or desire. <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Antonius' testimony of Brutus.</note>For it was said that
Antonius spake it openly divers times, that he thought, that
of all them that had slain Caesar, there was none but Brutus
only that was moved to do it, as thinking the act commendable of itself: but that all the other conspirators did conspire
his death for some private malice or envy, that they otherwise did bear unto him. Hereby it appeareth, that Brutus did
not trust so much to the power of his army as he did to his
own virtue, as it is to be seen by his writings. For approaching near to the <term>instant</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">imminent.</note> danger, he wrote unto Pomponius
Atticus that his affairs had the best hap that could be. "For,"
said he, "either I will set my country at liberty by battle, or by
honourable death rid me of this bondage." <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Brutus' noble mind to his country</note>And furthermore,
that they being certain and assured of all things else, this one
thing only was doubtful to them: whether they should live or
die with liberty. He wrote also that Antonius had his due payment for his folly: " for <term>where</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">whereas.</note>, he might have been a partner
equally of the glory of Brutus, Cassius, and Cato, and have made
one with them, he liked better to choose to be joined with Octavius Caesar alone: with whom, though now he be not overcome
by us, yet shall he shortly after also have war with him." <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Brutus a true prophet of Antonius.</note>. And
truly he proved a true prophet, for so came it indeed to pass.

<milestone n="30" unit="para"/>Now whilst Brutus and Cassius were together in the city of
Smyrna, Brutus prayed Cassius to let him have some part of his
money whereof he had great store; because all that he could rap
and <term>rend</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">obtain by any means.</note> of his side, he had bestowed it in making so great a
number of ships, that by means of them they should keep all the
sea at their commandment. Cassius' friends hindered this
<pb n="131"/>

request and earnestly dissuaded him from it, persuading him,
that it was no reason that Brutus should have the money which
Cassius had gotten together by sparing and levied with great
evil will of the people their subjects, for him to bestow liberally
upon his soldiers, and by this means to win their good wills, by
Cassius' <term>charge</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">at Cassius' expense</note>. This notwithstanding, Cassius gave him the
third part of this total sum. <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Cassius won the city of Rhodes.</note>So Cassius and Brutus then departing from each other, Cassius took the city of Rhodes, where
he too dishonestly and cruelly used himself: although, when he

<term>straights</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">straits, passes.</note> and little mountains, thinking by that means to stop
Brutus' passage. <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Brutus' gests in Lycia.</note>Wherefore Brutus sent his horsemen against
them, who stole upon them as they were at dinner, and 
slew
six hundred of them: and taking all the small towns and 
villages, he did get all the prisoners he took go without payment
of ransom, hoping by this his great courtesy to win them, to
draw all the rest of the country unto him. But they were so

                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">mutiny.</note> for every small
hurt they received as he passed by their country, and did despise his courtesy and good nature: until that at length he
went to besiege the city of the Xanthians, within the which
were shut up the cruellest and most warlike men of Lycia.
There was a river that ran by the walls of the city, in the
which many men saved themselves, swimming between two
waters, and fled: howbeit they laid nets overthwart the river,
and tied little bells on the top of them, to sound when any
man was taken in the nets. <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">The city of Xanthus set on fire.</note>The Xanthians made a sally out

                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">at once.</note> driven in again
by the Romans, so soon as they were discovered. The wind
by chance was marvellous big, and increased the flame so
sore, that it violently carried it into the <term>cranewes</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">crannies.</note> of the
wall of the city, that the <term>next</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">nearest.</note> houses unto them were straight
set on fire thereby. Wherefore Brutus being afraid that all
the city would take on <term>fire</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">take fire.</note>, he <term>presently</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">at once.</note> commanded his men
<pb n="132"/>
to quench the fire, and to save the town if it might be. 

<milestone n="31" unit="para"/>But
the Lycians at that instant fell into such a frenzy and strange
and horrible despair, that no man can well express it: and a
man cannot more rightly compare or liken it than to a frantic and most desperate desire to die. <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">The desperate end of the Xanthians.</note>For all of them together,
with their wives and children, masters and servants, and of all
sorts of age whatsoever, fought upon the <term>rampiers</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">ramparts.</note> of their
walls and did cast down stones and fire-works on the Romans,
which were very busy in quenching the flame of the fire, to
save the city. And in contrary manner also, they brought
faggots, dry wood, and reeds, to bring the fire further into the
city as much as might be, increasing it by such things as they
brought. Now when the fire had gotten into all parts of the
city, and that the flame burnt bright in every place, Brutus,
being sorry to see it, got upon his horse, and rode round about
the walls of the city, to see if it were possible for to save it,
and held up his hands to the inhabitants, praying them to
pardon their city, and to save themselves. Howbeit they would
not be persuaded, but did all that they could possible to cast
themselves away, not only men and women, but also little children. For some of them, weeping and crying out, did cast
themselves into the fire: others, headlong throwing themselves
down from the walls, brake their necks: others also made their
backs bare to the naked swords of their fathers, and undid
their clothes, praying them to kill them with their own hands.
After the city was burnt, they found a woman hanged up by
the neck, holding one of her children in her hand dead by
her, hanged up also, and in the other hand a burning torch
setting fire <term>on</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">to.</note> her house. Some would have had Brutus to
have seen her, but he would not see so horrible and tragical
a sight: but when he heard it, he fell a-weeping, and caused an
herald to make proclamation by sound of trumpet, that he
would give a certain sum of money to every soldier that could
save a Xanthian. So there were not (as it is reported) above
fifty of them saved, and yet they were saved against their wills.
Thus the Xanthians having ended the revolution of their fatal
destiny after a long continuance of time, they did through their
desperation renew the memory of the lamentable calamities of
their ancestors, who in like manner, in the wars of the Persians,
did burn their city, and destroyed themselves. 

<milestone n="32" unit="para"/>Therefore
Brutus, likewise besieging the city of the Patareians, perceiving
that they stoutly resisted him, he was also afraid of that, and
<pb n="133"/>

could not well tell whether he should give assault to it or not,
lest they would fall into the despair and desperation of the
Xanthians. Howbeit, having taken certain of their women
prisoners, he sent them back again without payment of ransom.
<note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">the Patareians do yield themselves unto Brutus.</note>Now they that were the wives and daughters of the noblest men
of the city, reporting unto their parents that they had found
Brutus a merciful, just, and courteous man, they persuaded them
to yield themselves and their city unto him, the which they did.
So after they had thus yielded themselves, divers other cities
also followed them, and did the like: and found Brutus more

done, but specially far above Cassius. <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">The extreme covetousness and cruelty of Cassius to the Rhodians.</note>For Cassius, about the

                  <milestone n="24" ed="Skeat" unit="chapter"/> Now Brutus, in all this journey, did many notable acts
and worthy of memory, both for rewarding, as also in punishing
those that had deserved it: wherefore, among the rest, I will tell
you of one thing, of the which he himself and all the noblemen
of the Romans were marvellous glad. When Pompey the Great
(having lost the battle against Julius Caesar, in the fields of
Pharsalia) came and fell upon the coast of Egypt, hard by the
city of Pelusium, those that were protectors to the young king
Ptolemy, being then but a child, sat in counsel with his servants
and friends, what they should determine in that case. They
were not all of one mind in this consultation: for some thought
it good to receive Pompey: others also, that they should drive
him out of Egypt. <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Theodotus, born in Chio, a rhetorician, schoolmaster to Ptolemy the young king of Egypt.</note>But there was a certain rhetorician called
Theodotus, that was born in the isle of Chio, who was the king's
schoolmaster to teach him rhetoric. He, being called to the
council for lack of sufficient men, said, "That both the one and
the other side went <term>awry</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">wrong.</note>, as well those that were of opinion to
receive Pompey as the other that would have had him driven
away: and that the best way was (considering the present time)
that they should lay hold on him, and kill him;" adding withal
this <term>sentence</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">proverb.</note>, "that a dead man biteth not." The whole council stuck to this opinion. So, for a notable example of incredible
<pb n="134"/>
misfortune, and unlooked-for unto Pompey, Pompey the
Great was slain by the motion and counsel of this wicked rhetorician Theodotus, as Theodotus afterwards did himself boast
of it. But when Julius Caesar came afterwards into Egypt, the
wicked men that consented to this counsel had their payment
according to their deserts: for they died every man of them a
wicked death, saving this Theodotus, whom fortune respited a
little while longer; and yet in that thne he lived a poor and
miserable life, never tarrying long in any one place. <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Theodotus Chian, the rhetorician that gave counsel to kill Pompey, was put to death by Brutus.</note>So Brutus

but was brought unto Brutus, where he suffered pains of death:

Cassius fell a-laughing at him: but Brutus thrust him out of the
chamber, and called him dog, and counterfeit Cynic. Howbeit
his coming in brake their strife at that thee, and so they left
each other. The self-same night Cassius prepared his supper in
his chamber, and Brutus brought his friends with him. So
when they were set at supper, Phaonius came to sit down after
he had washed. Brutus told him aloud, 'no man sent for him,'
and bad them set him at the upper end: meaning indeed, at the

very little, both for that his diet was moderate, as also because
he was continually occupied. He never slept in the day-time,
and in the night no longer than the time he was driven to be
alone, and when everybody else took their rest. But now whilst
he was in war, and his head ever busily occupied to think of his
affairs and what would happen, after he had slumbered a little
after supper, he spent all the rest of the night in dispatching of
his weightiest causes; and after he had taken order for them, if
he had any leisure left him, he would read some book till the
third watch of the night, at what time the captains, petty captains, and colonels, did use to come to him. <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">A spirit appeared unto Brutus in the city of Sardis.</note>So, being ready to
go into Europe, one night very late (when all the camp took
quiet rest) as he was in his tent with a little light, thinking of
weighty matters, he thought he heard one come in to him, and
casting his eye towards the door of his tent, that he saw a wonderful strange and monstrous shape of a body coming towards
him, and said never a word. So Brutus boldly asked what he
was, a god or a man, and what cause brought him thither ? The
spirit answered him, "I am thy evil spirit, Brutus: and thou
shalt see me by the city of <term>Philippes</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">Philippi</note>.'' Brutus being no otherwise afraid, replied again unto it: "Well, then I shall see thee
again." 

<milestone n="37" unit="para"/>The spirit <term>presently</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">thereupon</note>vanished away: and Brutus called
his men unto him, who told him that they heard no noise, nor
saw anything at all. Thereupon Brutus returned again to think
on his matters as he did before: and when the day brake, he
went unto Cassius, to tell him what vision had appeared unto
him in the night. <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Cassius' opinion of spirits after the Epicurean sect.</note>Cassius being in opinion an Epicurean, and
reasoning thereon with Brutus, spake to him touching the vision
thus." In our sect, Brutus, we have an opinion, that we do not
always feel or see that which we suppose we do both see and
feel, but that our senses being credulous and therefore easily
abused (when they are idle and unoccupied in their own objects)
are induced to imagine they see and conjecture that which in
truth they do not. For our mind is quick and cunning to work
(without either cause or matter) anything in the imagination
whatsoever. And therefore the imagination is resembled to clay,
and the mind to the potter: who, without any other cause than
his fancy and pleasure, changeth it into what fashion and form
he will. <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">The cause of dreams.</note>And this doth the diversity of our dreams shew unto
us. For our imagination doth upon a small fancy grow from

things imagined. For the mind of man is ever occupied, and
that continual moving is nothing but an imagination. But yet
there is a further cause of this in you. For you being by nature
given to melancholic discoursing, and of late continually occupied, your wits and senses, having been over-laboured, do easilier
yield to such imaginations. For, to say that there are spirits or
angels; and if there were, that they had the shape of men, or
such voices or any power at all to come unto us, it is a mockery.
And for mine own part, I would there were such, because that
we should not only have soldiers, horses, and ships, but also the
aid of the gods, to guide and further our honest and honourable
attempts." With these words Cassius did somewhat comfort
and quiet Brutus. <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">A wonderful sign by two eagles.</note>When they raised their camp, there came
two eagles that, flying with a marvellous force, lighted upon two
of the foremost ensigns, and always followed the soldiers, which
gave them meat and fed them, until they came near to the city
of Philippes: and there, one day only before the battle, they both
flew away.

people and nations of that country; but if there were any other
city or captain to overcome, then they made all clear before
them, and so drew towards the coasts of Thassos. There Norbanus, Iying in camp in a certain place called the <term>straights</term>

another place called Symbolon (which is a port in the sea),
Cassius and Brutus compassed him in in such sort, that he was
driven to forsake the place, which was of great strength for him,
and he was also in danger beside to have lost all his army. For
Octavius Caesar could not follow him because of his sickness,
and therefore stayed behind: whereupon they had taken his
army, had not Antonius' aid been, which made such wonderful
speed, that Brutus could <term>scant</term>

called the valley between both camps, the Philippian fields: and
there were never seen two so great armies of the Romans, one
before the other, ready to fight. In truth, Brutus' army was inferior to Octavius Caesar's in number of men; but for bravery
and rich <term>furniture</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">equipment.</note>, Brutus' army far excelled Caesar's. For the
most part of their armours were silver and gilt, which Brutus
had bountifully given them: although, in all other things, he
taught his captains to live in order without excess. <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Brutus' opinion for the bravery of soldiers in their armour and weapons.</note>But for the

it was an encouragement unto them that by nature are greedy
of honour, and that it maketh them also fight like devils that
love to get, and to be afraid to lose: because they fight to keep
their armour and weapon, as also their goods and lands. 

<milestone n="39" unit="para"/>Now
when they came to muster their armies, Octavius Caesar took
the muster of his army within the trenches of his camp, and
gave his men only a little corn, and five silver drachmas to
every man to sacrifice to the gods, and to pray for victory. But
Brutus, scorning this misery and niggardliness, first of all mustered his army, and did purify it in the fields, according to the
manner of the Romans: and then he gave unto every band a
number of wethers to sacrifice, and fifty silver drachmas to
every soldier. So that Brutus' and Cassius' soldiers were better
pleased, and more courageously bent to fight at the day of
battle, than their enemies' soldiers were. <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Unlucky signs unto Cassius.</note>Notwithstanding,
being busily occupied about the ceremonies of this purification,
it is reported that there chanced certain unlucky signs unto Cassius. For one of his sergeants that carried the rods before him,
brought him the garland of flowers turned backward, the which
he should have worn on his head in the time of sacrificing.
Moreover it is reported also, that another time before, in certain
sports and triumph where they carried an image of Cassius'
victory, of <term>clean</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">pure.</note> gold, it fell by chance, the man stumbling that

of <term>fowls</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">birds.</note> of prey, that feed upon dead carcases: and bee-hives
also were found, where bees were gathered together in a certain
place within the trenches of the camp: the which place the
soothsayers thought good to shut out of the precinct of the
camp, for to take away the superstitious fear and mistrust men
would have of it. The which began somewhat to alter Cassius'
mind from Epicurus' opinions, and had put the soldiers also in
a marvellous fear. <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Cassius' and Brutus' opinions about the battle.</note>Thereupon Cassius was of opinion not to
try this war at one battle, but rather to delay time, and to draw
it out in length, considering that they were the stronger in
money, and the weaker in men and armour. But Brutus, in
contrary manner, did alway before, and at that time also, desire
nothing more than to put all to the hazard of battle, as soon as
might be possible: to the end he might either quickly restore
his country to her former liberty, or rid him forthwith of this
miserable world, being <term>still</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">ever.</note> troubled in following and maintaining of such great armies together. But perceiving that, in the
<pb n="139"/>
daily skirmishes and bickerings they made, his men were always
the stronger and ever had the better, that yet quickened his spirits again, and did put him in better heart. And furthermore,
because that some of their own men had already yielded themselves to their enemies, and that it was suspected moreover
divers others would do the like, that made many of Cassius'
friends which were of his mind before (when it came to be debated in council, whether the battle should be fought or not)
that they were then of Brutus' mind. <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Atellius' opinion for the battle.</note>But yet was there one of
Brutus' friends called Atellius, that was against it, and was of
opinion that they should tarry to the next winter. Brutus asked
him what he should get by tarrying a year longer? " If I get
nothing else," quoth Atellius again, " yet have I lived so much
longer." Cassius was very angry with this answer: and Atellius
was <term>maliced</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">disliked.</note> and esteemed the worse for it of all men. Thereupon it was presently determined they should fight battle the
next day. 

<milestone n="40" unit="para"/>So Brutus, all supper-time, looked with a cheerful
countenance, like a man that had good hope, and talked very
wisely of philosophy, and after supper went to bed. <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Cassius' words unto Messala the night before the battle.</note>But touching Cassius, Messala reporteth that he supped by himself in his
tent with a few of his friends, and that all supper-time he looked
very sadly, and was full of thoughts, although it was against his
nature: and that after supper he took him by the hand, and
holding him fast (in token of kindness, as his manner was) told
him in Greek: " Messala, I protest unto thee, and make thee
my witness, that I am compelled against my mind and will (as
Pompey the Great was) to <term>jeopard</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">risk.</note> the liberty of our country to
the hazard of a battle. And yet we must be lively, and of good
courage, considering our good fortune, whom we should wrong
too much to mistrust her, although we follow evil counsel."
Messala writeth, that Cassius having spoken these last words
unto him, he bade him farewell, and willed him to come to supper to him the next night following, because it was his birthday. <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Brutus and Cassius talk before the battle.</note>The next morning, by break of day, the signal of battle
was set out in Brutus' and Cassius' camp, which was an arming
scarlet coat: and both the chieftains spake together in the
midst of their armies. There Cassius began to speak first, and
said: "The gods grant us, O Brutus, that this day we may win
the field, and ever after to live all the rest of our life quietly
one with another. But <term>sith</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">since.</note> the gods have so ordained it, that
the greatest and chiefest things amongst men are most uncertain, and that if the battle fall out otherwise to-day than we
<pb n="140"/>
wish or look for, we shall hardly meet again, what art thou then
determined to do, to fly, or die?" <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Brutus' answer to Cassius.</note>Brutus answered him, being
yet but a young man, and not over greatly experienced in the
world: " I trust (I know not how, a certain rule of philosophy,
by the which I did greatly blame and reprove Cato for killing
himself, as being no lawful nor godly act, touching the gods:
nor concerning men, valiant; not to give place and yield to
divine providence, and not constantly and patiently to take
whatsoever it pleaseth him to send us, but to draw back and
fly: but being now in the midst of the danger, I am of a contrary mind. For if it be not the will of God that this battle
fall out fortunate for us, I will look no more for hope, neither
seek to make any new supply for war again, but will rid me of
this miserable world, and content me with my fortune. For I
gave up my life for my country in the Ides of March, for the
which I shall live in another more glorious world." Cassius
fell a-laughing to hear what he said, and embracing him,
"Come on then," said he, "let us go and charge our enemies
with this mind. <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">The battle at Philippi against Octavius Caesar and Antonius.</note>For either we shall conquer, or we shall not
need to fear the conquerors." After this talk, they fell to consultation among their friends for the ordering of the battle.
Then Brutus prayed Cassius he might have the leading of the
right wing, the which men thought was far meeter for Cassius,
both because he was the elder man, and also for that he had
the better experience. But yet Cassius gave it him, and willed
that Messala (who had charge of one of the warlikest legions
they had) should be also in that wing with Brutus. So Brutus
presently sent out his horsemen, who were excellently well appointed, and his footmen also were as willing and ready to give
charge.

<milestone n="41" unit="para"/>
                  <milestone n="28" ed="Skeat" unit="chapter"/> Now Antonius' men did cast a trench from the <term>marrish</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">marsh.</note>
by the which they lay, to cut off Cassius' way to come to the sea:
and Caesar, at the least his army stirred not. As for Octavius
Caesar himself, he was not in his camp because he was sick.
And for his people, they little thought the enemies would have
given them battle, but only have made some light skirmishes to
hinder them that wrought in the trench, and with their darts
and slings to have kept them from finishing of their work: but
they, taking no heed to them that came full upon them to give
them battle, marvelled much at the great noise they heard, that
came from the place where they were casting their trench. In
the meantime Brutus, that led the right wing, sent little <term>bills</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">written messages.</note> to
<pb n="141"/>
the colonels and captains of private bands, in the which he
wrote the word of the battle; and he himself, riding a-horseback
by all the <term>troupes</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">troops.</note>, did speak to them, and encouraged them to
stick to it like men. So by this means very few of them understood what was the word of the battle, and besides, the most
part of them never tarried to have it told them, but ran with
great fury to assail the enemies; whereby, through this disorder,
the legions were marvellously scattered and dispersed one from
the other. For first of all Messala's legion, and then the next
unto them, went beyond the left wing of the enemies, and did
nothing, but glancing by them overthrew some as they went;
and so going on further, fell right upon Caesar's camp, out of the
which (as himself writeth in his commentaries) he had been conveyed away a little before, through the counsel and advice of one
of his friends called Marcus Artorius: who, dreaming in the
night, had a vision appeared unto him, that commanded 
Octavius
Caesar should be carried out of his camp. Insomuch as it was
thought he was slain, because his litter (which had nothing in it)
was thrust through and through with pikes and darts. There
was great slaughter in this camp. For amongst others, there
were slain two thousand Lacedaemonians, who were arrived but
even a little before, coming to aid Caesar. 

<milestone n="42" unit="para"/>The other also that
had not glanced by, but had given a charge full upon Caesar's
<term>battle</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">company.</note>, they easily made them fly, because they were greatly
troubled for the loss of their camp; and of them there were slain
by hand three legions. Then, being very earnest to follow the

<term>head</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">in great haste.</note> into their camp, and Brutus among them. But that which

                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">accident.</note> shewed it unto them
that they were overcome; and that was, the left wing of their

who were strayed too far off, in following of them that were
overthrown. So they gave a hot charge upon them. But, notwithstanding all the force they made, they could not break into
the midst of their battle, where they found them that received
them and valiantly made head against them. How-beit they
brake and overthrew the left wing where Cassius was, by reason
of the great disorder among them, and also because they had no
intelligence how the right wing had sped. So they chased them,
beating them into their camp, the which they spoiled, none of
both the chieftains being present there. For Antonius, as it is
reported, to fly the fury cf the first charge, was gotten into the

flight that withstood them, with great slaughter: so that Brutus
had conquered all on his side, and Cassius had lost all on the
other side. For nothing undid them but that Brutus went not
to help Cassius, thinking he had overcome them as himself had
done; and Cassius on the other side tarried not for Brutus,
thinking he had been overthrown as himself was. And to prove
that the victory fell on Brutus' side, Messala confirmeth, that
they <term>wan</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">won.</note> three eagles, and divers other ensigns of the enemies,
and their enemies wan never a one of theirs. Now Brutus returning from the chase, after he had slain and sacked Caesar's
men, he wondered much that he could not see Cassius' tent
standing up high as it was wont, neither the other tents of his
camp standing as they were before, because all the whole camp
had been spoiled, and the tents thrown down, at the first coming
of their enemies. But they that were about Brutus, whose sight
served them better, told them that they saw a great <term>glistering</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">glittering.</note>
of <term>harness</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">armour.</note>, and a number of silvered <term>targets</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">shields.</note>, that went and
came into Cassius' camp, and were not (as they took it) the armours nor the number of men that they had left there to guard the
camp; and yet that they saw not such a number of dead bodies
and great overthrow as there should have been, if so many
legions had been slain. This made Brutus at the first <term>mistrust</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">suspect.</note>
that which had happened. So he appointed a number of men to
keep the camp of his enemy which he had taken, and caused his
men to be sent for that yet followed the chase, and gathered
them together, thinking to lead them to aid Cassius, who was
in this state as you shall hear. 

<milestone n="43" unit="para"/>
                  <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Cassius offended with the sundry errors  Brutus and his men committed in battle.</note>First of all, he was marvellous
angry to see how Brutus' men ran to give charge upon their
enemies, and tarried not for the word of the battle, nor commandment to give charge: and it grieved him beside, that after
he had overcome them, his men fell straight to spoil, and were
not careful to compass in the rest of the enemies behind: but
with tarrying too long also, more than through the valiantness
or foresight of the captains his enemies, Cassius found himself
compassed in with the right wing of his enemy's army. Whereupon his horsemen brake immediately, and fled for life towards

a few about him, unto a little hill, from whence they might easily

nothing, for his sight was very bad, saving that he saw (and yet

was with him, to go and know what they were. Brutus' horsemen saw him coming afar off, whom when they knew that he
was one of Cassius' chiefest friends, they shouted out for joy;
and they that were familiarly acquainted with him lighted from

out his bare neck unto Pindarus, he gave him his head to be
stricken off. So the head was found severed from the body:
but after that time Pindarus was never seen more. Whereupon
some took occasion to say that he had slain his master without
his commandment. By and by they knew the horsemen that
came towards them, and might see Titinnius crowned with a

Cassius. But when he perceived, by the cries and tears of his

him with great cries when he went his way, praising him, for
that he only of the four chieftains was not overcome in battle.
And to speak the truth, his deeds shewed that he hoped not in
vain to be conqueror. For with few legions he had slain and
driven all them away that made head against him: and if all his
people had fought, and that the most of them had not outgone

he supposeth, more than twice as many <term>moe</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">more.</note>. Wherefore they
were more discouraged than Brutus, until that, very late at
night, there was one of Cassius' men called Demetrius, who
went unto Antonius, and carried his master's clothes, whereof he
was stripped not long before, and his sword also. This encouraged Brutus' enemies, and made them so brave, that the next
morning betimes they stood in battle <term>ray</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">array.</note> again before Brutus.

<milestone n="30" ed="Skeat" unit="chapter"/> But on Brutus' side, both his camps stood wavering,
and that in great danger. For his own camp, being full of
prisoners, required a good guard to look unto them: and
Cassius' camp on the other side took the death of their
captain very heavily; and beside, there was some vile grudge
between them that were overcome and those that did overcome. For this cause therefore Brutus did set them in
battle ray6, but yet kept himself from giving battle. Now for
the slaves that were prisoners, which were a great number,
and went and came to and fro amongst these armed men, not
without suspicion, he commanded they should kill them. But
<pb n="145"/>

for the free men, he sent them freely home, and said that they
were better prisoners with his enemies than with him. For
with them, they were slaves and servants: and with him, they
were free men and citizens. <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Brutus' clemency and courtesy.</note>So when he saw that divers captains and his friends did so cruelly hate some, that they would
by no means save their lives, Brutus himself hid them, and
secretly sent them away. Among these prisoners, there was one
Volumnius, a jester, and Sacculio, a common player, of whom
Brutus made no account at all. Howbeit his friends brought
them unto him, and did accuse them, that though they were
prisoners, they did not <term>let</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">hesitate.</note> to laugh them to scorn, and to jest
broadly with them. Brutus made no answer to it, because his
head was occupied otherwise. Whereupon Messala Corvinus
said that it were good to whip them on a scaffold, and then to
send them naked, well whipped, unto the captains of their
enemies, to shew them their shame, to keep such <term>mates</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">comrades.</note> as
those in their camp, to play the fools to make them sport. Some
that stood by laughed at his device. But Publius Casca, that
gave Julius Caesar the first wound when he was slain, said then:
"It doth not become us to be thus merry at Cassius' <term>funerals</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">burial.</note>:
and for thee, Brutus, thou shalt shew what estimation thou
madest of such a captain thy compeer, by putting to death, or
saving the lives of these <term>bloods</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">fellows.</note>, who hereafter will mock him
and defame his memory." Brutus answered again in choler:
"Why then do you come to tell me of it, Casca, and do not
yourselves what you think good?" When they heard him say so,
they took his answer for a consent against these poor unfortunate men, to suffer them to do what they thought good: and
therefore they carried them away, and slew them. 

<milestone n="46" unit="para"/>Afterwards
Brutus performed the promise he had made to the soldiers, and
gave them the two thousand drachmas apiece; but yet he first
reproved them, because they went and gave charge upon the
enemies at the first battle, before they had the word of battle
given them: and made them a new promise also, that if in the
second battle they fought like men, he would give them the sack
and spoil of two cities, to <term>wit</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">namely.</note>, Thessalonica and Lacedaemon.
<note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Brutus' fault wisely excused by Plutarch.</note>In all Brutus' life there is but this only fault to be found, and
that is not to be gainsaid: though Antonius and Octavius Caesar
did reward their soldiers far worse for their victory. For when
they had driven all the natural Italians out of Italy, they gave
their soldiers their lands and towns, to the which they had no
right: and moreover the only mark they shot at in all this war
<pb n="146"/>
they made, was but to overcome and reign: where in contrary
manner they had so great an opinion of Brutus' virtue, that the
common voice and opinion of the world would not suffer him
neither to overcome nor to save himself otherwise than justly
and honestly, and specially after Cassius' death; whom men

standing very <term>tickle</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">uncertain.</note>, and having no other captain coequal uith
him in dignity and authority, he was forced to employ them he
had; and likewise to be ruled by them in many things, and was
of mind himself also to grant them any thing that he thought
might make them serve like noble soldiers at time of need. For
Cassius' soldiers were very evil to be ruled, and did shew themselves very stubborn and <term>lusty</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">self=willed.</note> in the camp, because they had
no chieftain that did command them: but yet rank cowards to
their enemies, because they had once overcome them. 

<milestone n="47" unit="para"/>On the
other side, Octavius Caesar and Antonius were not in much
better state; for first of all they lacked victuals. And because
they were lodged in low places, they <term>looked</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">expected.</note> to abide a hard and
sharp winter, being camped as they were by the <term>marish</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">marsh.</note> side:
and also for that, after the battle, there had fallen plenty of rain
about the autumn, <term>wherethrough</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">whereby.</note> all their tents were full of mire
and dirt, the which by reason of the cold did freeze <term>incontinently</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">immediately.</note>.
<note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Brutus' victory by sea.</note>But beside all these discommodities, there came news unto them
of the great loss they had of their men by sea.  <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Wonderful famine among Caesar's soldiers by sea.</note>For Brutus'
ships met with a great aid and supply of men, which were sent
them out of Italy, and they overthrew them in such sort, that
there scaped but few of them: and yet they were so famished,
that they were compelled to eat the tackle and sails of their ships.
Thereupon they were very desirous to fight a battle again, before
Brutus should have intelligence of this good news for him: for
it chanced so, that the battle was fought by sea, on the selfsame
day it was fought by land. <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">the ignorance of Brutus' victory by sea was his utter destruction.</note>But by ill fortune, rather than
through the malice or negligence of the captains, this victory
came not to Brutus' ear till twenty days after. For had he
known of it before, he would not have been brought to have
fought a second battle, considering that he had excellent good
provision for his army for a long time; and besides lay in a
<pb n="147"/>

place of great strength, so as his camp could not greatly be
hurt by the winter, nor also distressed by his enemies: and
further, he had been a quiet lord, being a conqueror by sea, as
he was also by land. This would have marvellously encouraged
him. Howbeit the state of Rome (in my opinion) being now
brought to that pass, that it could no more abide to be governed
by many lords, but required one only absolute governor: God,
to prevent Brutus that it should not come to his government, 
kept this victory from his knowledge, though indeed it came but 
a little too late. For the day before the last battle was given,
very late in the night, came Clodius, one of his enemies, into his
camp, who told that Caesar, hearing of the overthrow of his army
by sea, desired nothing more than to fight a battle before Brutus
understood it. Howbeit they gave no credit to his words, but
despised him so much, that they would not vouchsafe to bring
him unto Brutus, because they thought it but a lie devised, to
be the better welcome for this good news.

                  <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">The evil spirit appeared again unto Brutus.</note>The selfsame night, 
it is reported that the monstrous spirit which had appeared before unto Brutus in the city of Sardis, did now appear again unto
him in the selfsame shape and form, and so vanished away, and
said never a word. <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Strange sights before Brutus' second battle.</note>Now Publius Volumnius, a grave and wise
philosopher, that had been with Brutus from the beginning of
this war, doth make no mention of this spirit; but saith that the
greatest eagle and ensign was covered over with a swarm of
bees; and that there was one of the captains, whose arm suddenly
fell a sweating, that it dropped oil of roses from him, and that
they oftentimes went <term>about</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">endeavoured.</note> to dry him, but all would do no

eagles fought between both armies, and all the time they fought 
there was a marvellous great silence all the valley over, both the 
armies being one before the other, marking this fight between,
them; and that in the end, the eagle towards Brutus gave over 
and fled away. But this is certain, and a true tale, that when 
the gate of the camp was open, the first man the standardbearer met that carried the eagle, was an Aethiopian, whom the 
soldiers, for ill luck, mangled with their swords.

                  <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Brutus' second battle.</note>Now after that Brutus had brought his army into the

                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">vanguard.</note> of his enemy, he paused a long time before he gave
the signal of battle. For Brutus riding up and down to view
the bands and companies, it canme in his head to mistrust some
of them, besides that some came to tell him so much as he
<pb n="148"/>
thought. Moreover, he saw his horsemen set forward but faintly,
and did not go lustily to give charge, but still stayed to see what
the footmen would do. Then suddenly, one of the chiefest
knights he had in all his army, called Camulatius, and that was
alway marvellously esteemed of for his valiantness, until that
time: he came hard by Brutus on horseback, and rode before
his face to yield himself unto his enemies. Brutus was marvellous sorry for it: wherefore, partly for anger, and partly for fear
of greater treason and rebellion, he suddenly caused his army to
march, being past three of the clock in the afternoon. So in
that place where he himself fought in person, he had the better,
and brake into the left wing of his enemies; which gave him
way, through the help of his horsemen that gave charge with his
footmen, when they saw the enemies in a <term>maze</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">perplexity.</note> and afraid.
Howbeit, the other also on the right wing, when the captains
would have had them to have marched, they were afraid to have
been compassed in behind, because they were fewer in number
than their enemies, and therefore did spread themselves, and
leave the <term>middest</term>

                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">midst.</note> of the conflict, did all that was

                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">won.</note> him the victory at the first battle, did now lose
it him at the second. For at the first time, the enemies that
were broken and fled were straight cut in pieces: but at the
second battle, of Cassius' men that were put to flight, there
were few slain: and they that saved themselves by speed, being
afraid because they had been overcome, did discourage the rest
of the army when they came to join with them, and filled all the
army with fear and disorder. <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">The death of the valiant young man Cato, the son of Marcus Cato.</note>There was the son of Marcus

no reckoning of all men else they met in their way, but going
all together right against Brutus, he determined to stay them with
the hazard of his life; and being left behind, told them that he
was Brutus: and because they should believe him, he prayed
them to bring him to Antonius, for he said he was afraid of
Caesar, and that he did trust Antonius better. These barbarous
men, being very glad of this good hap, and thinking themselves
happy men, they carried him in the night, and sent some before
unto Antonius, to tell him of their coming. He was marvellous
glad of it, and went out to meet them that brought him. Others
also understanding of it, that they had brought Brutus prisoner,
they came out of all parts of the camp to see him, some pitying
his hard fortune, and others saying that it was not done like himself, so cowardly to be taken alive of the barbarous people for
fear of death. When they came near together, Antonius stayed
a while bethinking himself how he should use Brutus. In the
meantime Lucilius was brought to him, who stoutly with a bold
countenance said: "Antonius, I dare assure thee, that no enemy
hath taken nor shall take Marcus Brutus alive, and I beseech God
keep him from that fortune: for wheresoever he be found, alive
or dead, he will be found like himself. And now for myself, I
am come unto thee, having deceived these men of arms here,
bearing them <term>down</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">making them believe.</note> that I was Brutus, and do not refuse to
suffer any torment thou wilt put me to." Lucilius' words made
them all amazed that heard him. Antonius on the other side,
looking upon all them that had brought him, said unto them:
" My companions, I think ye are sorry you have failed of your
purpose, and that you think this man hath done you great wrong:
but I assure you, you have taken a better booty than that you followed. For instead of an enemy you have brought me a friend:
and for my part, if you had brought me Brutus alive, truly I
cannot tell what I should have done to him. For I had rather
have such men my friends, as this man here, than mine enemies."
Then he embraced Lucilius, and at that time delivered him to one
of his friends in custody; and Lucilius ever after served him
faithfully, even to his death.

                  <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Brutus flying.</note>Now Brutus having passed a little
river, walled in on every side with high rocks and shadowed with
great trees, being then dark night, he went no further, but stayed
at the foot of a rock with certain of his captains and friends that
followed him: and looking up to the firmament that was full of
<pb n="150"/>
stars, sighing, he rehearsed two verses, of the which Volumnius
wrote the one, to this effect:

<quote rend="blockquote">
                     <l>Let not the wight from whom this mischief vent,</l>
                     <l>O Jove, escape without due punishment:&mdash;</l>
                  </quote>

and saith that he had forgotten the other. Within a little while
after, naming his friends that he had seen slain in battle before
his eyes, he fetched a greater sigh than before, specially when he
came to name Labio and Flavius, of whom the one was his
lieutenant, and the other captain of the <term>pioners</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">pioneers.</note> of his camp.
In the meantime one of the company being athirst, and seeing
Brutus athirst also, he ran to the river for water, and brought it
in his <term>sallet</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">helmet.</note>. At the same time they heard a noise on the other
side of the river: whereupon Volumnius took Dardanus, Brutus'
servant, with him, to see what it was: and returning straight
again, asked if there were any water left. Brutus smiling, gently
told him, "All is <term>drunk</term>
                  <note resp="trans" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">so. ed. 1631: told them ail was (1612).</note>, but they shall bring you some more."
Thereupon he sent him again that went for water before, who
was in great danger of being taken by the enemies, and hardly
escaped, being sore hurt.

<milestone n="32" ed="Skeat" unit="chapter"/> Furthermore, Brutus thought that there was no great
number of men slain in battle: and to know the truth of it, there
was one called Statilius, that promised to go through his enemies,
for otherwise it was impossible to go see their camp: and from
thence, if all were well, that he would lift up a torch-light in
the air, and then return again with speed to him. The torchlight was <term>lift</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">lifted.</note> up as he had promised, for Statilius went thither.

<milestone n="52" unit="para"/>Now the night
being far spent, Brutus as he sat bowed towards Clitus, one of his
men, and told him somewhat in his ear: the other answered him
not, but fell a-weeping. Thereupon he <term>proved</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">tried.</note> Dardanus, and
said somewhat also to him: at length he came to Volumnius himself, and speaking to him in Greek, prayed him for the studies' 
sake
which brought them acquainted together, that he would help him
to put his hand to his sword, to thrust it in him to kill him.
Volumnius denied his request, and so did many others: and
amongst the rest, one of them said, there was no tarrying for
them there, but that they must needs fly. <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Brutus' saying of flying with hands and not with feet.</note>Then Brutus, rising
up, "We must fly indeed," said he, "but it must be with our

he said these words unto them with a cheerful countenance: " It
rejoiceth my heart, that not one of my friends hath failed me at

country's sake: for as for me, I think myself happier than they

among the which Strato was one, with whom he came first acquainted by the study of rhetoric. He came as near to him
as he could, and taking his sword by the hilt with both his
hands, and falling down upon the point of it, ran himself through.
Others say that not he, but Strato (at his request) held the sword
in his hand, and turned his head aside, and that Brutus fell

                  <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Antonius' parentage.</note>Antonius, grandfather was that famous orator whom
Marius slew because he took Sylla's part. His father was
another Antonius 
<term>surnamed Cretan</term>
                  <note resp="trans" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">Because that by his death he ended the war which he unfortunately made against those of Creta.</note>, who was not so famous,
nor bare any great sway in the commonwealth: howbeit other
wise he was an honest man, and of a very good nature, and
<pb n="154"/>
specially very liberal in giving, as appeareth by an act he did.
He was not very wealthy, and therefore his wife would not let
<note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">The liberality of Antonius' father.</note>him use his liberality and frank nature. One day a friend of his
coming to him to pray him to help him to some money, having
great need, Antonius by chance had no money to give him, but
he commanded one of his men to bring him some water in a
silver basin, and after he had brought it him, he washed his
beard as though he meant to have shaven it, and then found an

<term>arrand</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">errand.</note> for his man to send him out, and gave his friend the
silver basin, and bade him get him money with that. Shortly
after' there was a great stir in the house among the servants,
seeking out of this silver basin. Insomuch as Antonius, seeing 
his
wife marvellously offended for it, and that she would examine all
her servants one affair another about it, to know what was be
come of it, at length he confessed he had given it away, and
prayed her to be contented. 

<milestone n="2" unit="para"/>
                  <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Julia the mother of M. Antonius.</note>His wife was Julia, of the noble
house and family of Julius Caesar: who, for her virtue and chastity, 
was to be compared with the noblest lady of her time.
Marcus Antonius was brought up under her, being married
after her first husband's death unto Cornelius Lentulus, whom
Cicero put to death with Cethegus and others, for that he
was of Catiline's conspiracy against the Commonwealth. And
this seemeth to be the original cause and beginning of the cruel
and mortal hate Antonius bare unto Cicero. For Antonius self
saith, that 
<term>he</term>
                  <note resp="trans" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">i.e. Cicero.</note> would never give him the body of his father-in-law
to bury him, before his mother went first to entreat Cicero's
wife the which undoubtedly was a flat lie. For Cicero denied
burial to none of them whom he executed by law. Now Antonius
being a fair young man, and in the prime of his youth,<note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Antonius corrupted by Curio.</note> he fell
acquainted with Curio, whose friendship and acquaintance (as it
is reported) was a plague unto him. For he was a dissolute
man, given over to all lust and insolency, who, to have Antonius
the better at his commandment, 
<term>trained</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">lured.</note> him on into great follies
and vain expenses upon women, in rioting and banqueting: so
that in short time he brought Antonius into a marvellous great
debt, and too great for one of his years, 
<term>to wit</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">namely.</note>, of two hundred and fifty talents, for all which sum Curio was surety.  His father hearing of it, did put his son from him, and forbad him
his house. Then he fell in with Clodius, one of the desperatest
and most wicked tribunes at that time in Rome. Him he

followed for a time in his desperate attempts, who bred great
stir and mischief in Rome: but at length he forsook him, being

<pb n="155"/>
weary of his rashness and folly, or else for that he was afraid of
them that were bent against Clodius.

<milestone n="2" ed="Skeat" unit="chapter"/> Thereupon he left Italy, and went into Greece, and there

<term>bestowed</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">employed.</note> the most part of his time, sometime in wars, and
otherwhile in the study of eloquence. <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Antonius used in his speaking the Asiatic phrase.</note>He used a manner of
phrase in his speech called Asiatic, which carried the best
grace and estimation at that time, and was much like to his
manners and life: for it was full of ostentation, foolish 
<term>bravery</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">bragging.</note>,
and vain ambition. 

<milestone n="3" unit="para"/>After he had remained there some time.
Gabinius, proconsul, going into Syria, persuaded him to go with
him; Antonius told him he would not go as a private man:
wherefore <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Antonius had charge of horsemen under Gabinius , proconsul, going into Syria.</note> Gabinius gave him charge of his horsemen, and so
took him with him. So, first of all he sent him against Aristobulus, 
who had made the Jews to rebel, and was the first man
himself that got up to the wall of a castle of his, and <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Antonius' acts against Aristobulus.</note>so drove
Aristobulus out of all his holds: and with those few men he had
with him, he overcame all the Jews in set battle, which were
many against one, and put all of them almost to the sword ; and
furthermore, <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Antonius took Aristobulus prisoner.</note>took Aristobulus himself prisoner with his son.
Afterwards Ptolemy, king of Egypt, that had been driven out of
his country, went unto Gabinius to intreat him to go with his
army with him into Egypt, to put him again into his kingdom:
and promised him, if he would go with him, ten thousand talents.
The most part of the captains thought it not best to go thither, and
Gabinius himself 
<term>made it dainty to enter</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">shrank from entering.</note> into this war, although
the covetousness of 
these
10,000 talents stuck sorely with him.
But Antonius, that sought but for opportunity and good occasion
to attempt great enterprises, and that desired also to gratify
Ptolemy's request, he went about to persuade Gabinius to go
this voyage. Now they were more afraid of the way they should
go, to come to the city of Pelusium, than they feared any danger
of the war besides because they were to pass through deep
sands and desert places, where was no fresh water to be had all
the marishes; through, which are called the 
<term>marishes</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">marches.</note> Serbonides,
which the Egyptians call the exhalations or fume, by the which
the giant Typhon breathed. But in truth it appeareth to be the
overflowing of the Red Sea, which breaketh out under the ground
in that place where it is divided in the narrowest place from the
sea on this side. <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Antonius' acts in Egypt under Gabinius.</note>So Antonius was sent before into Egypt with
his horsemen, who did not only win that passage, but also took
the city of Pelusium (which is a great city) with all the soldiers in
it: and thereby he cleared the way, and made it safe for all the

<pb n="156"/>
rest of the army, and the hope of the victory also certain for his
captain. Now did the enemies themselves feel the fruits of
Antonius' courtesy, and the desire he had to win honour: for
when Ptolemy (after he had entered into the city of Pelusium),
for the malice he bare unto the city, would have put all the
Egyptians in it to the sword, Antonius withstood him, and by no
means would suffer him to do it. And in all other great battles
and skirmishes which they fought, being many in number, Antonius 
did many noble acts of a valiant and wise captain: but
specially in one battle, where he compassed in the enemies
behind, giving them the victory that fought in front, whereby he
afterwards had such honourable reward as his valiantness de
served.<note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Antonius' courtesy unto Archelaus being dead.</note> So was his great courtesy also much commended of all,
the which he shewed unto Archelaus: for having been his very
friend, he made war with him against his will while he lived;
but after his death he fought for his body, and gave it honour
able burial. For these respects he 
<term>wan</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">won.</note> himself great fame of them
of Alexandria, and he was also thought a worthy man of all the
soldiers in the Romans' camp. 

<milestone n="4" unit="para"/>But besides all this,<note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Antonius' shape and presence.</note> he had a
noble presence, and shewed a countenance of one of a noble
house: he had a goodly thick beard, a broad forehead, crooked
nosed, and there appeared such a manly look in his countenance,
as is commonly seen in Hercules, pictures, stamped or graven in
metal. Now it had been a speech of old time, <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">The house of the Antonii descended from Hercules.</note>that the family of the
Antonii were descended from one Anton the son of Hercules,
whereof the family took name. This opinion did Antonius seek
to confirm in all his doings: not only resembling him in the
likeness of his body, as we have said before, but also in the
wearing of his garments. For when he would openly shew him
self abroad before many people, he would always wear his 

<term>cassock</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">robe.</note>: girt down low upon his hips, with a great sword hanging
by his side, and 
<term>upon</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">above.</note> that, some ill-favoured cloak. Further
more, things that seem intolerable in other men, as to boast
commonly, to jest with one or other, to drink like a good fellow
with everybody, to sit with the soldiers when they dine, and to
eat and drink with them soldier-like, it is incredible what 
wonderful love it 
<term>wan</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">won.</note> him amongst them. And furthermore, being
given to love, that made him the more desired, and by that
means he brought many to love him. For he would further
everyman's love, and also would not be angry that men should
merrily tell him of those he loved. But besides all this, that which
<note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Antonius' liberality.</note>most procured his rising and advancement, was his liberality,
<pb n="157"/>

who gave all to the soldiers, and kept nothing for himself: and
when he was grown to great credit, then was his authority and
power also very great, the which notwithstanding himself did
overthrow by a thousand other faults he had. In this place I
will shew you one example only of his wonderful liberality. He
commanded one day his 
<term>cofferer</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">treasurer.</note> that kept his money, to give a
friend of his five and twenty myriads, which the Romans call in
their tongue <name>decies</name>. His cofferer marvelling at it, and being
angry withal in his mind, brought him all this money in a heap
together, to shew him what a marvellous mass of money it was.
Antonius seeing it as he went by, asked what it was: the cofferer
answered him, "It was the money he willed him to give unto his
friend." Then Antonius, perceiving the spite of his man, "I
thought," said he, "that <name>decies</name> had been a greater sum of 
money

                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">plots.</note>. For so soon as 
Antonius became tribune, he did oppose himself against those things
which the Consul Marcellus preferred (who ordained that certain
legions which had been already levied and

                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">enrolled.</note>, should be given
unto Cneus Pompey, with further commission and authority to
levy others unto them), and set down an order, that the soldiers
which were already levied and assembled should be sent into
Syria, for a new supply unto Marcus Bibulus, who made war
at that time against the Parthians. And further gave a prohibition
 that Pompey should levy no more men, and also that
the soldiers should not obey him. Secondly, where Pompey's
friends and followers would not suffer Caesar's letters to be received
 and openly read in the senate, <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Antonius acts for Caesar.</note>Antonius, having power

did read them openly, and made divers men change their
minds: for it appeared to them that Caesar by his letters 
required no unreasonable matters. At length, when they preferred
two matters of consideration unto the Senate, whether they
thought good that Pompey or Caesar should leave their army,
there were few of the senators that thought it meet Pompey
should leave his army, but they 
<term>all in manner</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">as it were.</note> commanded
Caesar to do it. Then Antonius rising up, asked whether they
thought it good that Pompey and Caesar both should leave their
armies. Thereupon all the senators jointly together gave their
whole consent, and with a great cry commending Antonius, they
prayed him to refer it to the judgment of the senate. But the
Consuls would not allow of that. Therefore Caesar's friends
preferred other reasonable demands and requests again, but
Cato spake against them: and Lentulus, one of the Consuls,
crave Antonius by force out of the Senate, who at his going out
made grievous curses against him. <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Antonius flieth from Rome unto Caesar.</note>After that, he took a slave's

<term>incontinently</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">at once.</note>
into Italy with his army, which made Cicero say in his

                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">strong, great.</note> lie. For Caesar was not so fickle-headed, nor so easily
carried away with anger, that he would so suddenly have gone
and made war with his country, upon the sight only of 
Antonius and Cassius, being fled to him in miserable apparel, and
in a hired coach, had he not long before determined it with
himself. But sith indeed Caesar looked of long time but for

governor of Rome; and Antonius, that was tribune, he gave
him charge of all the soldiers and of Italy. <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Caesar gave the charge of Italy unto Antonius.</note>Then was Antonius

conclude, Caesar's friends, that governed under him, were cause
why they hated Caesar's government (which indeed in respect of
himself was no less than tyranny) by reason of the great 
insolencies and outrageous parts that were committed: amongst
whom Antonius, that was of greatest power, and that also 
committed greatest faults, deserved most blame. 

<milestone n="7" unit="para"/>But Caesar, not
withstanding, when he returned from the wars of Spain, made
no reckoning of the complaints that were put up against him:
but contrarily, because he found him a hardy man, and a valiant
captain, he employed him in his chiefest affairs, and was no
whit deceived in his opinion of him.

<milestone n="4" ed="Skeat" unit="chapter"/> So he passed over the Ionian sea unto Brundusium
being but slenderly accompanied, and sent unto Antonius and
Gabinius, that they should

But Antonius, fearing some danger might come unto Caesar, be
cause he was compassed in with a great number of enemies
first of all he drave away Libo, who rode at anchor with a great
army before the haven of Brundusium. For he manned out
such a number of pinnaces, barks, and other small boats about
every one of his galleys, that he crave him thence. <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Antonius taketh sea with his army at Brundusium, and goeth unto Caesar.</note>After that,

they made out to follow him: but the sea rose so high, that the
billows put back their galleys that they could not come near him,
and so he scaped that danger. But withal he fell upon the rocks
with his whole fleet, where the sea wrought very high, so that
he was out of all hope to save himself. Yet, by good fortune,
<pb n="160"/>

suddenly the wind turned south-west, and blew from the gulf,
driving the waves of the river into the main sea. Thus Antonius,
loosing from the land, and sailing with safety at his pleasure,
soon after he saw all the coasts full of 
<term>shipwracks</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">shipwrecks.</note>. For the
force and boisterousness of the wind did cast away the galleys
that followed him: of the which, many of them were broken and

<term>splitted</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">split.</note>, and divers also cast away; and Antonius took a great
number of them prisoners, with a great sum of money also. Be
sides all these, he took the city of Lyssus, and brought Caesar a
great supply of men, and made him courageous, coming at a
pinch with so great a power to him. 

<milestone n="8" unit="para"/>

at two several times, when Caesar's men turned their backs, and
fled for life. For he stepped before them, and compelled them
to return again to fight: so that the victory fell on Caesar's side.
For this cause he had the second p]ace in the camp among the
soldiers, and they spake of no other man unto Caesar, but of him:
who shewed plainly what opinion he had of him, when at the
last battle of Pharsalia (which indeed was the last trial of all, to
give the conqueror the whole empire of the world) he himself
did lead the right wing of his army, and <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Antonius led the left wing of Caesar's battle at Pharsalia, where Pompey lost the field.</note>gave Antonius the 
leading of the left wing, as the valiantest man and skilfullest soldier
of all those he had about him. After Caesar had won the victory,

to have this law of the New Tables to pass by force. Antonius,
by commandment of the senate, who had given him authority
to levy men and to use force against Dolabella, went against
him, and fought so valiantly, that men were slain on both sides.

<milestone n="5" ed="Skeat" unit="chapter"/> But by this means he got the ill will of the common

grieved men much to see that Caesar should be out of Italy

and danger, and that others in the mean time, abusing his name
and authority, should commit such insolent and outrageous parts
upon their citizens. 

<milestone n="10" unit="para"/>This methinks was the cause that made the
conspiracy against Caesar increase more and more, and laid the
reins of the bridle upon the soldiers' necks, whereby they durst
more boldly commit many extortions, cruelties, and robberies.
And therefore Caesar after his return pardoned Dolabella, and
<note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Caesar and Lepidus, consuls.</note>being created Consul the third time, he took not Antonius, but
chose Lepidus his colleague and fellow-consul. Afterwards when

life, <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Antonius married Fulvia, Claudius' widow.</note>and married Fulvia that was Clodius' widow, a woman not

many pretty youthful parts to make her merry. As he did once,
when Caesar returned the last time of all conqueror out of Spain,
every man went out to meet him, and so did Antonius with the
rest. But on the sudden there ran a rumour through Italy, that
Caesar was dead, and that his enemies came again with a great
army. Thereupon he returned with speed to Rome, and took
one of his men's gowns, and so apparelled came home to his
house in a dark night, saying, that he had brought Fulvia letters
from Antonius. So he was let in and brought to her muffled as

Spain, all the chiefest nobility of the city rode many days journey
from Rome to meet him, where Caesar made marvellous
much of Antonius above all the men that came unto him. For
he always took him into his coach with him throughout all Italy,
and behind him Brutus Albinus and Octavius the son of his
niece, who afterwards was called Caesar, and became Emperor
of Rome long time after. So Caesar being afterwards chosen
Consul the

                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">fifth.</note>time, <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Caesar and Antonius, consuls.</note>he immediately chose Antonius his 
colleague and companion; and desired, by deposing himself of his
consulship, to make Dolabella Consul in his room, and had
already moved it to the senate. But Antonius did stoutly
withstand it, and openly reviled Dolabella in the Senate, and
Dolabella also spared him as little. Thereupon Caesar being
ashamed of the matter, he let it alone. Another time also, when
Caesar attempted again to substitute Dolabella Consul in his
place, Antonius cried out, that the signs of the birds were
against it: so that at length Caesar was compelled to give him
place, and to let Dolabella alone, who was marvellously offended
with him. Now in truth Caesar made no great reckoning of
either of them both. For it is reported that Caesar answered
one that did accuse Antonius and Dolabella unto him for some
matter of conspiracy: "Tush," said he, "they be not those fat
fellows and fine combed men that I fear, but I mistrust rather
these pale and lean men," 
<term>meaning by</term>

<term>colour</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">excuse.</note> to do as they did: as you shall hear. The Romans by
chance celebrated the feast called Lupercalia, and Caesar, being
apparelled in his triumphing robe, was set in the Tribune where
they use to make their orations to the people, and from thence
did behold the sport of the runners. The manner of this running
was thus. On that day there are many young men of noble
house, and those specially that be chief officers for that year,
who running naked up and down the city, anointed with the oil
of olive, for pleasure do strike them they meet in their way with
white leather thongs they have in their hands. Antonius, being
one among the rest that was to run, leaving the ancient 
ceremonies and old customs of that solemnity, he ran to the tribune
where Caesar was set, and carried a laurel crown in his hand,
<pb n="164"/>

 having a royal band or diadem wreathed about it, which in old
time was the ancient mark and token of a king. When he was
<note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Antonius Lupercian putteth the diadem upon Caesar's head.</note>come to Caesar, he made his fellow-runners with him lift him up,
and so he did put his laurel crown upon his head, signifying
thereby that he had deserved to be king. But Caesar, making as
though he refused it, turned away his head. The people were
so rejoiced at it, that they all clapped their hands for joy. Antonius 
again did put it on his head: Caesar again refused it ; and
thus they were striving off and on a great while together. he
oft as Antonius did put this laurel crown unto him, a few of his
followers rejoiced at it: and as oft also as Caesar refused it, all
the people together clapped their hands. And this was a wonderful
thing, that they suffered all things subjects should do by
commandment of their kings: and yet they could not abide the
name of a king, detesting it as the utter destruction of their
liberty. Caesar, in a rage, arose out of his seat, and plucking
down the collar of his gown from his neck, he shewed it naked,
bidding any man strike off his head that would. This laurel
crown was afterwards put upon the head of one of Caesar's
statues or images, the which one of the tribunes plucked off.
The people liked his doing therein so well, that they waited on
him home to his house, with great clapping of hands. Howbeit
Caesar did turn them out of their offices for it.

selfsame day he did bid Cassius to supper, and Lepidus also
bade Brutus. The next morning the senate was assembled, and 
Antonius himself 
<term>preferred</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">proposed.</note> a law, that all things past should
be forgotten, and that they should appoint provinces unto 
Cassius and Brutus: the which the senate confirmed, and further
ordained, that they should cancel none of Caesar's laws. Thus
went Antonius out of the senate more praised and better 
esteemed than ever man was, because it seemed to every man
that he had cut off all occasion of civil wars, and that he had
shewed himself a marvelous wise governor of the common
wealth, for the appeasing of these matters of so great weight
and importance. But not the opinion he conceived of himself
after he had a little felt the good-will of the people towards
him, hoping thereby to make himself the chiefest man if he
might overcome Brutus, did easily make him alter his first
mind. And therefore, when Caesar's body was brought to the
place where it should be-buried, he made a funeral oration in
commendation of Caesar, according to the ancient custom of
praising noble men at their funerals. When he saw that the
people were very glad and desirous also to hear Caesar spoken
of, and his praises uttered, he mingled his oration with lament
able words ; and by amplifying of matters did greatly move their
hearts and affections unto pity and compassion. In 
<term>fine</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">finally.</note>, to
conclude his oration, he unfolded before the whole assembly
the bloody garments of the dead, thrust through in many places
with their swords, and called the malefactors cruel and cursed
murtherers. <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Antonius maketh uproar among the people, for the murther of Caesar.</note>With these words he put the people into such a

and ran to the murtherers' houses to set them on fire, and to
make them come out to fight. 

<milestone n="15" unit="para"/>Brutus therefore and his

of 4000 talents; and furthermore brought him all Caesar's books
and writings, in the which were his memorials of all that he had
done and ordained. Antonius did daily mingle with them such
as he thought good, and by that means he created new officers,
made new senators, called home some that were banished, and
delivered those that were prisoners: and then he said, that all
those things were so appointed and ordained by Caesar. There

Caesar the younger came to Rome, who was the son of Julius
Caesar's niece, as you have heard before, and was left his lawful
heir by will, remaining, at the time of the death of his great
uncle that was slain, in the city of Apollonia This young man
at his first arrival went to salute Antonius, as one of his late
dead father Caesar's friends, who by his last will and testament
had made him his heir; and withal, he was presently in hand
with him for money and other things which were left of trust in
his hands; because Caesar had by will bequeathed unto the 
people of Rome threescore and fifteen silver drachmas to be given to
every man, the which he as heir stood- charged withal. 
Antonius at the first made no reckoning of him, because he was very
young, and said, he lacked wit and good friends to advise him,
if he looked to take such a charge in hand, as to undertake to
be Caesar's heir. <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Variance betwixt Antonius and Octavius Caesar, heir unto Julius Caesar.</note>But when Antonius saw that he could not

with him for his father's goods, but specially for the ready
money, then he spake and did what he could against him. And
first of all, it was he that did keep him from being Tribune of
the people: and also, when Octavius Caesar began to meddle
with the dedicating of the chair of gold, which was prepared by
the senate to honour Caesar with, he threatened to send him to
prison, and moreover desisted not to put the people in an up
roar. 

<note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Octavius Caesar joined in friendship with Cicero.</note>This young Caesar, seeing his doings, went unto Cicero
and others, which were Antonius' enemies, and by them crept
into favour with the senate: and he himself sought the people's
good will every manner of way, gathering together the old 
<pb n="167"/>
soldiers of the late deceased Caesar, which were dispersed in divers
cities and colonies. Antonius, being afraid of it, <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Antonious and Octavius became friends. Antonius' dream.</note>talked with
Octavius in the Capitol, and became his friend. But the very
same night Antonius had a strange dream, who thought that
lightning fell upon him, and burnt his right hand. Shortly after
word was brought him, that Caesar lay in wait to kill him. 
Caesar cleared himself unto him, and told him there was no such
matter: but he could not make Antonius believe to the contrary.
Whereupon they became further enemies than ever they were:
insomuch that both of them made friends of either side to gather
together all the old soldiers through Italy, that were dispersed in
divers towns: and made them large promises, and sought also
to win the legions on their side, which were already in arms.


<milestone n="17" unit="para"/>Cicero on the other side, being at that time the chiefest man of
authority and estimation in the city, he stirred up all men
against Antonius: <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Antonius judged and enemy by the Senate.</note>so that in the end he made the senate

their intent was to join with the legions that were on the other
side of the mountains, under Lepidus, charge: whom Antonius
took to be his friend, because he had holpen him to many
things at Caesar's hand, through his means. When he was come
to the place where Lepidus was, he camped hard by him: and
when he saw that no man came to him to put him in any hope,
he determined to 
<term>venter</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">venture.</note> himself, and to go unto Lepidus.
Since the overthrow he had at Modena, he suffered his beard to
grow at length and never clips it, that it was marvellous long,
and the hair of his head also without combing: and besides all
this, he went in a mourning gown, and after this sort came

<term>hard</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">close.</note>to the trenches of Lepidus' camp. Then he began to
speak unto the soldiers, and many of them their hearts yearned
for pity to see him so poorly arrayed, and some also, through his
words, began to pity him: insomuch that Lepidus began to be
afraid, and therefore commanded all the trumpets to sound 
together to stop the soldiers' ears, that they should not hearken
to Antonius. This notwithstanding, the soldiers took the more
pity of him, and spake secretly with him by Clodius' and Laelius'
means, whom they sent unto him disguised in women's apparel,
and gave him counsel that he should not be afraid to enter into
their camp, for there were a great number of soldiers that would
receive him, and kill Lepidus, if he would say the word. 
Antonius would not suffer them to hurt him, but the next morning
he went with his army to wade a ford, at a little river that ran
between them: and himself was the foremost man that 
<term>took</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">entered.</note> the
river to get over, seeing a number of Lepidus, camp, that gave
him their hands, plucked up the stakes, and <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Antonius won all Ledipus' army from him.</note>laid flat the bank
of their trench to let him into their camp. When he was come
into their camp, and that he had all the army at his 
commandment, he used Lepidus very courteously, embraced him, and
called him father: and though indeed Antonius did all, and
ruled the whole army, yet he alway gave Lepidus the name and
honour of the captain. Munacius Plancus, lying also in camp
hard by with an army, understanding the report of Antonius'
courtesy, he also came and joined with him.

<milestone n="10" ed="Skeat" unit="chapter"/> Thus Antonius being afoot again, and grown of great
power, repassed over the Alps, leading into Italy with him
seventeen legions, and ten thousand horsemen, besides six 
legions he left in garrison among the Gauls, under the charge
of one<note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Varius surnamed Cotylon.</note> Varius, a companion of his that would drink lustily with

Antonius also forsook Lucius Caesar, who was his uncle by his

Antonius requested Paulus might be slain, and that Lepidus was
contented with it In my opinion there was never a more

them. 

<milestone n="20" unit="para"/>After this plot was agreed upon between them, the 
soldiers that were thereabouts would have his friendship and
league betwixt them confirmed by marriage, and that Caesar
should marry Claudia, the daughter of Fulvia, Antonius, wife.
This marriage also being agreed upon, they condemned 300 of
the chiefest citizens of Rome to be put to death by proscription
And Antonius also commanded them to whom he had given<note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Antonius' cruelty unto Cicero.</note>
commission to kill Cicero, that they should strike off his head
and right hand, with the which he had written the invective
orations (called Philippides) against Antonius. So when the
murtherers brought him Cicero's head and hand cut off, he be
held them a long time with great joy, and laughed heartily, and
that oftentimes, for the great joy he felt. Then when he had
taken his pleasure of the sight of them, he caused them to be
set up in an open place, over the pulpit for orations (where,
when he was alive, he had often spoken to the people), as if he
<pb n="170"/>

 had done the dead man hurt, and not blemished his own for
tune, strewing himself (to his great shame and infamy) a cruel
man, and unworthy the office and authority he bare. His uncle
Lucius Caesar also, as they sought for him to kill him and 
followed him hard, fled unto his sister. The murderers coming
thither, forcing to break into her chamber, she stood at her
chamber-door with her arms abroad, crying out still: <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Lucius Caesar's life saved by his sister.</note>"You

sometimes thrust from the gate with violence: and that the

to make this summons unto her, was called Dellius; who when

Cleopatra on the other side, believing Dellius' words, and guessing
by the former access and credit she had with Julius Caesar and
C. Pompey (the son of Pompey the Great) only for her beauty,
she began to have good hope that she might more easily win
Antonius. For Caesar and Pompey knew her when she was but
a young thing, and knew not then what the world meant: but
now she went to Antonius at the age when a woman's beauty is

alone in the market-place, in his imperial seat, to give audience:
and there went a rumour in the people's mouths, that the goddess
Venus was come to play with the god Bacchus, for the general

yielded himself to go with Cleopatra unto Alexandria, where he

hereof, I have heard my grandfather Lampryas report, that one
Philotas, a physician, born in the city of Amphissa, told him
that he was at that present time in Alexandria, and studied
physic; and that having acquaintance with one of Antonius,
cooks, he took him with him to Antonius, house (being a young

quoth he, "not many guests, nor above twelve in all: but yet all
that is boiled or roasted must be served in whole, or else it would
be marred straight: for Antonius peradventure will sup presently,
or it may be a pretty while hence, or likely enough he will defer

to him: " It is good in some sort to let a man drink cold water
that hath an ague: but every man that hath an ague, hath it in
some sort: ergo, it is good for every man that hath an ague to
drink cold water." The physician was so

withal, that he had not a word more to say. Young Antonius
burst out into such a laughing at him, and was so glad of it, that
he said unto him: " Philotas, take all that, I give it thee :"
strewing him his cupboard full of plate, with great pots of gold
and silver. Philotas thanked him, and told him he thought
himself greatly bound to him for this liberality, but he would
never have thought that he had had power to have given so
many things, and of so great value. But much more he marvel
led, when shortly after one of young Antonius' men brought
him home all the pots in a basket, bidding him set his mark 
and
stamp upon them, and to lock them up. Philotas returned the
bringer of them, fearing to be reproved if he took them. Then
the young gentleman Antonius said unto him: "Alas, poor man,
why doest thou make it

kinds. For she (were it in sport, or in matters of earnest) still

devised sundry new delights to have Antonius at commandment, 
never leaving him night nor day, nor once letting him go out

of her sight. For she would play at dice with him, drink with 
him, and hunt commonly with him, and also be with him
when he went to any exercise or activity of body. And some
time also, when he would go up and down the city disguised
like a slave in the night, and would peer into poor men's

and got into the fisher-boats to see this fishing. Antonius
then threw in his line, and Cleopatra straight commanded one
of her men to dive under water before Antonius' men, and to
put some old salt-fish upon his bait, like unto those that are
brought out of the country of Pont. When he had hung the
fish on his hook, Antonius, thinking he had taken a fish in

fell to

were both driven to fly out of Italy. The second news, as

Syria unto the country of Lydia and Ionia. Then began

together been overcome in several battles. Howbeit Ventidius
durst not undertake to follow them any farther, fearing lest he
should have gotten Antonius' displeasure by it. 
Notwithstanding, he led his army against them that had rebelled, and 
conquered them again: amongst whom he besieged Antiochus king
of Commagena, who offered him to give a thousand talents to
be pardoned his rebellion, and promised ever after to be at
Antonius' commandment. But Ventidius made him answer,
that he should send unto Antonius; who was not far off, and
would not suffer Ventidius to make any peace with Antiochus,
to the end that yet this little exploit should pass in his name,
and that they should not think he did anything but by his lieu
tenant Ventidius. The siege grew very long, because they that
were in the town, seeing they could not be received upon no
reasonable composition, determined valiantly to defend them
selves to the last man. Thus Antonius did nothing, and yet
received great shame, repenting him much that he took not
their first offer. And yet at the last he was glad to make truce
with Antiochus, and to take three hundred talents for

feasted Caesar, which he granted unto for his sister's sake.
Afterwards they agreed together, that Caesar should give
Antonius two legions to go against the Parthians, and that
Antonius should let Caesar have an hundred galleys armed with

For the high provinces of Asia have no trees growing of such

that if he lay still and did nothing, his men's hearts would fail

than within an arrow's

followed them hard in chase, being in great hope by this conflict
to have brought to end all or the most part of this war. But
after that his footmen had chased them fifty furlongs off, and the
horsemen also thrice as far, they found in all but thirty prisoners
taken, and about fourscore men only slain: which did much

<milestone n="40" unit="para"/>Thus the war fell out
troublesome unto both parties, and the end thereof much more
fearful; for Antonius could look for no other of his side but
famine, because he could forage no more, nor fetch in any
victuals, without great loss of his men. Phraortes, on the other
side, he knew well enough that he could bring the Parthians to
anything else but to lie in camp abroad in the winter. There
fore he was afraid, that if the Romans continued their siege all
winter long and made war with him still, that his men would
forsake him, and specially because the time of the year went
away apace, and the air waxed cloudy and cold in the 
equinoctial autumn. Thereupon he called to mind this device:
<note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">The craft of the Parthians against Romans.</note>He gave the chiefest of his gentlemen of the Parthians charge,
that when they met the Romans out of their camp, going to

that they should not distress them too much, but should suffer
them to carry somewhat away, and greatly commend their
valiantness and hardiness, for which their king did esteem them
the more, and not without cause. After these first baits and 
allurements, they began by little and little to come nearer unto them,
and to talk with them a-horseback, greatly blaming Antonius, self
will, that did not give their king Phraortes occasion to make a
good peace, who desired nothing more than to save the lives of
so goodly a company of valiant men: but that he was too fondly

times brought to Antonius, they made him a little pliant, for
the good hope he had of his return: but yet he would not send
unto the king of Parthia before they had first asked these 
barbarous people that spake so courteously unto his men, whether
they spake it of themselves, or that they were their master's
words. When they told them the king himself said so, and

did persuade them further not to fear or mistrust them, then
Antonius sent some of his friends unto the king, to make
demand for the delivery of the ensigns and prisoners he
had of the Romans since the overthrow of Crassus, to the end
it should not appear that, if he asked nothing, they should
think he were glad that he might only scape with safety out
of the danger he was in. The king of Parthia answered him,
that, for the ensigns and prisoners he demanded, he should not

came, being a plain barren country without wood. But 
there
came a soldier to him, born in the country of the Mardians,
who, by oft frequenting the Parthians of long time, knew their
fashions very well, and had also shewed himself very true and
faithful to the Romans in the battle where Antonius, engines of
battery and carriage were taken away. This man came unto
Antonius, to counsel him to beware how he went that way, and
to make his army a prey (being heavily armed) unto so great a
number of horsemen, all archers in the open field, where they
should hate nothing to

he might afterwards meet him as he would in the plains: 
howbeit that he would guide him, if he thought good, another way on
the right hand, through woods and mountains, a far nearer way,
and wheel he should find great plenty of all things needful for
his army. Antonius hearing what he said, called his counsel
together to consult upon it. For after he had made peace with
<pb n="190"/>
the Parthians, he was loth to give them cause to think he mistrusted
them: and on the other side also he would gladly
shorten his way, and pass by places well inhabited, where he
might be provided of all things necessary: therefore he asked
the Mardian what pledge he would put in, to perform that he
promised. The Mardian gave himself to be bound hand and
foot, till he had brought his army into the country of Armenia.
So he guided the army thus bound, two days together, without
any trouble or sight of enemy. But the third day Antonius,
thinking the Parthians would no more follow him, and trusting
therein, suffered the soldiers to march in disorder as every man

ranks, and their light-armed men gave charge upon them. So
after they had hurt many of the Romans with their arrows, and
that they themselves were also hurt by them with their darts and

were not so hot upon them as they were commanded, but excusing
themselves by the winter that troubled them, they determined
to return back again. <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">The bold act of Flavius Gallus.</note>The

the rumour was, that there were not much fewer than 40,000

might be partners of the spoil and booty they hoped to have

to fight, but to spoil and make havoc of all, when they came

such other javelins as the Romans darted at them, and the Parthians found them as rough and desperate in fight, as if they
had been fresh men they had dealt withal.     Whereupon their
hearts began again to fail them.  But yet when the Romans
came to go down any steep hills or mountains, they would set
on them with their arrows, because the Romans could go down

the Romans suddenly rose upon their feet, and with the darts
that they threw from them they slew the foremost, and put the

there was one that killed them, and made them out of their wits.

was the only sovereign remedy to cure that disease. It is

saying, that themselves also did return home to their country as
they did, and that they would follow them no farther: howbeit
that they should yet have certain Medes that would follow them
a day's journey or two, to keep them that they should do no hurt
to the villages from the high-ways; and so holding them with
this talk, they gently took their leave of them, and bad them
farewell, so that the Romans began again to think themselves
safe. Antonius also understanding this, being very glad of it,
determined to take his way through the plain country, because
also they should find no water in the mountains, as it was
reported unto him.

into his host one Mithridates, a gentleman from the enemies'
camp, who was cousin unto Moneses that fled unto Antonius,
and unto whom he had given three cities. When he came to
Antonius' camp, he prayed them to bring him one that could
speak the Parthian or Syrian tongue. So one Alexander Antiochian,
a familiar of Antonius, was brought unto him. Then the
gentleman told him what he was, and said that Moneses had
sent him to Antonius, to requite the honour and courtesy he had
shewed unto him. After he had used this ceremonious speech,
he asked Alexander if he saw those high mountains afar off,
which he pointed unto with his finger. Alexander answered he
did. "The Parthians," said he, "do lie in ambush at the foot of
those mountains, under the which lieth a goodly plain <term>champion</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">flat and open</note>

<milestone n="47" unit="para"/>So Mithridates having said, he departed. Antonius was marvellously
troubled in his mind when he heard thus much, and
therefore called for his friends, to hear what they would say to
it. The Mardian also that was their -guide, being asked his
opinion, answered that he thought as much as the gentleman
Mithridates had said. "For," said he, "admit that there were
no ambush of enemies in the valley, yet it is a long crooked way,

it did gnaw the guts of those that had drunk it, and made them
marvellous dry, and put them into a terrible ache and pricking.
And notwithstanding that the Mardian had told them of it before,
yet they would not be ruled, but violently thrust them back
that would have kept them from drinking, and so drank. But

Mithridates before-named returned again as before, and Alexander

Then Mithridates advised him, that after the army had reposed

sword through him when he would bid him, and cut off his head,
because he might not be taken alive of his enemies, nor known
when he were dead. This grieved his friends to the heart, that
they burst out a-weeping for sorrow. The Mardian also did
comfort him, and assured him that the river he sought for was
hard by) and that he did guess it by a sweet moist wind that
breathed upon them, and by the air which they found fresher
than they were wont, and also, for that they fetched their

more at liberty; and moreover, because that since they did set
forward, he thought they were near their journey's end, not lacking
much of day. On the other side also Antonius was informed
that this great tumult and trouble came not through the enemies,
but through the vile covetousness and villany of certain of his
soldiers. Therefore Antonius, to set his army again in order,

drive back the enemies, and first of all) got over his men that
were sick and hurt, and afterwards all the rest. And those also
that were left to resist the enemies had leisure enough to drink
safely and at their pleasure.  For when the Parthians saw the
river, they unbent their bows, and bad the Romans pass over
without any fear, and greatly commended their valiantness.
When they had all passed over the river at their ease, they took
a little breath, and so marched forward again, not greatly trusting
the Parthians. <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Araxes fl.</note>The sixth day after this last battle, they

And furthermore there ran a rumour through the camp, that the
<pb n="198"/>

Parthians lay in ambush thereabouts, and that they would come
and set upon them whilst they were troubled in passing over
the river. But now, after they were all come safely over without
any danger, and that they had gotten to the other side, into the
province of Armenia, then they worshipped that land, as if it had
been the first land they had seen after a long and dangerous
voyage by sea, being now arrived in a safe and happy haven:
and the tears ran down their cheeks, and every man embraced
each other for the great joy they had. But now, keeping the
fields in this fruitful country so plentiful of all things, after so
great a famine and want of all things, they so crammed themselves
with such plenty of victuals, that many of them were cast
into fluxes and dropsies. <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Eighteen several battles fought with the Parthians.</note>

which had not all been slain by their enemies: for the

days' journey coming from the city of Phraata into Armenia, and
having overcome the Parthians in eighteen several battles. But
these victories were not throughly performed nor accomplished,
because they followed no long chase: and thereby it easily appeared,
that Artabazus king of Armenia had kept Antonius from
ending this war. For if the sixteen thousand 
horsemen which
he brought with him out of Media had been at these battles
'considering that they were armed and apparelled 
much after
the Parthian manner, and acquainted also with their fight, when
the Romans had put them to flight that had fought a battle with
them, and that these Armenians had followed the chase of them

neither durst they also have returned to fight with them so often

no less afraid than also in danger to lose his whole realm. <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Wars betwixt the Parthians and Medes.</note>Thereupon

(which made him he could not overcome the Parthians, meaning
that he had not brought horsemen, and men with darts and
slings enough) was offered him in that sort, that it did him more
pleasure to accept it than it was pleasure to the other to offer it.
Hereupon, after he had spoken with the king of Medes at the

his friends and captains he had about him: and besides all
those, she had 2000 soldiers, chosen men, all well armed like

whom he had sent unto Athens, had brought these news from
his wife Octavia, and withal did greatly praise her, as she was
worthy and well deserved, Cleopatra, knowing that Octavia
would have Antonius from her, and fearing also that if with her
virtue and honest behaviour (besides the great power of her
brother Caesar) she did add "hereunto her modest kind love to
please her husband, that she would then be too strong for her,
and in the end win him away: she subtly seemed to languish
for the love of Antonius, pining her body for lack of meat. Furthermore,
she every way so framed her countenance, that when
Antonius came to see her, she cast her eyes upon him, like a
woman ravished for joy. Straight again when he went from her,
she fell a-weeping and blubbering, looking ruefully on the matter,

would see a poor lady in such torment for his sake, whose life
depended only upon him alone. "For Octavia," said they,
" that was married unto him as it were of necessity, because her

                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">deceived</note> her. Octavia answered
him again, that she would not forsake her husband's house, and
that if he had no other occasion to make war with him, she
prayed him then to take no thought for her: '` For," said she, "it
were too shameful a thing, that two so famous captains should
bring in civil wars among the Romans, the one for the love of a
woman, and the other for the jealousy betwixt one another.''
Now as she spake the word, so did she also perform the deed:
for she kept still in Antonius' house, as if he had been there, and
very honestly and honourably kept his children, not only those
she had by him, but the other which her husband had by Fulvia.
Furthermore, when Antonius sent any of his men to Rome, to
sue for any office in the commonwealth, she received them very
courteously, and so used herself unto her brother, that she obtained
the things she requested. Howbeit thereby, thinking no
hurt, she did Antonius great hurt. For her honest love and
regard to her husband made every man hate him, when they
saw he did so unkindly use so noble a lady: but the greatest
cause of their malice unto him was for the division of lands he
made among his children in the city of Alexandria. <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Antonius arrogantly divideth diverse provinces unto his children by Cleopatra.</note>And, to

ancient kings and successors of Alexander the Great. So after
his sons had done their humble duties,-and kissed their father
and mother, presently a company of Armenian soldiers, set
there of purpose, compassed the one about, and a like company
of Macedonians the other. Now for Cleopatra, she did not
only wear at that time (but at all other times else when she
came abroad) the apparel of the goddess Isis, and so gave audience
unto all her subjects! as a new Isis.

the conquests he had made by force of arms, he was contented

by chance coming through the market-place in her litter where
Furnius was a-pleading, Antonius straight rose out of his seat,
and left his audience to follow her litter. 

<milestone n="59" unit="para"/>This notwithstanding,
it was thought Calvisius devised the most part of all these accusations
 of his own head. <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Geminius sent from Rome to Antonius, to bid him take heed to himself.</note>Nevertheless they that loved Antonius

 of Rome. This Geminius, being arrived in Greece, made Cleopatra
jealous straight of his coming, because she surmised that he
came not but to speak for Octavia. Therefore she spared not
to taunt him all supper-time; and moreover, to spite him the
more, she made him to be set lowest of all at the board: the which
he took patiently, <term>expecting</term>

Now Antonius commanding him at the table to tell him what
wind brought him thither, he answered, 'That it was no tabletalk,
and that he would tell him to-morrow morning fasting: but
drunk or fasting, howsoever it were, he was sure of one thing,
that all would not go well on his side, unless Cleopatra were
sent back into Egypt.' Antonius took these words in very ill
part. Cleopatra on the other side answered him, "Thou doest
well, Geminius," said she, "to tell the truth before thou be compelled
by torments'' but within few days after, Geminius stole
away, and fled to Rome. <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Many of Antonius' friends do forsake him.</note>The flatterers also, to please Cleopatra,
did make her drive many other of Antonius' faithful servants

because her physician Glaucus told him that Cleopatra had set
some secretly to kill him. Furthermore, he had Cleopatra's displeasure,

he proclaimed open war against Cleopatra, and made the

had before given it up unto a woman. And Caesar said furthermore,
that Antonius was not master of himself, but that Cleopatra
had brought him beside himself by her charms and amorous
poisons: and that they, that should make war with them, should
be Mardian the eunuch, Photinus, and Iras (a woman of

                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">desire</note> him to delay no more time, but to

would give him safe harbour to land without any trouble; and
that he would withdraw his army from the sea, as far as one
horse could run, until he had put his army ashore, and had
lodged his men. Antonius on the other side bravely sent
him word again and challenged the combat of him, man
for man, though he were the elder; and that if he refused
him so, he would then fight a battle with him in the fields
of Pharsalia, as Julius Caesar and Pompey had done before.
Now whilst Antonius rode at anchor, lying idly in harbour
at the head of Actium, in the place where the city of Nicopolis
standeth at this present, Caesar had quickly passed the sea
Ionium and taken a place called Toryne, before Antonius understood
7 that he had taken ship. Then began his men to be afraid,
because his army by land was left behind. But Cleopatra making
light of it, "And what danger, I pray you," said she, " if Caesar

                  <note resp="trans" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">The grace of this taunt cannot properly be expressed in any other tongue because of the equivocation of this word Toryne, which signifieth a city of Albania, and also a ladle to scum the pot with: as if she meant, Caesar sat by the fire-side scumming of the pot.</note>?"

<milestone n="63" unit="para"/>The next morning by break of day, his
enemies coming with full force of oars in battle against him,
Antonius was afraid that if they came to join, they would take
and carry away his ships that had no men of war in them. So
he armed all his water-men, and set them in order of battle
upon the forecastle of their ships, and then

<pb n="209"/>

so kept them in order of battle, as if they had been armed and
furnished with water-men and soldiers. Thus Octavius Caesar,
being finely deceived by this stratagem, retired presently, and
therewithal Antonius very wisely and suddenly did cut him
off from fresh water. For, understanding that the places ``here
Octavius Caesar landed had very little store of water, and yet
very bad, he shut them in with strong ditches and trenches he
cast, to keep them from sailing out at their pleasure, and so to
go seek water farther off. <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Domitius forsaketh Antonius and goeth unto Octavius Caesar.</note>Furthermore, he dealt very friendly

                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">baggage</note>, train, and men: and
the same Domitius, as though he gave him to understand that
he repented his open treason, died immediately after. <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Amyntas and Deiotarus do both revolt from Antonius and go unto Caesar.</note>There
were certain kings also that forsook him, and turned on Caesar's
side, as Amyntas and Deiotarus. Furthermore, his fleet and
navy that was unfortunate in all things, and unready for service,
compelled him to change his mind, and to hazard battle by
land. And Canidius also, who had charge of his army by land,
when time came to follow Antonius' determination, he 
turned
him clean contrary, and counselled him to send Cleopatra back
again, and himself to retire into Macedon, to fight there on the
main land. And furthermore told him, that Dicomes king of
the Getes promised to aid him with a great power: and that it
should be no shame nor dishonour to him to let Caesar have the I
sea, because himself and his men both had been well practiced
and exercised in battles by sea, in the war of Sicilia against
Sextus Pompeius: but rather that he should do against all
reason (he having so great skill and experience of battles by
land as he had), if he should not employ the force and 
valiantness of so many lusty armed footmen as he had ready, but
would weaken his army by dividing them into ships. But now,
notwithstanding all these good persuasions, Cleopatra forced
him to put all to the hazard of battle by sea: considering with
herself how she might fly and provide for her safety, not to help
him to win the victory, but to fly more easily after the battle lost.
Betwixt Antonius' camp and his fleet of ships, there was a great
high point of firm land that ran a good way into the sea, the
which Antonius used often for a walk, without mistrust of fear
or danger. One of Caesar's men perceived it, and told his
master that he would laugh if they could take up Antonius in

<milestone n="64" unit="para"/>So when Antonius had determined to fight by sea, he set all the
other ships on fire but three score ships of Egypt, and reserved
only the best and greatest galleys, from three banks unto ten
banks of oars Into them he put two and twenty thousand
fighting men, with two thousand darters and slingers. Now as
he was setting his men in order of battle, there was a captain, a
valiant man, that had served Antonius in many battles and conflicts,
and had all his body hacked and cut: who, as Antonius
passed by him, cried out unto him, and said: "O noble emperor,
how cometh it to pass that you trust to these vile brittle
ships? What, do you mistrust these wounds of mine, and this
sword? Let the Egyptians and Phoenicians fight by sea, and set

people to encourage them to fight valiantly, as if they were on
main land, because of the steadiness and heaviness of their
ships: and commanded the pilots and masters of the galleys,
that they should not stir, none otherwise than if they were at
anchor, and so to receive the first charge of their enemies, and
<pb n="211"/>

that they should not go out of the

                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">that is to say.</note>, Fortunate: and his

had won the battle, setting out the market-place with the spurs
of the galleys he had taken, for a sign of his victory, he caused
also the man and his ass to be set up in brass. When he had
visited the order of his army throughout, he took a little pinnace,
and went to the right wing, and wondered when he saw his
enemies lie still in the

                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">strait, channel.</note>, and stirred not. For discerning I
them afar off, men would have thought they had been ships
riding at anchor: and a good while he was so persuaded. So he
kept his galleys eight furlongs from his enemies. About noon
there arose a little gale of wind from the sea, and then Antonius'
men, waxing angry with tarrying so long, and trusting to the
greatness and height of their ships, as if they had been invincible,
they began to march forward with their left wing. Caesar,
seeing that, was a glad man, and began a little to give back
from the right wing, to allure them to come farther out of the

<milestone n="66" unit="para"/>When the
skirmish began, and that they came to join, there was no great
hurt at the first meeting, neither did the ships vehemently hit
one against the other, as they do commonly in fight by sea. For
on the other side Antonius' ships, for their heaviness, could not
have the strength and swiftness to make their blows of any
force: and Caesar's ships on the other side took great heed not
to rush and shock with the forecastles of Antonius' ships, whose
prows were armed with great brazen spurs. Furthermore they
durst not flank them, because their points were easily broken,
which way soever they came to set upon his ships, that were
made of great main square pieces of timber, bound together
with great iron pins: so that the battle was much like unto a
battle by land, or to speak more properly, to the assault of a
city. For there were always three or four of Caesar's ships
about one of Antonius' ships, and the soldiers fought with their
pikes, 
<term>halbards</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">halberds.</note> and darts, and threw halbards and darts with
fire. Antonius' ships on the other side bestowed among them,
<pb n="212"/>

 with their crossbows and engines of battery, great store of shot
from their high towers of wood that were set upon their ships.
Now Publicola seeing Agrippa put forth his left wing of Caesar's
army, to compass in Antonius' ships that fought, he was driven
also to

Cleopatra was: howbeit he saw her not at his first coming, nor

and said never a word, clapping his head between both his
hands. In the meantime came certain light brigantines of

ship, and asked him what he was that durst follow Antonius so
near? " I am," answered he, "Eurycles the son of Lachares,
who through Caesar's good fortune seeketh to revenge the death
of my father." This Lachares was condemned of felony, and

beheaded by Antonius. But yet Eurycles durst not venture
upon Antonius' ship, but set upon the other admiral galley (for
there were two), and fell upon him with such a blow of his
brazen spur that was so heavy and big, that he turned her
round, and took her, with another that was

there Cleopatra's women first brought Antonius and Cleopatra

of Athens, that lived about the war of Peloponnesus, as appeareth
by Plato and Aristophanes' comedies: in the which
they mocked him, calling him a viper and malicious man unto
mankind, to shun all other men's companies but the company
of young Alcibiades, a bold and insolent youth, whom he would
greatly feast and make much of, and kissed him very gladly.
Apemantus wondering at it, asked him the cause

to make so much of that young man alone, and to hate all
others: Timon answered him, " I do it," said he, "because I
know that one day he shall do great mischief unto the Athenians." 
This Timon sometimes would have Apemantus in his
company, because he was much like of his nature and conditions,
and also followed him in manner of life. On a time when
they solemnly celebrated the feast called Choe at Athens (to
wit, the feasts of the dead where they make sprinklings and

 sacrifices for the dead) and that they two then feasted together
by themselves, Apemantus said unto the other: " O, here is a

he, " so thou wert not here." It is reported of him also, that
this Timon on a time (the people being assembled in the marI;et-place about dispatch of some affairs) got up into the pulpit

what he would say, because it was a wonder to see him in that
place, at length he began to speak in this manner: " My lords

a fig-tree, on the which many citizens have hanged themselves:
and because I mean to make some building on the place, I

was buried upon the sea-side. Now it chanced so, that the sea
getting in, it compassed his tomb round about, that no man
could come to it: and upon the same was written this epitaph:

It is reported that Timon himself, when he lived, made this
epitaph: for that which is commonly rehearsed was not his,
but made by the poet Callimachus:

Here lie I, Timon, who alive all living men did

thought thereby to hasten his death. When he had drunk, he
earnestly prayed her, and persuaded her, that she would seek
to save her life, if she could possible, without reproach and dishonour:
and that chiefly she should trust Proculeius above any
man else about Caesar. And as for himself, that she should
not lament nor sorrow for the miserable change of his fortune
at the end of his days: but rather that she should think him
the more fortunate, for the former triumphs and honours he had
received; considering that while he lived, he was the noblest
and greatest prince of the world; and that now he was overcome,
not cowardly, but valiantly, a Roman by another Roman.

Caesar, and next unto the children of Livia, which were the

daughter. Caesar first was contented withal, and then Agrippa:
and so she afterwards took away her daughter and married her

married unto Drusus, the son of Livia, and son-in-law of Caesar.
Of this marriage came Germanicus and

                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">Claudius</note>: of the which,

emperor: who after he had licentiously reigned a time, was
slain, with his wife and daughter. Agrippina also (having a son
by her first husband Aenobarbus, called Lucius Domitius) was
afterwards married unto Clodius, who adopted her son, and
called him Nero Germanicus. This Nero was emperor in our
time, who slew his own mother, and had almost destroyed the
empire of Rome through his madness and wicked life, being the
fifth emperor of Rome after Antonius.</p>

                  <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">The descent of Augustus.</note>Accia, 
the daughter of Accius Balbus and of Julia the
sister of Julius Caesar, was married unto the father of this man,
whose life we write of now, and who was descended of the ancient
race of the Octavians, issued out of the country of the
Volsces, and known at Rome from the time of Tarquinius, and
of Servius Tullus. Their son Octavius was born in the year of
the consulship of Cicero and of Caius Antonius, <term>at that time
when as</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">when that, when.</note> the conspiracy 
of Catiline was discovered and suppressed.
He was called Thurinus: but afterwards, according to
the tenor of his uncle's testament, who made him his heir, he
was called Caius Julius Caesar, and lastly Augustus, by the advice 
<pb n="231"/>

of Munatius Plancus, and by the decree of the Senate. He
was but four years old when his father died, and at twelve years
he made the funeral oration for his grandmother Julia: four years
after that, he became a gownman, though he were but young:
yet his uncle gave him a present at his return out of Africa,
such as the soldiers are accustomed to have of their captains.
Shortly after he followed his uncle into Spain, whither he was
gone against the children of Pompey, and passed through many
great dangers to overtake him. This war being ended, because
Caesar undertook other longer journeys, Octavius was sent into
the city of Apollonia:<note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Augustus studiedat Apollonia.</note>
and there <term>plied</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">studied</note> his book very diligently.
And it chanced him, without having any mind to it, that, being
gone to see Theogenes a learned astronomer, he cast his nativity;
and suddenly he leapt, being amazed, and honoured him.
The which made Octavius conceive great hope of himself, and
in memory of this good hap he caused certain pieces of money
to be coined, and he himself told the opinion of Theogenes.
Being returned from Apollonia to Rome, after his uncle was
slain by Cassius, Brutus, and their allies, he declared himself to
be his heir, <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Augustus declared himself heir to Julius Caesar.</note>
though his mother and Marcius Philippus were of
another mind. <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Augustus ruled alone 44 years.</note>
And having put himself forward, he governed
the commonwealth of Rome, first with Antonius and Lepidus,
afterwards with Antonius, the space of twelve years: and lastly
himself alone, the space of four and forty years. But before we
speak of his government of common affairs in time of peace and
war, let us say somewhat (after Suetonius) of his family and his
manners. He married being yet very young the daughter of
Publius Servilius Isauricus: but having made peace with Antonius
after the war of <term>Mutine</term>,<note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">Mutina.</note>
and at the request of their armies,
who were desirous to see them friends, he married with Clodia,
the daughter of Publius Clodius and of Fulvia then wife of Antonius.
But before he knew her, he sent her to her mother,
with whom he was somewhat discontented, and because of the
war of <term>Perouse.</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">Perusia</note>
Immediately he married Scribonia, and kept
not her long, because she was too troublesome: yet he had a
daughter by her called Julia.
<note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Augustus forsaking his wives married Livia, whom he loved to the end.</note>
But forsaking her, he took another
which he loved unto the end: and that was Livia Drusilla,
the wife of Tiberius Nero, whom he carried with him great with
child as she was, and had no more children by her but one, and
yet she went not out her time, and it had no life. His daughter
Julia was married unto Marcellus, the son of his sister Octavia:
and after his death unto Marcus Agrippa, by whom she had
<pb n="232"/>

three sons, Caius, Lucius, and Agrippa: and two daughters,
Julia and <term>Agrippine.</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">Agrippina.</note> 
After the death of Marcus Agrippa, he
chose for his son-in-law Tiberius, the son of Tiberius Nero and
Livia Drusilla, at that time a knight of Rome, and compelled
him to forsake his wife Vipsamia, of whom he had a son called
Drusus.<note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Augustus unfortunate in his posterity.</note>
But as he was fortunate in managing the affairs of the
commonwealth, so was he unfortunate in his race: for his
daughter and his niece Julia committed so foul faults in Rome,
that he was constrained to banish them. Agrippine1 was married
unto Germanicus, the son of his sister's daughter. Caius
and Lucius died in less than a year and a half one after
another: whereupon he adopted his nephew Agrippa, and his
son-in-law Tiberius. But because Agrippa was of a churlish
nature and <term>unhonest,</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">dishonourable</note>
he did disinherit him, and confined him
to Surrentum. His niece Julia had a child after she was
banished, but he would not know it, nor suffer it should be
brought up.

                  <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Augustus' manners in his private life.</note>
He was very modest and continent in all the parts of his
life, saving that he was somewhat given to women and play: for
the rest, he liked not great palaces, but was contented with
mean lodgings: and if there were any ornament, it was in
porches and parks. His household-stuff and apparel was <term>nothing</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">in no way</note>
sumptuous nor costly. It pleased him well to make feasts; he
very carefully made choice of his guests, and oftentimes he sat
down at the table a long time after everybody, and would rise
before others, which remained after he was up. In his ordinary
diet he banished superfluity of meats, he delighted to be merry
and pleasant among his friends, or to bring in pleasant players
of comedies to pass the time away. And he did not tie himself
to any certain hours to eat his meat, but when his stomach
served him he took something. So that sometimes he supped
not at all, and then, when every man was gone, he made them
bring him meat, neither dainty nor delicate. Also he <term>drunk</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">drank</note>
very little wine; he slept in the day, and by times in the night,
talking with some or reading: so that oftentimes he slept not till
the break of day, and, for that he took no rest in the night, he
might chance to sleep in his litter as they carried him in the
streets in the daytime up and down in Rome. He was a goodly
prince, and that kept himself in good state from the beginning
of his life to the latter end: not curious to set himself out, as
little caring to be shaven as to wear long hair: and instead of a
looking-glass, reading in his book or writing, even whilst the
<pb n="233"/>

barber was trimming of him. Whether he spake or held his
peace, he had so comely a face, that many of his enemies, bent
to do him hurt, their hearts would not serve them so soon as ever
they looked on him. He had very clear and lively eyes, but
with <term>time</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">in the course of time.</note>
he was subject to many diseases and infirmities, the
which he remedied with great care. <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">What exercises Augustus used.</note>
As for his exercises, he left arms and horses immediately after the civil wars: for he was
never any great soldier. He would play at tennis, at the <term>ballone,</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">a game now called pallone.</note>
he would go abroad in his coach to walk and stir himself.
Sometimes he would go a-fishing, or play at the bones, or at
nuts, with young children of the Moors and Syrians that had
some pretty manner and behaviour with them, and always spake
words to move laughter. He was learned in the liberal sciences,
very eloquent, and desirous to learn: insomuch that during the
war of <term>Mutine,</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">Mutina.</note>
in the midst of all his infinite affairs, he did read,
he wrote, and made orations amongst his familiars. He never
spake unto the Senate nor people, nor to his soldiers, but he
had first written and premeditated that he would say unto them,
although he had speech at commandment, to propound or answer
to anything in the field. And because he would not deceive his
memory, or lose time in superfluous speech, he determined ever
to write all that he would say: and he was the first inventor of
it. If he had to confer with any man, or with his wife in any
matters of importance, he would put that down in his writing tables,
because he would speak neither more nor less. And he
took pleasure to pronounce his words with a sweet voice and
good grace, having continually about him for this purpose a fine
man to frame his voice. But one day having a pain in his
mouth, he made his oration to the people by an herald. He
made many books and verses of divers sorts; but all is dead
with the time. His speech was as the rest of his life, eloquent,
well couched together, and sententious. He delighted to read
good authors, but he gathered nothing other than the sentences
teaching good manners: and having written them out word by
word, he gave out a copy of them to his familiars: and sent
them about to the governors of provinces, and to the magistrates
of Rome and of other cities. He was somewhat, and too
much, given to divinations; he was marvellously afraid of thunder
and lightning; he had a great confidence in dreams, and in
such like vanities. But peradventure we are too curious searching
out his private life: yet that may sometime discover great
personages more than their public actions, in the which they are
<pb n="234"/>

more careful to frame their countenances, and do counterfeit
most.

                  <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Augustus' memorable acts done while he reigned.</note>
Now, as we have lightly run over his private life before
spoken of, so shall the memorable deeds done by his authority
be briefly represented: being <term>unpossible</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">impossible</note>
to comprehend in a few lines so many notable things, unless a man would make a great
book of them. This is to be noted in him, that so young a man,
having so small beginnings, coming out of a mean house in
comparison of others, hath exceed all other young and old men
in wisdom and greatness of courage; should rise so high, that
before he had been praetor the Senate gave him the name of Augustus,
created him master of the horse, when as yet he never
had charge of a company of men-at-arms: proclaimed him emperor
and sovereign captain, <term>afore</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">before</note>
he had been placed in any public office by authority of the Senate. Furthermore, for the
first time he was chosen consul when he was but twenty years
old: and he was thirteen times consul, and twenty times called
sovereign captain. Afterwards, when he was not yet four and
thirty years old, the Senate and people of Rome gave him this
goodly name of father of his country, because he had maintained
and preserved the commonwealth. It is a wonderful
thing that he could wind himself out of so many great affairs
and wars, that he could, within four and twenty years of age,
restore again into so good estate the commonwealth of Rome,
turmoiled and troubled with so many proscriptions and civil
wars as it was. And that afterwards, so long as he commanded
alone, he did so firmly establish this monarchy, that notwithstanding
the infinite troubles received under other emperors, yet
it stood upright and in so great prosperity for so many hundred
years. After the death of Julius Caesar, this man, being but
bare eighteen years old, came to Rome, where he was welcomed,
and immediately did contest with Antonius, hated of Cicero
and of many others: from whence the advancement of this
young Caesar came, and the declaration of the war against Antonius,
judged an enemy of the commonwealth, and overcome
by the consuls Hirtius and Pansa. Caesar, who was their associate,
was called sovereign captain, though he had not yet
fought: both the consuls being dead of their hurts. But the
Senate, after this overthrow, beginning to change their mind, he,
perceiving that they were slow to grant him the consulship,
resolved to possess it by force of arms, and began to acquaint
himself with Antonius and Lepidus, which were joined together.
<pb n="235"/>

He made that the soldiers promised by oath the one to the
other, that they would fight against none of Caesar's <term>troups,</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">troops</note>
and sent 400 men to Rome to ask for him, in the name of all
the army, the office of consul. They having delivered their
charge unto the Senate, Cornelius the <term>centiner,</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">centurion.</note> chief of this legation
or ambassade, perceiving they would give him no present
answer, casting up his cassock and strewing the Senate the pommel
of his sword, said unto them: "This shall do it, if you will
not do it." So they being returned without obtaining their demand,
Caesar made Antonius and Lepidus come into Italy, and
he for his part having passed the river of Rubicon, marched
with eight legions right to Rome.
<note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Augustus obtaineth the consulship by force of arms.</note>
This put all Rome in such a fear, as they sent to Caesar to present him the consulship: and
twice so much in gift as they had promised the legions. Now
whilst the ambassadors were on their way, the senators beginning
again to take heart to them, encouraged by the arrival of
the legions of Africa, they determined to try all means before
they would betray the liberty of their country, being minded to
call back that which they had sent to Caesar, and so disposed
themselves to make war. Caesar, being offended with this inconstancy,
sent certain horsemen before to assure the people that
he would make no tumult at all: he drew his legions near, and
made himself lord of Rome without one stroke stricken: and
contrariwise, the people and Senate received him with shew
of great joy. Then, in the assembly of all the people, he was
chosen consul, just at the full accomplishment of twenty years of
his age. So he demanded in the field that they should proceed
criminally against those that had killed his father Caesar.
Q. Pedius, his fellow-consul, published the decree. So were
Brutus and Cassius and all their friends condemned, with interdiction
of water and fire. But forasmuch as Augustus had too
small means to set upon Brutus and Cassius, he reconciled Antonius
and Lepidus with the Senate, and made alliance with
them, followed with great armies. They joined, and were in
consultation of their affairs the space of three days together,
near unto Bolonia, or unto <term>Mutine:</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">Mutina.</note> and as if the Roman empire
had been their own inheritance, they divided it between them
three. So that Caesar had the high and <term>base</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">low</note> Lybia, with Sicilia
and Sardinia. Spain and Gaul Narbonense fell unto Lepidus:
and the rest of Gaul was for Antonius.
<note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Augustus, Lepidus, and Antonius joint rulers.</note>
They did decree also that they should be called Triumviri, appointed for the re-establishment
of the commonwealth, with sovereign authority for
<pb n="236"/>

five years, to dispose and give the estates and offices to whom
they thought good, without asking advice of the Senate or
people. So they established Lepidus consul for the year following,
in the place of Decimus Brutus that was killed: and they
gave him the guard of Rome and Italy, so long as they two that
remained made their preparations to go against Brutus and
Cassius. Besides the presents they should make unto the soldiers
after the victory, they promised to give them leave to ease
themselves, and eighteen rich towns in Italy for them to dwell
in. Then they began to <term>set up</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">publish</note> a roll of all the citizens of
Rome appointed by them to be slain. And they decreed to
every free man that should bring the Triumviri a head of the
proscripts, the sum of two thousand five hundred crowns, and
half so much unto the slaves with enfranchisement: and the
like sum also to whosoever could discover any man that had
hidden or favoured the proscripts. <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Antonius and Lepidus authors of a bloody tragedy.</note>Antonius and Lepidus were

Cicero was not forgotten, as we may see in his life: and it
would be very hard to describe the wickedness of that time,
the which like a furious stream carried away so many citizens of
Rome. In whose history do appear most rare examples of all
sorts of vices and virtues in all manner of persons; of whom
we will make mention, after those that have written more at

So they did set up the names of the proscripts fastened
in divers places of Rome, to the number of an hundred and
thirty senators for the first time, a hundred and fifty at the
second time, and two thousand knights. Then was the gate
open to all villanies and cruelties, fought withal by patience and
fidelity: but the examples will shew that better than all the discourse
a man can make. Salvius Otho, tribune of the people,
was one of the first: who having invited his friends to his last
supper, a <term>centener</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">centurion</note> came in, and in the presence of all his guests,
half dead for fear, <term>strake</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">struck</note> off his head. Minutius the praetor
was also killed, sitting in his seat of judgment. L. Villius Annalis,
a man that had been consul, being escaped out of the
hands of the murtherers, saved himself in the suburbs in a little
house of one of his clients: but his own son, having no patience
to stay for the inheritance of his father, <term>bewrayed</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">betrayed</note> him unto
the soldiers, who went to kill him there. <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Two parricides justly punished.</note>
Shortly after this parricide, being drunk, had a quarrel with the self-same soldiers,
who <term>stabbed him in</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">stabbed him mortally.</note>
with their daggers. C. Toranius was betrayed
in like manner by his own son, who having consumed in
a few days the succession which he had so execrably pursued,
and being condemned for theft, was banished into a place
where he died for want and poverty. <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">A good son.</note>
Now against these wicked,let us set some virtuous children. Q. Cicero was hid by his
son, whom they could never make confess (though he was tormented) 
where his father was: who, not able any longer to endure
they should afflict so virtuous a son with so many evils for
his sake, came and presented himself to the murtherers. The
son began to intreat them to kill him before his father: but they
were both killed at one time. The Egnaces, father and son,
one embracing the other, were both run through and slain at
one blow. C. Hosidius Geta was buried for dead by his son:
who saved him, sustained, and kept him till it was peace. Arruntius,
after he had comforted and strengthened his son, put
himself to the swords of the murtherers. The son died immediately
after for grief and famine. Some other children carefully
saved and kept their fathers, and hid them.
<note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Women: some faithful to their husbands, others unfaithful.</note>
Certain women also shewed themselves marvellous faithful and loving
to their husbands: and so were there, to the contrary, some
<pb n="238"/>

unfaithful, that discovered their wonderful wickedness. Tanusia
made such earnest suit, that she obtained grace of Caesar for
T. Junius her husband, who was hidden by Philopoemen, his
bondman enfranchised; whom Caesar knighted for his fidelity to
his master. Q. Ligarius, having been kept by his wife, was discovered
by a slave, and killed: wherefore his wife killed herself
with famine. Lucretius Vespillo, having <term>erred</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">wandered.</note> and run in great
danger here and there, not knowing whither to fly, came secretly
to his wife Thuria, and was hidden and kept close betwixt
the <term>seeling</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">ceiling.</note> and the top of the house, until she had obtained his
grace of the Triumviri. Apuleius was saved by his wife, who
fled with him. The wife of Antius wrapped up her husband in
coverlets, and made him be carried to the sea as a packet of
stuff, where he <term>imbarked,</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">embarked.</note> and sailed into Sicilia. Coponius was
saved by his wife, who put her honour aside in respect of her
husband's life: for she lent her body one night unto Antonius to
preserve him (which she did by that means) whom she loved
better than herself. Now to the contrary, some women, unfaithful
to their husbands, delivered them into the hands of the murtherers,
because they might marry again. Amongst other, the
wife of Septimius, having shamefully given her body unto one of
Antonius' familiars, she caused her husband to be put in the
number of the proscripts, that she might more easily continue
her adultery: and so was Septimius put to death. Q. Vettius
Salassus was hidden in a sure privy place, wherewith he acquainted
his wife; but she straight revealed him to the murtherers.
The which he perceiving, from a high place where he
was, cast himself down headlong, choosing rather to die so,
than to make his cruel wife pastime. Fulvius was discovered
by a slave of his and his concubine, jealous because he had
married a wife, and had left her; although notwithstanding he
had made her free, and had given her goods to live withal.
<note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Enfranchised slaves: some treacherous, some true.</note>
Now let us presently speak of the faithfulness and unfaithfulness
of slaves enfranchised. P. Naso was betrayed by his slave
freed, with whom he had been too familiar. But he sold his
death, for he killed the traitor with his own hands, and afterwards
held out his neck to the hangman. L. Lucceius had put
into the hands of two of his slaves <term>manumissed</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">manumitted, freed.</note>
as much as was necessary to have relieved him in his banishment: but they
ran away with all, and he came and put himself to the slaughter.
Haterius, that was in a secret place, was sold and discovered
by a slave of his. Cassius Varus, being bewrayed by a freeman
<pb n="239"/>

that was his slave, escaped nevertheless, and hid himself among
reeds: where being found by those of <term>Minturnes,</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">Minturnae</note>
they took him for a thief, and would have racked him to have
<term>bewrayed</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">betrayed</note>
his companions: he discovered himself to be a senator of Rome,
but they would not believe him, because he was in poor estate.
But whilst they were reasoning of the matter, there cometh a
<term>centener</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">centurion</note>
                  <term>that strake</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">struck</note>
off his head. C. Plotius was saved by his
slaves: but being a man given to perfume and rub himself with
odoriferous ointments, the <term>sent</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">scent.</note> and smell of them discovered
him to the soldiers, that went <term>ferriting</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">searching</note> up and down in his
house: yet could they not find him, but cruelly tormented his
servants, to make them confess where he was: which they would
never do. But Plotius, having compassion of the evils of his
faithful slaves, came out of the place where he was hidden; and
because he would prolong their life, he shortened his own, and
presented himself to the murtherers. Appius Claudius, as he
was near to be had by the back, changed his gown with his
slave, who went in that sort to present himself to the murtherers:
but they took off his head, and so he saved his master's
head. <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Some enfranchised men give their own lives to save their masters.</note>
Another slave of Menenius did the like: for he went
into his master's litter, and offered his neck to the sword of the
murtherers: who despatched him whilst his master got to the
port of the sea, from whence he escaped into Sicilia. But the
slave of Urbinus Panopio is worthy of memory everywhere: for
he, hearing the murtherers came to <term>sack</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">plunder.</note> his master, took his
master's gown from him and his ring, gave him his own, and
put him out at the back-gate. Then he goeth up into his master's
chamber, and lay down upon his bed, where he boldly
<term>attended</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">plunder</note> them, that killed him for Panopio. Another shewed
himself no less faithful in the behalf of Antius Restio: for although
his master had throughly thwacked him for his knavish
tricks played a few days before, and that then it seemeth he
had opportunity to be revenged; he to the contrary employed
himself after a marvellous fashion to save his master: for he,
meeting with an old man in his journey, <term>strake</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">struck.</note> off his head;
and strewing that, with his whippings together, to the murtherers,
he made them easily believe that he had been well revenged
of his master, with whom immediately after he saved himself in
Sicilia. The slaves of Martius Censorinus kept him a long
time, and so well, that he had leisure to go to Sextus Pompeius.
Q. Oppius, an honourable old man, and being almost at the pit's
brink, like to be killed, was rescued by his son, who having
<pb n="240"/>

                  <term>finely</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">cleverly.</note> gotten him out of Rome, took him upon his shoulders,
and afterwards led him into Sicilia, where all the poor distressed
Romans were gently received. <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Sextus Pompeius rescueth the proscripts.</note>
For Pompeius had sent certain ships to keep upon the coast of Italy, and pinnaces everywhere,
to the end to receive all them that fled on that side; giving
them double recompence that saved a proscript, and honourable
offices to men that had been consuls and escaped, comforting
and entertaining the others with a most singular courtesy.
Many went into Macedon to Brutus and Cassius: others into
Africa to Cornificius. Some, having escaped the tempest that
was in the time of Sylla, were even glutted with this cruelty: as
amongst others, M. Fidustius, and Lucius Philuscius. T. Labienus
was one of the number of the murtherers in the proscription
of Sylla. <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">T. Labienus tormented with a guilty conscience.</note>
Afterwards he did nothing else but go up and
down with a soul possessed with furies: so that, being weary of
his life at this time, he went and sat in a chair at his gate,
quietly <term>attending</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">waiting</note> that they should put him in the number of
them that should be killed. Statius Samnis, an honourable
senator, being fourscore years old, because thieves should have
no part of his goods, he left them in prey to whosoever would
take them: and afterwards set his house on fire, and burnt
himself within it. Aponius, being kept a good while by his
slaves, was so weary to be shut up in a troublesome place, and
where he lived very poorly, that he came out to the marketplace,
and held out his throat to the murtherers. Cestius, being
possessed with the like grief, caused his slaves to make a great
fire, and then cast himself in it. Sulpitius Rufus, a man that
had been consul, died because of an <term>ile</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">isle</note> of his the which he
would not sell unto Fulvia: as also Ampius Balbus, for that
he refused to give this woman a pleasant place of his. Balbus
was betrayed by a servant of his, that shortly after was hanged
upon a gibbet by sentence of the people, and so had his reward
for his villanous <term>fact.</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">deed</note> Antonius did put in the number

out of his hands an <term>emerod</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">emerald</note> esteemed at fifty thousand crowns.
But Nonius found the means to escape with his emerod, to the
great despite of him that greedily desired this prey. Some valiantly
defended themselves, as Atteius Capito, that killed many
soldiers running rudely upon him, thinking he would have suffered
himself to be killed as others were. Howbeit after he had
sold his flesh dear, he was overcome by multitude of assailants.
Vetulinus, aided with his son, having many times valiantly 
<pb n="241"/>

repulsed the murtherers, he would have saved himself in Sicilia:
but in the <term>straight</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">strait.</note> he met with such a number of enemies, that
there he was killed. Sicilius Coranas, a senator, was put in the
number of proscripts, and because he would not with others
condemn Brutus and Cassius, devising how to escape, he put
himself in rank among those that carried a dead corpse to
burial: but he was discovered and put to death. The Triumviri
appointed such men as they <term>liked</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">approved</note> of, to take charge of them
that had been killed. They sold the goods of the proscripts by
the drum, at such a price as the soldiers would: and yet the
most part of them were spoiled and given away. 
<note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Promise broken with the widows and children of the slain men.</note>
They promised the widows their jointure, and to the sons the tenth part of the
patrimony of their fathers, and to the daughters the twentieth
part. Howbeit there were few, and in manner none, that had
any benefit by that: but to the contrary, they
<term>sacked</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">plundered.</note> many 
that demanded such rights. On the other side, they did exact great
sums of money upon the city of Rome, and over all Italy: the
owners were constrained to give the half of their yearly revenue:
the tenants to furnish one year's rent of that they held of others:
the masters of houses, the half of the rent of their houses, according
to the rent they went for. To encourage the soldiers,
the Triumviri gave <term>unmeasurable</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">immeasurable.</note>
gifts, granted them daily new pillage: the legions wintered in the richest towns, who were
compelled to feed the soldiers at their own charge. 
Furthermore,
all the rich men were constrained to pay, in nature of a
tribute, at one time, the tenth part of all that they were worth.
To be short, so that they could find out new inventions, it was
enough to exact money. For the fear, and custom to endure
all, had fashioned men to be more slaves, than the murtherers
and exactors would have had them. And to close up all, the
Triumviri caused money to be coined, the which on the one
side had the image of Antonius with an inscription in Latin, the
<term>effect</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">meaning</note>
whereof is this: M. Antonius Emperor, Augur, Triumvir,
for the establishment of the commonwealth. And on the other
side there were three hands joined together, with the marks 
of the consulship, and had these words: Salus generis humani,
that is to say: 'The <term>health</term>

there. After this victory, Antonius went into the east
to dispose of his affairs in Asia, and to levy money there to pay
his soldiers, having promised to every one of them five hundred
crowns. Caesar returned into Italy to refresh himself, to assign
colonies to his soldiers, to pacify the troubles Lepidus had <term>procured,</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">caused.</note>and to set a pike betwixt him and Pompey at a need, if
he were never so little in league with him. Caesar fell grievously
sick at Brundusium: but being recovered again, he entered
into Rome, pacified all things, and kept Lepidus in his
wonted degree. But when he came to bring his soldiers into
colonies, then the storm began to rise: for the owners cried out
that they were tyrannized, being driven out of their inheritances:
the old soldiers they complained that promise was not
kept with them. Fulvia and some others <term>practised</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">plotted.</note> to set them
on, to the end to draw a war into Italy, and by this means to
make Antonius come again, besotted by Cleopatra. These
things proceeded so far that Fulvia took arms; for she was then
in the camp, her sword by her side; and commanded like a captain.
<note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Augustus leaeth his army against the allies

Caesar on the other side, being angry, sent her daughter
home to her, unto whom he was betrothed, and led his army
against the Nursinians and Sentinates, the allies of Fulvia. In
the mean space Lucius Antonius departed in the night with
speed, and entered into Rome by treason: used it as a city
taken in war, and drave out Lepidus. Caesar left Salvidienus
to besiege the Sentinates, returned to Rome, and drave out
Lucius, followed him and shortened his journey as he was going
into Gaul, shut him up and besieged him a great time in
<term>Perouse,</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">Perusia</note> and compelled him through famine to yield himself,
and to crave pardon, which he granted him. Perouse was burnt
by a strange accident: for one of the chiefest of the city having
set his house on fire, after he had wounded himself with his
dagger, a boisterous wind being risen upon it so dispersed the
flames abroad, that it burnt all the houses besides. Caesar
caused some of his captains to be killed that were against him.
He condemned the Nursinians in a great sum of money, and
because they could not pay it, he drave them out of their city
and territory. Afterwards he suppressed some troubles raised
in Naples by Tiberius Claudius Nero, father of Tiberius Caesar,
and favourer of Fulvia: who seeing herself under foot, she fled
unto Athens. But Caesar, to prevent a new conspiracy, sent
Lucius Antonius far from Rome, to command the legions that
were in Spain: he gave him also commissioners to look into

him, and to observe his actions. He <term>finely</term>

On the other side, Fulvia being dead, Caesar and Antonius agreed, being ready to fight:
after that, they made peace with Pompey that governed Sicilia. 
Immediately after that, he went into Gaul, to appease some
troubles that happened there, and sent Agrippa before, who 
compelled the Aquitans to submit themselves, and pacified all 
Gaul. On the other side Cneus Calvinus subdued the Ceretanians  
in Spain. And because the legions had committed certain

sent for Antonius and Lepidus out of Greece and Africa, to
come to aid him. Antonius came to the haven of Brundusium:
but upon the sudden, not known wherefore, he took sea again,
and returned from whence he came.
<note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Augustus' lieutenant overcome by Sextus Pompeius.</note>
Lepidus came too late, which made Caesar (seeing all the weight fall on his arms) that he

near unto Tauromenion, and Caesar brought to that extremity
that he was ready to kill himself. But Cornificius ran to the
shore, who saved him, and brought him to the camp: from
whence he retired further off, and very quickly (but with great
danger) unto Messala.

better, insomuch as Lepidus was suspected to lean on that side,
Caesar resolved to commit all to the hazard of a latter battle:
and to draw Pompey unto it, he cut him so short of victuals,
that he was constrained to come to blows, and the fight was
very cruel: wherein Agrippa bestirred himself so valiantly, that
he wan 2 the victory, sunk twenty-eight ships, brake and spoiled
the most part of the rest, and took two of the chiefest captains
Pompey had: one of the which, called Demochares, killed himself
with his own hands.

                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">troops.</note> unto Lepidus: some Greek historians report that it
was to Caesar. Plemminius was within Messina with eight legions,
and did capitulate with Lepidus, to render up the town
to him. Whereupon Agrippa happened to come thither: who
maintained that they ought to regard Caesar that was absent
then. But that stood him in no stead: for Lepidus entered the
town, and gave the spoil of it as well to Plemminius' soldiers asto his. 
<note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Augustus unarmed entereth into Lepidus' camp, who being forsaken loseth all.</note>
Thereupon Caesar undertook a thing worthy of memory,
which was; that, being unarmed, he went into Lepidus' camp,
and turning by the blows of the darts that were thrown at him
by some, which hit his cloke and pierced it, he took hold of an
ensign of a legion. Then the soldiers, all of them armed, followed
him, and left Lepidus; who shortly after lost empire and
army: he that with twenty legions promised himself Sicilia and
a great deal more. Caesar gave him his life, and the office of
<pb n="245"/>

sovereign bishop of Rome, whither he sent him. Some say he
was banished. Upon these stirs there rose a sedition in Caesar's
camp through the insolency of the soldiers, that ran even to his
judgment-seat, using great menaces.

and sent some others to their houses, and gave unto them that

soldier: which is thought to amount near to fifty crowns. He
made them to be mustered, and found that they were five and
forty legions, five and twenty thousand horsemen, and six and
thirty thousand lightly armed. Afterwards he did great honours
unto his lieutenant Agrippa for his notable service, and commanded
Statilius Taurus to go into Africa to take possession of
the provinces of Lepidus.

into Mauritania, the sea being rough stayed him: which was the
cause that he sent his army into Illyria, and set upon the
Iapudes, which did him much mischief, yet at the last he overcame
them. <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Augustus hurt in his thighs, arms, and one of his knees.</note>
Then he ran upon the Pannonians and the Dalmatians,

Illyrians. On the other side, Messala, his lieutenant, fought
against the Salassians, dwelling in a valley environed with high
mountains of the Alps; and after divers overthrows, he made
them subject to the empire. And shortly after Caesar was
chosen consul the second time: but he resigned the office the

proceedings of Antonius in favour of Cleopatra hastened the
war, whereupon followed the battle of Actium, the flying of
these wicked lovers, and the beginning of the monarchy of
Caesar, confirmed by the conquest of Egypt, and the tragical
death of Antonius and Cleopatra. The which we touch briefly,
the whole being largely set down in the life of Antonius. They
did great honours unto Caesar after these exploits. The memory
of Antonius was condemned, and his statues maimed and thrown
down to the ground. A little before, M. Lepidus, son of the
Triumvir and of Junia sister of Brutus, conspired against Caesar.
<note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">M. Lepidus put to death for consipracy.</note>

After the utter overthrow of Antonius, Caesar <term>took order</term>

for the affairs of the east parts. He made alliance with Herodes king of Judea.
He sent the king of the Parthians son in hostage to Rome, until
they should send all the ensigns and standards they had won
of Crassus and Antonius. He governed the affairs of Asia, received
into league and friendship with him the kings of Galatia,
Cappadocia, and Paphlagonia: and he punished some others by
fines, that were not his friends. He gave privileges to the cities
of Ephesus, of Nice, Pergame, and Bithynia, to build temples
in the honour of Julius Caesar, of Rome, and of himself. He
set the Samians at liberty, and after he had taken order1 for all
the rest, he went towards Italy: where, after he was arrived, it
cannot be expressed with what great joy he was received of
high and low, from Brundusium unto Rome. <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Augustus triupmheth.</note>
There he triumphed three days together, for the Illyrians, for Antonius, and
for Cleopatra. He gave great presents unto soldiers, and besides
the money that was made of the booty, and distributed by

to a <term>centener,</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">centurion</note> and the treble to a knight: and to every person

brought such store of gold and silver out of Egypt (by him reduced
into a province, and condemned to pay twenty millions
of gold to the people of Rome for a fine) that he brought down
usury from twelve in the hundred, to four: and made that land
and houses were sold dear, where before the rich men had
them almost for nothing. Furthermore, he <term>brought-in</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">introduced</note>a marvellous
change in all traffic: he also abolished all taxes and
subsidies imposed by necessity of the civil wars. He cried
down all strange coin, which were at too high a price for their

law, and all through the iniquity of time. He lent out money 
for a time, without interest, unto those that had means to make
double profit of it. He would not receive the gold which the
cities of Italy sent him to make him crowns: but sent them it
back again with his thanks for their good will He gave the
pastime for all manner of games and magnificent sights unto
the people, such as they had never seen before. He made
goodly feasts unto the senators and magistrates, and by a world
of pleasures he appeased the sorrow of proscription, and of so
many civil wars. <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Good tidings brought to Augustus from Crassus his lieutenant.</note>
Being occupied in these matters, letters came
from Crassus, Caesar's lieutenant, advertising that he had subdued
the Bastarnes, divers people of Maesia, of Dacia, and of
Thracia: that he had won seven or eight battles of them, that
with his own hands he had killed the king of the Bastarnes,
and had brought the king of Getes to such extremity, that he
killed himself. <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">The temple of Ianus shut the third time</note>
These news did increase the joy, and the triumph

At this time Caesar, that was in his <term>fift</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">fifth</note> consulship, numbered
and mustered all the people of Rome, reformed the senate, the

to the poor. <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Augustus setteth the commonwealth in order.</note>
They that had been bound to the commonwealth of
too long a time, he discharged them and burnt their obligations.

the patricians, greatly diminished by the proscriptions and civil

the commonwealth in good strength, the laws honoured, justice
in authority, the senate in their ancient glory, and the people
restored by him to their rights of assembly to choose their
yearly magistrates, and to give out their commissions and
charges according to their old custom: he began to reason the
matter with himself, which of the twain was most profitable,
either to keep (for the good of the state, and under the title of
a prince) the empire which he had in his hands: or whether he
should render it up unto the people. He found himself grieved
for that Antonius had oftentimes accused him of tyranny and
unjust invasion: and on the other part also he apprehended the
fury of the people, and the factions of ambitious men, which,
like the billows of the sea, would <term>incontinently</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">straightway</note> toss in horrible
fashion this unconstant sea. Being thus perplexed, one day he
took aside Agrippa and C. Macenas, his two faithful friends'
very wise men and of great experience above all others; and
prayed them to tell him plainly, without flattery, what they
thought of it, being resolved to follow that which should be
most expedient for the good of the commonwealth. Agrippa
by an ample discourse did counsel him to render up to the
people his principality and <term>signiority</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">dominion.</note>.
<note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Maecenas dissuadeth Augustus from laying aside the rule

tempering both opinions, and made himself master in such sort
that the people felt it not, but rather confessed that they needed
such a physician to raise them up again from the incurable maladies
they were fallen into. He thanked both his friends, gave
his niece Marcella to be the wife of Agrippa, and did him new
honours; proceedeth to a new review of the citizens of Rome;
and is chosen Prince of the Senate by Agrippa, who was then
his companion in the consulship. Furthermore, assuring himself
that so much good and honours as had been communicated
to the small and great, would make them they would not much
<term>pass for</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">care for</note> their ancient dignities and liberty: and that the sweetness
of the ease and rest they did enjoy would make them forget
all the good and evil past; he borrowed of his magnanimity
the marvellous counsel that followeth. He resolved to discharge
himself of the principality into the hands of all the Senate, to
render it unto the people; hoping that the Senate, seeing his
affection so to submit himself to the accustomed order, and not
to seek a domination and government <term>ill-willed</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">against men's wills.</note>, they 
would thank him the more: that all the great persons would lay 
aside
<pb n="249"/>

the envy which they might bear unto him, and that the people
would esteem and love him so much the more. Upon this
thought, and after he had acquainted some of the senators
withal that stood affected to him, to the end to win others by
their means, he made an oration in open Senate, well studied,
and fit for the time. Having made a long discourse of the great
extent of the empire, and of his insufficiency, he added unto it,
that this common burthen could not be carried but by the immortal
gods: that he had continued some years to manage a
part of it, and that experience had made him know that his
shoulders were too weak to bear such a burthen as the principality,
subject to infinite changes, and exposed to a thousand
ambushes. <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Agustus requireth assistants to rule the empire.</note>
He therefore <term>required</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">asked</note>, the city being furnished
with so many noble persons, that the affairs might be managed
by many men, who joining themselves together, might more
easily satisfy the charges than one alone: that in a good hour,
having set all things in good estate again, he did put the commonwealth
into the hands of the Senate and people of Rome.
This oration diversely moved the senators. Some of them
thought, there was more art than truth in it. Others judged,
that it was not expedient to put the estate into the power of
many. The most of them, enriched and made great by Caesar,
and that were risen up by the ruins of their country, said: that
they should prefer that which now they had in hand, before all
the time past, beaten with so many tempests. Many others <term>enclined</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">inclined</note>to that side, not that they were in good earnest of that
mind, but for fear to be looked upon with an evil eye, if they
did speak against their companions. 
<note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">The Senate and the people not willing to take the government into their hands.</note>
So then all of them with one consent, unadvisedly, rather than of a common and ripe
judgment, began to beseech and adjure Caesar, that it would
please him to be chief and preserver of the empire, of the which
he had set down so many goodly and happy foundations. Immediately
they ordained that Caesar's guard should have twice
as much pay as they had before. Agrippa was of opinion, that
they should <term>cassiere</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">cashier</note> the Spanish guard, and Caesar in their

                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">Germans</note>, knowing well that in
those great bodies there was little malice hidden, and less subtilty:
and that they were a people that took more pleasure to be

and in the which he should be driven to make war. In those
that were quiet, he established proconsuls: and for others' he
governed them by his lieutenants, which had their lesson, according

And because he would beautify and adorn Rome, as the majesty of the

He wisely reformed the ancient laws, and made new that were very necessary. To make sure work in

senators that had been consuls, and did privately acquaint
them with all that was requisite to be done for the preservation
of the quietness of the commonwealth, giving order that nothing

The year before, he had reduced the number of senators to six
hundred, ail honourable men. At that time also he re-established
the ancient order and dignity: ordaining that the Senate
should have the superintendency of the treasure, and of all the
revenues that belonged to the people of Rome: that all the
expenses for the commonwealth should be made by their ordinance:
that the senators should have the hearing of all crimes
of treason, conspiracy, ambushes, and offences to his Majesty's
person: and that it should pertain to them to give entertainment
and answer that should be fit, to ambassadors of nations.
When in matters of importance he asked the advice of the
Senate, instead of coming to the Prince of the Senate according
to the accustomed manner, or to him that was appointed Consul,
or to other senators by order: he made choice of any one
of them which he thought good, to the end that every one
should give attentive ear, and be ready to deliver his opinion:
<pb n="252"/>


and not to hold his head down in his rank, and content himself
to be of other men's minds. He ordained also, that the whole
body of the Senate should not assemble but from fifteen days
to fifteen days: howbeit that in ordinary matters the magistrates
should think of that that were expedient. In the months of September
and October, the senators were not bound to meet, but
only four hundred drawn by lot: who might establish any decree.
And as for himself, to honour this company the more, the
day of the assembly he never saluted any of the senators apart,
but all of them together in the council-chamber when they were
set, and all of them name by name, the one after the other. If
he would go out, and that he said he would detain the company
no longer, he bade them farewell in the same manner that he
had saluted them at his coming in.

understanding that England was full of sedition, Spain next
unto the mountains Pirenei in arms, and Gaul ready to rise:
he opened the temple of Janus, and took his journey to give
order for all. But the ambassadors of England <term>prevented</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">anticipated</note>him, and promised tribute. Then he went to Gaul in Narbonne,
to draw nearer to Spain. And so holding on his journey to
Narbonne, he pacified the Gauls, he made an exact numbering
of all the Gauls, of their goods, possessions, and slaves, and
caused the rolls to be brought unto him.
<note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Augustus maketh peace in France, and divideth it into four parts.</note>
He established laws and customs in every place, and divided Gaul into four parts:
of the which the first part was called Narbonense, which extendeth
itself from the river of Var unto the mountains Pirenei.
Aquitain the second, unto the river of Garonne. The third,
<pb n="253"/>
Gaul Lyonnoise, unto the river of Seine. Then Gaul Belgica,
bordered with the river of <term>Rhein</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">Rhine</note>:
and rated all the Gauls at ten millions of gold for a tax. Now there remained no more
for him to do, but to bring Spain to order: in the which the
Romans had made continual wars the space of 200 years together.
Nevertheless the Cantabrians and Asturians (which
are the Basques) and other people neighbours dwelling in the
mountains, they neither cared for Augustus, nor for the empire:
for they were ever in arms, and made incursions upon the allies
of the people of Rome, and did them great mischief, who complaining
unto Augustus of the great necessity they were brought
unto, he, being near unto them, came to aid them: and found
the Cantabrians besieging of a fort, having taken the town by
it called Sagesame. He charged them home with such fury
that he left them dead in the place, after they had valiantly defended
themselves. <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Augustus maketh war with the
Cantabrians and bringeth them to extreme famine and misery.</note>
Afterwards he divided his army into three
parts, and environed the country of the Cantabrians, who made
head for the space of five years, and did marvellous great hurt
to the Romans: and if the <term>streights</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">straits, passes.</note>,
whereby they might easily enter into their country, had not been discovered unto Augustus,
they had sent him home again to Rome with shame. But
having found the way to surprise them on every side, he made
a cruel war upon them, putting all to fire and blood. They retired
with speed to one of their highest mountains, with all that they
could carry with them. The Romans, perceiving that it was
too hard a match for them, if they should go thither to set upon
so warlike a nation, and that could not be subdued by force;
they made forts in the midst of the mountain, and placed a
strong guard there, to the end to famish the Cantabrians, and
by that means to bring them to reason. But they on the other
side, instead of yielding themselves, did <term>abide</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">endure</note> all the miseries
that any man can possibly think of: and it came to that pass,
that even to sustain nature the strong sons killed their own fathers,
the mothers their infants, and the young men did devour
the old, eating up their flesh. Upon this evil there followed
another, to wit, discord among them. Some would yield, others
were of another mind. The former alleging, that they must
needs submit themselves to the mercy of the Romans: the
other, that they should make a desperate sally upon the enemies'
camp, and so sell their lives. Their contention waxed so hot
and violent, that the Cantabrians thrust out ten thousand of the
Asturians with their wives and children, and compelled them to
<pb n="254"/>


descend along the forts made by the Romans: whom they intreated
with the tears in their eyes to make them slaves, and
to give them somewhat to eat. Tiberius then, one of Caesar's
lieutenants, would not suffer them to be received, to the end to
famish the one by the other, and to end this war without any
bloodshed. This poor people, being deprived of sustenance and
hope, and being afraid they should yet endure greater evils, began
to <term>powne</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">pound</note> a venomous herb like unto <term>smallage</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">wild cerley</note>, and poisoned
themselves. The young men killed themselves, running
one against another with their swords in their hands. The
others, to the number of three and twenty thousand, came down
in a most miserable <term>estate</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">state.</note> from the top of the mountain, and
yielded themselves to the discretion of the Romans; who set
aside ten thousand of the strongest of them, to serve them in
the war which they intended to make against the Asturians.
The rest were sold by <term>troups</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">troops</note>, with condition that they should
be carried far from their country, and that they should not be
made free, before they had served them as slaves the space of
thirty years. They disarmed ten thousand of them: which they
bare so <term>patiently</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">with such small patience.</note>,
that many killed themselves with their own
hands, esteeming their life nothing without arms. They say
that a little child with a dagger killed his father and brethren
that were chained together, and that by the commandment of
the father: and that a woman did the like to some of her kinsfolks.
And that many of these <term>mountainers</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">mountaineers</note>
accustomed to rob passengers, being upon the gibbet, sang out songs aloud, even
at their death, strewing a joy and marvellous courage. Augustus,
being then in those parts, gave leave to the soldiers of his
guard of Spaniards to depart into the territory of the Gascons
with great presents, and privilege to enter in rank amongst the
Roman legions. He built <term>Saragousse</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">Saragossa.</note>,
and other towns, which he replenished with soldiers, to bridle the courses and tumults

<note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Augustus warring against the Asturians, driveth them to extremities.</note>
Then having overthrown the Conisces, friends of the Asturians, taken their head city, and put
all the inhabitants thereof to the sword: he set upon the Asturians,
who, being environed of all parts, and choosing rather to
die than to be made slaves, burnt, killed, and poisoned themselves,
and with them many other of their neighbours. There
were some of them yet left alive, with whom the Cantabrians
joined and other their neighbours, and that a long time. <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">All goods common amongst

and used him as himself: and so also in adversity they ran one
<term>fortune</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">took the same risk</note>,
or else killed themselves immediately after their friends
were dead. Among them were certain loose people gathered
together out of divers parts, who resolved all together to go
charge the Romans, and came to fight with such a fury, that
nothing but the night could separate them, having lost many of
both sides. The next morning they began to <term>join</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">join battle</note>
again with more violence than before, and the fight continued even till
night, that the Romans obtained the victory: but they confessed,
that they never encountered with such cruel enemies. They
that were left alive fled into a town, in the defence whereof they
made themselves all to be killed, rather than to yield themselves.
Augustus built certain places there in that country,
which afterwards by time were much enlarged. In this selfsame
year of his ninth consulship, Terentius Varro, his lieutenant,
subdued the Salassians, which are those of the vale of
Ostre: he disarmed them, sold the young men by the <term>drum</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">by auction</note>,
gave part of the territory unto the soldiers Praetorians, and
built there a city called Augusta Praetoria. Vinicius also appeased
some troubles in Germany, and made war very fortunately
in divers places. By means of which victories, Augustus
was called the <term>eight</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">eighth</note> time Imperator, as much to say as sovereign
captain: and they suffered him to wear from that time
forth, the first day of the year, a hat of laurel and a robe of triumph.
At his return he shut the temple of Janus the fourth
time, married Cleopatra (the daughter of Antonius and Cleopatra) 
unto Juba the story-writer, overthrown by Julius Caesar
in Africa, with a part of Mauritania and of Getulia, to reign
there. He reduced into a province Gallogrecia and Lycaonia,
which made a portion of a kingdom: and, by reason of his sickness,
not able to be present at the marriage of his daughter
Julia, whom Marcellus married, the son of Octavia his sister,
he left all to the charge of Agrippa, and went to Rome. There
being chosen Consul the tenth time, the Senate gave him absolute
power over the estate and laws, to make and undo them at
his pleasure. They did him greater honours than before, and
gave Marcellus his nephew, before his time, great offices in the
commonwealth: and to Tiberius his wife's son.
<note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Augustus liberality towards the people.</note>
He in token of thankfulness gave to everyone of the people ten crowns
apiece. Whilst these matters were in hand, the Cantabrians
and their neighbours revolted, by subtilty caught some of the
<pb n="256"/>


Romans, and cut their throats. Aelius Lamia, governor in
those parts, to be revenged of this outrage, put all the whole
country to fire and blood, destroyed some towns, and sold their
young men by the drum. To be short, he followed them so
hard, that he brought them in subjection. Aelius Gallus, governor
of Egypt, almost about the same time, being sent by
Augustus' commandment with ten thousand men, five hundred
soldiers of Herod's guard, and fifteen hundred Nabateians under
the conduct of a noble man of Arabia called Sylleus, he did
nothing to be accounted of, but discover the country. But
having lost the most part of his men within the deserts where
this Sylleus brought them, and overcome the Sabeans in a battle,
he was enforced to retire. Afterwards this Sylleus, for that
he killed his king Oboda by treason, he was taken prisoner, and
beheaded by the decree of the Senate.

                  <milestone n="12" ed="Skeat" unit="chapter"/> Augustus being consul for the eleventh time, the plague
was in Rome; and, for himself, he was grievously sick but
restored again to health by Antonius Musa his physician; the
people therefore caused a statue to be set up to this Antonius,
the Senate did him great honours, and, in favour of his profession,
gave immunity to all others that from that time forth
did practice physic. 
<note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">The people of Rome are gald gfor Augustus' health.</note>
Furthermore, by many ceremonies they did
shew the joy they had for the health of Augustus: and specially
fathers of household, dying, expressly commanded their children
to bring their sacrifices to the Capitol with a title in great letters,
saying: THAT AT THE DAY OF THEIR DEATH THEY LEFT
AUGUSTUS IN GOOD HEALTH. It was also ordained that from
that time forth they should never put any man to death, as often
as Augustus entered into the city. Shortly after he did associate
with himself Calpurnius Piso in the consulship, who had followed
the party of Pompey and of Brutus. Afterwards, when he was
gone from Rome into the country, he made Lucius Cestius his
deputy for him, an <term>inward</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">secret</note> friend of Brutus and of his memory.
Whereat the Senate marvelling, by decree made him perpetual
proconsul of the Roman empire, tribune of the people, and gave
him power to assemble the Senate as often and when it pleased
him. The people would have compelled him to have been
dictator: but he bowing a knee, casting down his long robe,
and strewing his breast, besought them to discharge him of so
odious an <term>estate</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">dignity</note>. In the meantime he accepted the decree of
the Senate, and the charge to cause corn to be brought in,
because of the dearth that chanced in Rome. In the which he
<pb n="257"/>

served his turn by Tiberius, created quaestor at the age of nineteen
years. As for Marcellus his nephew, he was chosen Aedilis Curulis,
who aided him to set forth all the magnificent pomp of plays,
which he caused to be played before the people.
<note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Marcellus Augustus' nephew dieth, to the great grief of all men.</note>
Every man judged that he should be the successor of all his power: but
this young man of great hope died shortly after, to the great
grief of every man: and no man can tell whether it was of
natural sickness, or of poison given him by the practices of
Livia. A little before his death, Agrippa, impatient to bear the
rising of this Marcellus whom he despised, went into Asia under
<term>colour</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">pretence</note> of another voyage. They say that Augustus, much
troubled with sickness, returned to his first consultation, to put
the commonwealth again into the hands of the Senate and
people; and for this cause he called for the senators and all the
other magistrates, unto whom he gave an account of the empire;
and that was a little book containing the numbering 
of all the riches, towns, and provinces, allies, legions, armies by sea and
by land, of all the kingdoms and countries tributary, of all the
customs of the empire of Rome, that which was necessary to 
be <term>leavied</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">levied.</note> or released. But being somewhat amended again, he
changed his mind. And furthermore, having given audience to
the ambassadors of Phrahartes king of the Parthians, which
demanded a son of his brought by Tyridates unto Augustus, he
sent back the child, and suffered Tyridates to remain at 
Rome, where he sumptuously entertained him. By this 
means he kept himself in friendship with the one and the other, and held 
the Parthians in suspense, to the end they should alter 
nothing. At the beginning of the next year following, under the consulship
of M. Claudius Marcellus and of L. Arruntius, the famine increasing
at Rome, he wisely provided for it. And then the
people would constrain him by force to accept the dictatorship,
and threatened to set the palace on fire and to burn 
all the senators in it, if they refused to allow this decree. He would
none of the office of dictatorship, and did refuse also to be
censor, although that office had been void the space of 28 years.
<note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Augustus reformeth many disorders in apparel,

At the same time Fannius Caepio and L. Muraena, having conspired against him, and being

<pb n="258"/>

discovered by Castricius, were taken as they thought to have
escaped, and put to death. In the meantime the Asturians and
Cantabrians, ill <term>intreated</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">badly treathed.</note>
by Carisius, they rebelled, but were overcome in a set battle, and the prisoners sold. The Cantabrians,

The Asturians, being overcome the fourth time, did submit themselves, and their arms were
taken from them. In the same time, Petronius, governor of
Egypt, followed with IO,OOO footmen, and with 800 horse, went
to make war with the Ethiopians, which dwell under Egypt,
who had invaded and ruined certain towns, overthrown and
carried away the statues of Augustus. Thereupon he pursued
them, and made them fly before him: took certain places upon
them, and pierced far into their country: so that he <term>inforced</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">forced</note> their queen to send her ambassadors unto Augustus (then

                  <milestone n="13" ed="Skeat" unit="chapter"/> At the beginning of the spring he prepared himself to
give order for the affairs in the east; but because they that bent
themselves for the consulship had almost put the city in alarm,
and that in the end, notwithstanding the order he had set down,
the people had chosen men whom Augustus feared: through
the advice of Maecenas, be made Agrippa come again to govern
Rome in his absence, and married unto him his daughter Julia,
Marcellus' widow. 
<note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Augustus saileth into Greece, and into Asia, and what he did there.</note>
Now whilst Agrippa gave order for the affairs

Athenians, from whom he took away the tribute they had <term>leavied</term>

made little account of strangers' ceremonies, yet he made himself
to be received into the fraternity of mysteries; and the ambassadors
of Persia having caused the temple of Jupiter Olympian
to be finished, begun of long time in Athens, they ordained that
it should be dedicated to the spirit of Augustus. Being passed
from thence into Asia, he gave order to his provinces and those
of the people of Rome; punished the Cyzicenians that had killed
the Roman citizens in their town. He imposed a tribute upon
those of Tyre and Sidon, who had dealt badly, and brought
them into the form of a province. He did much good unto the
towns that had been faithful unto the commonwealth: to some
of them he gave the right of burgesship of Rome, and to others
<pb n="259"/>

the same rights and privileges which the natural 
citizens of Rome had. He built up again the cities of Laodicea, 
and of Thyatira: he set them up of the <term>ile</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">isle</note> of Chio again, 
afflicted before by an earthquake; he did exempt them from all 
subsidies for six years. He restored certain realms unto their 
kings whom he had subdued: or else he did establish others anew, who came
to attend him at his court as subjects, without any signs or
tokens of royal dignity. He sent Tiberius into Armenia, to
instal Tigranes unto his royal throne again, having beer. driven
out of it. Tiberius returned thither, and having fought with the
Armenians, he gave them Artavasdes to their king, who ruled
not long. Phraates, king of the Parthians, being afraid they
would set upon him, was very careful to get all the Romans
together, which were taken after the overthrow of Crassus and
Antonius; whom he sent, every man of them, unto Augustus,
with all the standards and ensigns, and also his son and nephews
for pledges of his faithful friendship unto the people of Rome.
Augustus granted him peace, and then he came into the ile1 of
Samos, comforted Rhodes replenished Corinth and Patras with
a great number of men enfranchised, whom he made burgesses
of Rome. In this place also there came unto him ambassadors
from Porus and Pandion, two of the mightiest kings of the
Indians, who prayed alliance and friendship with him, and
brought him very rare presents. There came with them a
philosopher of India called Zannanus: who being brought to
the city of Athens, burnt himself alive, as one Calamus did in
the time of Alexander the Great.

who made infinite numbers of honours unto Augustus at his
return: howbeit he would not accept them all, but carried himself
very modestly in every place where he was. The people
chose him censor for five years, and perpetual consul: and at
his request they granted triumph unto Cornelius Balbus, although

marched directly against the enemies: who had the better at

being rebuked and punished by Agrippa, who gave them barley
for wheat, he returned again to fight. But then the Cantabrians
that bare arms were all cut in pieces, the rest disarmed, and
drawn from the mountain to dwell in the plain. Augustus was
saluted emperor or sovereign captain, because of this victory:
but Agrippa modestly refused triumph, and within a while after
he overcame the Pannonians also. The year following, the

adding also, " that those that sought a little gain with great loss

put the knight into the hands of one of his bondmen enfranchised,
and was contented to drive him out of Rome. Furthermore
he procured that the Senate should not be kept but with
great reverence: that the senators should come together as into
a temple of devotion, and that no decree should pass, but in the

he took very great care that there should no <term>insolencies</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">wanton acts.</note>
be committed. He punished the players in divers sorts that behaved
themselves more licentiously than became them. And
when one of them amongst them called him lord, he shewed the
people with his voice, his eyes, and his hand, that he was not
well pleased withal: and the next morning he published a sharp
edict, forbidding all persons expressly to say so, and would never
suffer that any of his should give him this name. But these
plays being ended, he adopted Caius and Lucius the sons of
Agrippa. In all this great business, the Sicambres, Usipetes,
and Tenchteres, people of Germany, surprised certain Romans

well enough. For after he had gotten an infinite mass of gold and
silver together, he brought it to Augustus, saying, he had never
other intention but to take from the Gauls the means to rebel.
For all this Augustus withdrew him from thence, and sent Tiberius
thither to settle all things in good estate again. Almost during
these commotions and outrageous dissensions, the Rhetians,
near unto the lake of Como, brake into Gaul Cisalpine, and
took out of Italy store of booty. They were a people separated
from all others, and so cruel, that, having taken any place from
the Romans, they killed all the male children, and further, did

themselves so cruel in this fight, that, their darts failing them,
they took their little children by their legs, and did most barbarously
force themselves to smite their enemies in the face.
Those that were driven out of Italy would have entered into
Gaul, but they were repulsed by Tiberius. In the end, these
people and their allies were constrained to submit themselves.

Augustus having pacified Gaul, stayed the invasions of

Drusus with authority and his army upon the Rhine. and came
to Rome as Agrippa did out of Asia, and became extremely
sick of the gout. Lepidus died at the same time, to whom
Augustus succeeded in the estate of chief bishop, and made
sumptuous spectacles and sights unto the people. He burnt all
the books of divination and prophecy, except those of the
Sibyls: and yet he kept them not all. He reformed the calendar,
and ordained that there should be no leap-years for twelve
years following. He suffered that the <term>sixt</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">sixth</note>
month, then called Sextilis, should be called Augustus after his name. All that
year was spent in plays and pastimes, saving that Augustus
(having been sick) caused all that he had done in his government
to be rehearsed before the Senate. He took a review of
the senators, and confirmed his nephew Agrippa in the estate of
a tribune for five years more.

But shortly after, this great person, being returned from a journey out of Pannonia, whither he was

a marvellous grief unto him: and not knowing now on whom he

not long in good terms together. From thenceforth Tiberius and
Drusus dealt almost in all the affairs of war, and Tiberius especially

that gave up their offices. But Augustus compelled those that
were of age, of quality and sufficiency, and gave order also that
the dignity of the tribunes of the people should remain entire:
suffering those notwithstanding which had this office, their time
expired, to be amongst the senators, or with knights. As for
the towns of Asia afflicted with the earthquake, he paid of his

In the meantime Drusus passed over the Rhine,

and especially in a great battle, where were killed a

troops in the field where the battle was pitched. Afterwards he
built above fifty castles upon the rivers of Meuse, Visurge, and
of the Rhine. Tiberius on the other side was in Dalmatia

this for the twelfth time. But in these businesses, the war
was hot in Thracia, and more than ever before: all the provinces
being in rebellion under the conduct of Bulogaeses, who
had killed the king Rhacuspolis, an ally of the people of Rome,
driven out his uncle and lieutenant Rhymetalces out of Thracia
into Chersonesus. L. Piso, governor of Pamphilia, went against
them, and at the first encounter had not the advantage, but in
the second he overcame them utterly. Drusus, having made a
voyage to Rome, to celebrate the birthday of Augustus in great
magnificence, whilst his troops reposed themselves in their garrisons;
about the spring he returned into Germany, overcame
the Suabians, gave them a king then he invaded the country
of the Marcomannes, fought with them divers times, killed a
great number of them, and made all the rest subject to the
Romans. Because of this victory, and of that of Piso, Augustus
was called imperator the thirteenth time. <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Proculus

whereof the people complained: but in the end he subdued
them, and built many castles upon the river of Danuby to stay
the invasions of the enemies. Piso also in Thracia overcame
the Maesians, and Bastarnes, and brought away a great number
of prisoners, who bit their iron chains for anger, and most impatiently
did bear their servitude. Drusus made the Cattians
subject also, then he came to Lyons to meet with Augustus:
from whence they both returned together into Italy. They had
a custom also that yearly on the first day of January (though
Augustus were absent) all the senators, officers of justice, and
others of mean estate, brought him new-year's gifts to the
Capitol: and also every one cast a piece of gold or silver into
the lake Curtius, for a vow that they had made to his health.
He did bestow all these new-year's gifts to buy many rich
statues of the gods, which he set up in all the cross-streets.

told him: "I understood nothing" another, "I would speak

persuaded himself he should tame them well enough, using the

did at Rome. So he had a judgment-seat, and all matters were
pleaded before him. Some of them amongst the rest, being
very subtle, seemed to esteem much this pleading; and to bring

messages unto Tiberius, fame spreading it abroad that Augustus
was dead, and that Tiberius held his place. Augustus, being at
the point to give up the ghost, made himself to be combed, and
speaking to his friends, asked if nobody made any noise without.
So he exhorted them to rejoice with him, for that he had
so happily played the comedy of this human life. Then having
sent them all out of his chamber, he asked if Livia, Drusus'
daughter, were in health: and so, embracing his wife, said these
words unto her: " Farewell, Livia, behave thyself weld, and remember

where he was reduced into ashes, which they closed up in his
sepulchre, built in his sixth consulship; after all these ceremonies
the Senate appointed him a temple and divine honours,
and he was placed in rank with the gods. To make his honour

Aethra was the daughter of Pitheus, and Alcmena (the mother

So he thought he should be utterly shamed and disgraced,

Whereof he was so glad, and chiefly for that he had won his club, that ever

And like as this spoil of the lion did witness the greatness of the beast

never cut them down, nor burn them. But Theseus funding
her, called her, and sware by his faith he would use her gently,
and do her no hurt, nor displeasure at all. Upon which promise
she came out of the bush, and bare unto him a goodly boy,

Minos' ambassadors out of Creta, to ask a tribute, being now
the third time that it was demanded; which the Athenians
paid for this cause. Androgeus, the eldest son of king Minos,
was slain by treason within the country of Attica: for which
cause Minos, pursuing the revenge of his death, made very hot
and sharp wars upon the Athenians, and did them great hurt.
But besides all this, the gods did sharply punish and scourge
all the country, as well with barrenness and famine as also with
plague and other mischiefs, even to the drying up of their rivers.
The Athenians perceiving these sore troubles and plagues, ran
to the oracle of Apollo, who answered them that they should
appease Minos, and when they had made their peace with him,
that then the wrath of the gods would cease against them, and
their troubles should have an end. <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">The manner of the tribute conditioned.</note>Whereupon the Athenians

him to turn and stay from his purpose, and perceiving in the
end there was no remedy but he would go, he then drew lots
for the children which should go with him. Hellanicus notwithstanding
doth write, that they were not those of the city
which drew lots for the children they should send, but that
Minos himself went thither in person, and did choose them, as
he chose Theseus the first, upon condition agreed between
them: that is to wit, that the Athenians should furnish them
with a ship, and that the children should ship and embark with
him, carrying no weapons of war: and that after the death of
the Minotaur this tribute should cease. <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">The Athenians sent their children into Creta in a ship with a black sail.  Aegeus giveth the master of the ship a white sail to signify the safe return of Theseus.</note>Now before that time,
there was never any hope of return, nor of safety of their children;
therefore the Athenians always sent a ship to convey their
children, with a black sail, in token of assured loss. Nevertheless
Theseus putting his father in good hope of him, being of a
good courage, and promising boldly that he would set upon this
Minotaur, Aegeus gave unto the master of the ship a white sail,
commanding him that at his return he should put out the white
sail if his son had escaped: if not, that then he should set up
the black sail, to shew him afar off his unlucky and unfortunate
chance. Simonides notwithstanding cloth say, that this sail
which Aegeus gave to the master, was not white, but red, dyed
in grain, and of the colour of scarlet, and that he gave it him to
signify afar off their delivery and safety. This master was
called Phereclus Amarsiadas, as Simonides saith. But Philochorus
writeth, that Scirus the Salaminian gave to Theseus a
master called Nausitheus, and another mariner to tackle the
sails, who was called Phaeas: because the Athenians at that
time were not greatly practiced to the sea. And this did Scirus,
for that one of the children on whom the lot fell was his nephew:
and thus much the chapels do testify, which Theseus built afterwards
in honour of Nausitheus and of Phaeas, in the village of
Phalerus, joining to the temple of Scirus. <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Cybernesia games.</note>And it is said moreover,

from village to village, and from family to family, to let them
understand the reasons why they should consent unto it. So he
found the poor people and private men ready to obey and follow
his will, but the rich, and such as had authority in every village,
all against it. Nevertheless he wan them, promising that it
should be a commonwealth, and not subject to the power of any
sole prince, but rather a popular state. In which he would only
reserve to himself the charge of the wars, and the preservation
of the laws: for the rest, he was content that every citizen, in all
and for all; should bear a like sway and authority. So there
were some that willingly granted thereto. <term>Other</term>

and some other hold opinion, that he went thither with
Hercules against the Amazons: and that to honour his valiantness,
Hercules gave him Antiopa the Amazon. But the more
part of the other historiographers, namely, Hellanicus, Pherecides,
and Herodotus, do write, that Theseus went thither alone,
after Hercules' voyage, and that he took this Amazon prisoner;
which is likeliest to be true. For we do not find that any other
who went this Journey with him, had taken any Amazon prisoner
besides himself. Bion also the historiographer, this notwithstanding, 
saith, that he brought her away by deceit and stealth.
<note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Antiopa the Amazon carried off by Theseus.</note>For the Amazons (saith he) naturally loving men, did not fly at

Menecrates, who wrote the history of the city of Nicea
in the country of Bithynia, saith: that Theseus having this Amazon
Antiopa with him, remained a certain time upon those
coasts, and that amongst other he had in his company three

which me thinks was not a matter of small moment, nor
an enterprise of a woman. For they had not placed their camp
within the very city of Athens, nor had not fought in the very
place itself (called Pnyce) adjoining to the temple of the Muses,
if they had not first conquered or subdued all the country thereabouts:
neither had they all come at the first, so valiantly to
assail the city of Athens. <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Bosphorus Cimmericus, an arm of the sea.</note>Now, whether they came by land
from so far a country, or that they passed over an arm of the
sea, which is called Bosphorus Cimmericus, being frozen as
Hellanicus saith: it is hardly to be credited. But that they'
camped within the precinct of the very city itself, the names of
the places which continue yet to this present day do witness it,
and the graves also of the women which died there. But so it
is, that both armies lay a great time one in the face of the other,
ere they came to battle. <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Theseus fighteth a battle with the Amazons.</note>Howbeit at the length Theseus, having
first made sacrifice unto Fear the goddess, according to the'
counsel of a prophecy he had received, he gave them battle in
the month of August, on the same day in the which the Athenians
do even at this present solemnise the feast which they
call Boedromia. <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">The order of the Amazons' battle.</note>But Clidemus the historiographer, desirous
particularly to write all the circumstances of this encounter,;
saith, that the left point of their battle bent towards the place
which they call Amazonion: and that the right point marched
by the side of Chrysa, even to the place which is called Pnyce,
upon which the Athenians, coming towards the temple of the
Muses, did first give their charge. And for proof that this is
true, the graves of the women which died in the first encounter,
are found yet in the great street which goeth towards the gate
<name>Piraica</name>, near unto the chapel of the little god Chalcodus. And
the Athenians (saith he) were in this place repulsed by the
Amazons, even to the place where the images of Eumenides are,
that is to say, of the furies. But on the other side also, the 
Athenians, coming towards the quarters of Palladium, Ardettus, 
and Lucium, <term>drave</term>

end of four months, peace was taken between them by means
of one of the women called Hippolyta. For this historiographer
calleth the Amazon which Theseus married, Hippolyta, and not
Antiopa. Nevertheless, some say that she was slain (fighting
on Theseus' side) with a dart, by another called Molpadia. In
memory whereof, the pillar which is joined to the temple of the
Olympian ground was set up in her honour. We are not to
marvel, if the history of things so ancient be found so diversely
written....

many goodly and notable exploits in the wars, yet Herodotus is
of opinion, that Theseus was never in any one of them, saying
that he was at the battle of the Lapithae against the Centauri.
Others say, to the contrary, that he was at the Journey of <term>Cholchide</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">Cholcis.</note>

came, 'Not without Theseus;' meaning that such a thing was
not done without great help of another.  <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Proverb. Not without Theseus.</note>Howbeit, it is certain
that Theseus self did many famous acts without aid of any man
and that, for his valiantness, this proverb came in use, which is
spoken 'This is another Theseus.' Also he did help Adrastus,
king of the Argives, to recover the bodies of those that were
slain in the battle before the city of Thebes. Howbeit, it was

And thus the greatest number of the most ancient writers do

of the year, the autumn or latter season is the fairest: that commonly

though in few other: for he was passing fair even to his

which is not to be wondered at, seeing his marvellous great
prosperity, as also adversity that followed him afterwards. But
of all the great desires he had, and that by nature he was most
inclined to, was ambition, seeking to have the upper hand in
all things, and to be taken for the best person: as appeareth
by certain of his deeds, and notable sayings in his youth, extant
in writing. One day wrestling with a companion of his, that
handled him hardly, and thereby was likely to have given him
the fall, he got his fellow's arm in his mouth, and bit so hard,
as he would have eaten it off. The other feeling him bite so
hard, let go his hold straight, and said unto him: " What, Alcibiades?
bitest thou like a woman?" "No, mary, do I not'"
quoth he, "but like a lion." Another time, being but a little
boy, he played at <term>skails</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">ninepins.</note> in the midst of the street with other
of his companions, and when his turn came about to throw,
there came a cart laden by chance that way: Alcibiades prayed
the carter to stay awhile, until he had played out his game, because
the skails were set right in the highway where the cart
should pass over. The carter was a stubborn knave, and would
not stay for any request the boy could make, but crave his
horse on still, insomuch as other boys gave back to let him go
on: but Alcibiades fell flat to the ground before the cart, and
bad the carter drive over, <term>and</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">if.</note> he durst. The carter, being
afraid, plucked back his horse to stay them: the neighbours,
frighted to see the danger, ran to the boy in all haste, crying
out. <note resp="trans" place="marg" anchored="yes">Alcibiades' studies.</note>Afterwards, when he was put to school to learn, he was very obedient to all his masters that taught him anything, saving

mouth so hard to it, that it taketh not only his words from him,

Thebans play on the flute, that cannot tell how to speak: as
for the Athenians, we have (as our forefathers tell us) for protectors
and patrons of our country, the goddess Pallas and the
god Apollo: of the which the one in old time (as it is said)

himself <term>leave</term>

had reason to despise playing on the flute, and that he mocked
all those that learned to play on it." So afterwards, it fell out
at Athens, that teaching to play on the flute was put out of the
number of honest and liberal exercises, and the flute itself was
thought a vile instrument and of no reputation.......

whom they had long before delayed: and so they sent Gylippus
their captain to overthrow the Athenians' army, which they had

counterfeit them when he would, as well the good as the bad.
For in Sparta, he was very <term>painful</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">laborious</note>, and in continual exercise:

he lived sparingly with little, end led a <term>straight</term>
                  <note resp="ed" anchored="yes" place="unspecified">strait, strict.</note> life. In Ionia,
to the contrary, there he lived daintily and superfluously, and
gave himself to all mirth and pleasure. In Thracia, he drank
ever, or was always on horseback. If he came to Tisaphernes,
lieutenant of the mighty king of Persia, he far exceeded the
magnificence of Persia in pomp and sumptuousness. And these
things notwithstanding, never altered his natural condition from
one fashion to another, neither did his manners (to say truly) receive
all sorts of changes. But because peradventure, if he had
shewed his natural disposition, he might, in divers places where
he came, have offended those whose company he kept, he did

whom he companied with, by transforming himself into
their natural countenance, as he that had seen him when he
was at Sparta, to have looked upon the outward man, would
have said as the common proverb saith:

nor who had the chief government of Athens, the nobility
or the commonalty, and did but seek all the devices and ways

he should incontinently please and gratify them in all things,

that it was his part wisely to stay those who would in a rage
